      "*********\n",
      "So why should you care about the magic ingredient of great presentation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well it 's very important right ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It ’ s really important to understand that we all have to listen to presentation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Wouldn ’ t it be great if they weren ’ t all so boring ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But we don ’ t just listen to presentation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "we also have to give presentations right ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "How many of you ever have to give presentation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I think if we ’ re honest we all do .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Sooner or later at school or at work\n",

      "and also in interview\n",
      "*********\n",
      "we all have to present with or without slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and it ’ s how well we present\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that will make a huge difference to how well we succeed .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That ’ s why you should care .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So that ’ s the first magic ingredient : the audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Always make it special for them .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The second magic ingredient is the speaker .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now you ’ re probably looking at me and thinking :\n",
      "*********\n",
      "“ Well Phil not very magical . ”\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Thanks by the way !\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But it ’ s really important that you put something of yourself in there\n",
      "*********\n",
      "something only you can say .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "This doesn ’ t mean you tell them what you had for breakfast\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but it doe mean that if someone else\n",
      "*********\n",
      "could give the exact same presentation in your place\n",
      "*********\n",
      "then you didn ’ t put anything personal into it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And that matter because when you share\n",
      "*********\n",
      "we care .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So show why you care why it ’ s important to you .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Tell u example and story from your experience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And that will make it more personal and more memorable .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So those are the first two magic ingredient :\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the audience and the speaker .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I know it doesn ’ t sound very magical\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but you ’ d be amazed how many presentation have neither of them .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So the third magic ingredient is transformation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now most presentation aim only to inform their audience\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and it doesn ’ t work very well .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let me take out my magic wand because I ’ m going to do a disappearing trick\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because like this guy\n",
      "*********\n",
      "we forget most of what we hear very quickly indeed .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But good presentation are not about information\n",
      "*********\n",
      "they are about transformation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "They are about changing something in what your audience belief\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in what they feel in what they do .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Imagine you are making a pitch\n",
      "*********\n",
      "for raising fund for a project or a start .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "After your pitch the audience know everything they need to know\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but they don ’ t fund you .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Did you succeed ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "No .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now imagine that after your pitch your audience doe give you the fund\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because they feel confident and trusting\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and they believe that your project will be successful\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and that it is a good investment .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "All of that is not information it ’ s transformation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So it ’ s easy for me to say “ Don ’ t inform transform ! ”\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but how ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well every magician need a magic wand and here is yours .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It ’ s called the  Audience Transformation Roadmap . ''\n",
      "*********\n",
      "This is a really simple but amazingly powerful technique\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to understand what your transformational objective are\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then to brainstorm\n",
      "*********\n",
      "what you can say show and do to transform your audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So here ’ s how it work .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "To understand how to take your audience on a transformational journey\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you first need to work out where they are starting from .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So we ask ourselves four simple question :\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What doe my audience know before my presentation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do they know about the subject ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do they believe ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And what do they feel ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now the difference between the two\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is believing is something you think and feeling is an emotion .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So for example I believe it ’ s time for dinner\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I feel hungry .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "See the difference ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Right .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what do they know believe and feel and lastly what do they do ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now this could be nothing maybe they do nothing relevant\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or maybe they do something that you need to change .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So once you ’ ve worked out where they are before\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you can then take them to where you want them to go afterwards .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And we ask the same four question but in the reverse order .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So now we know what they do before .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do we want them to do after the presentation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do they need to feel ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What should they believe differently to feel and do those thing ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And lastly what do they need to know ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And when you follow this process\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you realize very quickly that the real transformation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "are not in what they know it ’ s in what they believe and feel and do .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That ’ s what make the difference .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Once we ’ ve understood where they are and where we need to take them\n",
      "*********\n",
      "then we can fill in the Transformation Column\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with all of the idea on what we can say in our presentation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to make those transformation in our audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And that give u the content of the presentation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Clear so far ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Maybe we should take an example so let ’ s take one !\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let ’ s assume that I am going to make a presentation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I 'd like to explain the three magic ingredient of a great presentation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I ’ d like to make my audience want to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what doe my audience know before the presentation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well they know that most presentation aren ’ t exactly successful\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and they know TED is the exception that prof that rule .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do they believe ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Probably like most people they believe presentation are for sharing information .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It might be wrong but that doesn ’ t stop them believing it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do they feel about presentation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Probably bored but also resigned to a really ineffective way of presenting\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because that ’ s just what everyone doe .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And lastly what do they do ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well when it ’ s their turn to present\n",
      "*********\n",
      "they generally will pack thing full of information\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and they won ’ t personalize it to their audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what do I want them to do after my presentation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well afterwards I ’ m going to want them\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to aim to transform their audience every time they present\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to change something in their audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I ’ m going to need them to personalize their presentation every time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And also I ’ d like them to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because I know it will help them to succeed .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do they need to feel to do those thing ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well If they still feel bored or resigned they ’ re not going to do very much .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So they need to feel curious about this new technique\n",
      "*********\n",
      "they need to feel motivated to try it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and optimistic that it can work for them .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What do they need to believe to feel those thing ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "They ’ ll need to believe that the Roadmap\n",
      "*********\n",
      "can actually help them to succeed in their presentation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Lastly what do they need to know to believe feel and do those thing ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well they ’ ll need to know the three magic ingredient that ’ s pretty basic .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "They 'll need to know presentation are bad at information\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but great at transformation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And they ’ ll need to know how to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "OK now we ’ ve worked out where they were and where I want to take them .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What can I do now ? I fill in the Transformation Column .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what can I say or show or do to make those transformation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now usually I ’ m using a flip and some sticky note here .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So I ’ m going to use virtual sticky note .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let ’ s start at the top .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "We need to make sure they know the three magic ingredient\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so I ’ m going to need to talk at some point about the audience\n",
      "*********\n",
      "about the speaker and the transformation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "They need to know presentation are bad at information\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so maybe I should tell them that we forget most of what we hear very quickly .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And perhaps I can find a visual way to show that a well .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What next ? They need to know how to use the Roadmap so I ’ d better show it to them\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I guess I could make it even clearer by going through an example .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "They need to believe\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that the Roadmap can help them to succeed in their presentation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So I ’ ll need to show how easy it is\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to take all of these sticky note off of the Transformation Column\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and arrange them in a suitable order\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to create the storyline for their presentation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It really is a short .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "OK now I need to make them curious .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now to make them curious I ’ m going to need to make them care\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and to make them care I need to show that I care .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So I probably need to explain that most presentation really don ’ t succeed\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and that I care about fixing that .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And then to make them care\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I ’ m going to need to find out how relevant it is to them .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Perhaps I could ask them how many of them actually need to present\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and of course I know the answer is pretty much everybody .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I need to make them motivated and optimistic .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well I can make them optimistic by explaining how easy this is to use\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but also how powerful it is .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And to motivate them to try it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I ’ m going to need to explain that successful presentation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "can really make a difference to how well they succeed in life .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Lastly to make them do these thing I ’ ll need a call to action\n",
      "*********\n",
      "which focus on what I want them to do afterwards .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So there we have it !\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That ’ s a very accelerated version of the brainstorming\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but it doesn ’ t need to take long .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What we have now is just enough relevant idea\n",
      "*********\n",
      "on how we can transform our audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what happens next ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well this is where I ’ m going to take my magic wand out again\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because this is where the presentation magic happens .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "This is where you can take all the sticky note off of the Transformation Column\n",
      "*********\n",
      "prepare a suitably magical story line\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then arrange all of these idea back into that story line\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and hey presto there is my presentation !\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now you might recognize this one because ...\n",
      "*********\n",
      "this is the presentation you have been watching for the last ten minute .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And this is where we are now .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Isn ’ t that magic ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So now you know what happens next !\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Next I need to explain how simple this can be and how powerful .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And it ’ s so simple that it doesn ’ t take an expert .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Thousands of people have already used this technique\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to prepare and deliver fantastic presentation of all kind\n",
      "*********\n",
      "from TED talk to the boardroom .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But more than presentation they ’ ve used it also for email\n",
      "*********\n",
      "for proposal for preparing interview for preparing conference …\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Basically it work in any situation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "where you need to change what people believe feel and do .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You really don ’ t need a magic wand .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "This is all the magic you need .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Thank you .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Thank you . So now I need to give you a call to action and here it is .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Remember those three magic ingredient of every great presentation :\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the audience the speaker\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",
      "Try using the Audience Transformation Roadmap for your next presentation\n",

      "I ca n't cure the world of bad presentation on my own .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But together we really can make a difference !\n",

      "So by all mean share this with anyone you know\n",

      "who need a dose of presentation magic .\n",

      "but you all know someone .\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",
      "focus not on informing but on transforming your audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That ’ s where the magic happens\n",

      "how to practice a speech .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let 's get into those detail .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Hello there friend .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Alex Lyon and we are at the end of a three series\n",
      "*********\n",
      "on public speaking this month .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The first video is on the importance of public speaking .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The one before this is on how to improve\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and this one is specifically on how to practice a speech .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So let 's get into the five way\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that I recommend you practicing a speech\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and at the end of this video you may wan na stick around\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because I have a couple of resource to suggest\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to help you move your public speaking to the next level .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So the first way to practice a speech\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is to practice from an outline .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Not word for word note .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I 've given some version of this tip\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in a lot of different video but let 's say it clearly .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You must practice from an outline a bare bone outline\n",
      "*********\n",
      "if you want to sound conversational\n",
      "*********\n",
      "which is really what your listener want from you .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "They do n't want you to read your speech\n",
      "*********\n",
      "they do n't want you to sound like you 've memorized it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "They want a conversation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And the way to get there is this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You take whatever note you have to prepare at first\n",
      "*********\n",
      "your first few draft\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then you just keep cutting them down over and over again\n",
      "*********\n",
      "every time you practice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "until all you 're left with is a bulleted outline\n",
      "*********\n",
      "of your key point that you are going to hit .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That 's all you really want in the end .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And that way you have a safety net to fall back on\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so you wo n't ever lose your place .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You can just glance down at your note\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then bounce your eye right back up\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and present from an outline .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That 's the best way .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Practice from an outline\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and in the end present like an outline .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "One of the thing I will do in fact is\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so I do n't sound like I 've memorized it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I do n't sound like a robot\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is every time I practice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I might say it a little differently on purpose\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so that I 'm not tempted to memorize .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So do n't try to put it word for word do n't try to memorize .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Talking point only and practice from that kind of outline .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The number two tip on how to practice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is to spread out your practice session over time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do n't cram the night before .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do n't cram the morning before your presentation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I recommend spreading your practice session out\n",
      "*********\n",
      "over three day .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The idea is to practice about three time each day\n",
      "*********\n",
      "over those three day .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I like to practice about 10 time\n",
      "*********\n",
      "before I stand up and speak\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and it 's really easier to do if you spread it out .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "A lot of great thing happen\n",
      "*********\n",
      "when you spread out your practice session .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The first thing that happens to me is it calm me down .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It say to me hey there 's time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So if my earliest few practice session practice time\n",
      "*********\n",
      "do n't go so well I say hey there 's time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "No problem I got a few more day .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I 'll work out these kink .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Another great thing that happens is\n",
      "*********\n",
      "let 's say I 've practiced it three time\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then I sleep on it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Oftentimes in the middle of the day\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I 'm doing other thing I 'm washing dish\n",
      "*********\n",
      "my brain keep working on it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and keep figuring out better way to say something\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or a quicker way to get to the point .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So in that downtime I believe that our brain\n",
      "*********\n",
      "are still working on it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and we benefit from that downtime a well .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The other great thing about breaking up\n",
      "*********\n",
      "your practice session is it help me\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with my composure in the moment .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Because it feel to me like muscle memory with an athlete\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that I 've done this before .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I 've been doing this presentation for day .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So it really help me stay composed and in the moment .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So spread out those practice session three time a day\n",
      "*********\n",
      "over three day .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That usually is about what you need .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The number three tip is to focus\n",
      "*********\n",
      "on only one or two improvement\n",
      "*********\n",
      "each time you practice it through .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So you might just work on your structure and your outline\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in the first few time through that 's normal .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The next few time through just pick one or two thing\n",
      "*********\n",
      "like oh now I 'm just gon na work on looking up\n",
      "*********\n",
      "form my outline eye contact for example .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The next time through you might just work on gesture\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and your posture a little bit .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Every time you practice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "add one or two thing you wan na improve on\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because when you add too many thing all at once\n",
      "*********\n",
      "when you try to get it perfect every time you practice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you 're going to get paralyzed\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because you ca n't really improve more than one thing\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or maybe two thing in any given practice session\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so focus on improvement\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then start checking those off the list .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And then your fundamental will all be in place\n",
      "*********\n",
      "by the time you actually stand up to present .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Number four tip is to keep practice session realistic .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do not for example the whole time you 're practicing\n",
      "*********\n",
      "isolate yourself completely and make condition perfect .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Because what end up happening in the moment\n",
      "*********\n",
      "of your actual presentation is it wo n't go perfectly .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "People will walk in late\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or they 'll get up to use the bathroom\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or there 'll be somebody\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with a lawn mower outside your window .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "In fact I 've been recording this morning\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and there is a neighbor working with a chainsaw nearby\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that keep distracting me but you just power through it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So after a few time practicing alone\n",
      "*********\n",
      "what I end up doing when I practice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is I add distraction on purpose .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Like I will put the television or some music on\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then I 'll talk over that\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because it creates a little bit of noise\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and distraction for me to cope with\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I know that if I can practice through those distraction\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that during the actual moment I 'll be ready to push through .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Even if something weird or odd happens\n",

      "one thought one look .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "In other word about a sentence or a half a sentence\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then move on to the next person .\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",
      "if you 're not used to it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It can feel very awkward looking right into someone 's eye\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but you have to gear up for this\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because that 's what audience want .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "We want people to connect with this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you 're not looking into our eye\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and making u feel like we 're part of this\n",
      "*********\n",
      "then you 're not going to have much of an impact .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The next thing you want to do is do n't\n",
      "*********\n",
      "rather this is a do n't\n",
      "*********\n",
      "do n't clutter up all your note\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with too many detail .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "A lot of time we 're tempted to jam our note\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or our powerpoints with everything we want to say .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But the result is when we 're nervous in the moment\n",
      "*********\n",
      "we end up just locked in to our note\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and looking down the whole time and reading\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and sounding really stiff really wooden\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and you 're not going to again connect with people .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what you want to do instead\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is pare down your note\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so that you can just have a conversational style\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with your audience .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And again a you 're practicing\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you have to whittle down those note\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so that all you have is like talking point\n",
      "*********\n",
      "like a little grocery list of item\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that you 're going to talk about .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And it almost force you or at least free you\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to connect with people to look up\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and to have a nice normal conversation with them\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in your natural personality .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The next do n't is you do n't want to load up your slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with all complicated animation and text .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And one of the reason is you do n't want\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to stare at it and read from it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The other reason is that it 's very hard to follow\n",
      "*********\n",
      "what 's going on if your slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "are jam with the detail .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What you want to do instead is to make sure\n",
      "*********\n",
      "your slide are nice and clear\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and simple and help you make whatever point\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you 're making in that particular moment .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "A rule of thumb that I like to use\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is if you 're spending more than about two or three minute\n",
      "*********\n",
      "on each PowerPoint slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "then you 're probably wasting your time\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I do n't recommend using more than a couple of slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "for a presentation anyway if you 're a beginner\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because people tend to over rely on the slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and load up each single slide with way too much .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The next do n't is do n't fidget .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do n't fidget with your hand .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do n't fidget with your foot .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do n't pace back and forth aimlessly\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because you 're nervous .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What you want to do instead is have nice confident posture\n",
      "*********\n",
      "where you stand in one place for a little while\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then if you want to move with a purpose move\n",
      "*********\n",
      "stand in another place for a while\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then share another part of your message .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Move for the purpose stand still\n",
      "*********\n",
      "share some of your message .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do n't just pace\n",
      "*********\n",
      "have nice confident posture .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Same thing with your hand .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You want to use gesture\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and emphasize your idea with your hand .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You do n't want to fidget and put them in your pocket\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or play with a pen or do anything else weird\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or distracting like that .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That 's a big part of how you come across non\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I recommend to you when you 're practicing\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you work on this a well .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And the last do n't undo is how you use your voice .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What you do n't want to do is speak too softly\n",
      "*********\n",
      "use a lot of filler like um and ah and so .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What you want to do is have a confident voice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "where you speak loud like to the back of the room\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with a nice clear volume .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Aim for the back of the room because just think about it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you have to reach those people .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The other thing you want to do is emphasize\n",
      "*********\n",
      "your key word with the sound of your voice\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and also pause after you share a key idea\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or a key thought .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Pause for a minute silently .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do n't fill it up with an um or an oh\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the pause is much more effective .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So here are some do and don'ts\n",
      "*********\n",
      "some tip for beginner .\n",

      "*********\n",
      "are n't engaging the audience at all .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "In fact many are hard to read and understand .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But there are a few really important\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and easy to implement tip that can really make a difference\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in your slide design .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let 's check them out .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Before we get started a brief thanks to Skillshare\n",
      "*********\n",
      "for sponsoring today 's video .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Skillshare is a learning platform\n",

      "*********\n",
      "and I 'll be chatting more about them towards the end .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now let 's get started with my slide design tip .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Number one visualize your data .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Presenting number and data can be a challenge .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "For one it 's probably not the most exciting topic .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And second if you put a lot of data on your slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the audience is going to be busy reading the slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "instead of paying attention to you .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Here 's an example a slide like this\n",
      "*********\n",
      "encourages the audience to read and try to make sense\n",
      "*********\n",
      "of the data .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Their attention is going to be on the slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "not on what you 're saying .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Instead you could present it like this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Already from the title of the slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the audience can get the critical information .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The supporting chart make it easier\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to interpret the slide .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The important thing here is that you guide the eye\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to the most important topic and avoid distraction\n",
      "*********\n",
      "on the slide .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Which brings me to my next tip .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Number two use white space and do n't clutter .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "White or negative space refers to the empty space\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in between your content on the slide .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Sometimes we feel the urge to make use of\n",
      "*********\n",
      "every little space available to u on the slide .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "We plaster it with information and visual element\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but more is n't necessarily always better .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you throw too much on the screen\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you get a cluttered page that 's unattractive\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and difficult to read .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "People get frustrated when information bombard them\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you 're going to lose their attention .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So do n't do that .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "White space is also important\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because it creates separation between the object\n",
      "*********\n",
      "on your slide and it focus the eye and the message\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you want to get across .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It also make text easier to read .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And also for the viewer it 's calming letting them breathe .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And do n't get me wrong\n",
      "*********\n",
      "white space doe n't have to be white .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "White space can also be any solid color\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or even a blurred background .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It just mean that there is no other content\n",

      "Now my objective for this evening for these 18 minute\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is to give you five design principle\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that will cognitively and psychologically optimise your PowerPoint slide .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And if you have n't used them before\n",
      "*********\n",
      "they will make a tremendous difference\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to every PowerPoint you 'll be delivering from this day and on .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So let 's start .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The first one of these five is one message .\n",

      "*********\n",
      "You 've got two message .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let 's move one of them out of the way and just bring one message per slide . '\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So why should we only have one message per slide ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well I 'll give you this beautiful example .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You 're at this nice party you 've got the music going boom\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you 've got this person you 're chatting away to\n",

      "you 're having a good time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And then you hear your name ; you hear your name spoken somewhere .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Your entire attention is now diverted in that direction\n",

      "hoping that you 're nodding in the right instance yeah ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Yes yes yes .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "After a minute this one stop talking about you\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so you divert your attention straight again .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now that person will then say 'Well do n't you agree ? '\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And do n't we just love that situation ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "We have got no clue what they 've been talking about .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The same thing go for PowerPoint .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you 've got more than one message\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the chance is big they will be focusing on this one and not that one\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or that one and not this one .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Just make it simple for human being .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Have one message per slide .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "We are extremely limited to understanding more .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let 's move on . Go to working memory .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I 've already given you this bad vibe that your working memory is bad\n",

      "*********\n",
      "I 'm coming with worse news and it go like this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "This equation ha the basis of John Sweller and Mayer\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and they come to the conclusion\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that there is something in our brain called 'the redundancy effect '\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and it work like this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you have text sentence on your PowerPoint\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and you persist with the annoying idea of speaking at the same time\n",
      "*********\n",
      "what will be remembered by the audience\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is zero .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Or very close to zero .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now why is that ? How doe that come about ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well it ca n't look like this . It 's just not practical .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You ca n't stand and have this and talk at the same time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what are you supposed to do ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well use PowerPoint for what it 's supposed to be used for .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Pick it like this pull down your text into the documentation field\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and use the area up there for the presentation material :\n",
      "*********\n",
      "short sweet bit of text and an image .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That is what enhances your image .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That is what enhances your message .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So use PowerPoint a it 's supposed to be used .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Come to the third of these five principle\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and that 's size .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Before I go into that\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",
      "Every time you open your eye for the rest of your life\n",

      "you will focus on four thing :\n",
      "*********\n",
      "moving object signalling colour like red orange and yellow\n",
      "*********\n",
      "contrast object and big object for the rest of your life .\n",

      "*********\n",
      "No . Why not ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Because it 's got moving object\n",
      "*********\n",
      "it 's got signalling colour it 's high in contrast\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and they 're usually very big these time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So why not use this to our benefit ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you look at this where is your attention drawn to\n",
      "*********\n",
      "without you even having a chance of controlling it ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It 's going to the big three all the time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Have a look at the practical situation ; have a look at this .\n",

      "Where are your eye drawn to ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I can see that they 're drawn constantly to the headline .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now how often is the headline the most important part in a PowerPoint ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It 's very rare .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Even so every PowerPoint template is built like this\n",
      "*********\n",
      "where the headline is the biggest object and the content is the smallest\n",
      "*********\n",
      "going absolute opposite to our biological reaction .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what doe this look like if we just show you an example ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well now I 've reduced the title and it look like this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Do you see how your eye now fall down into the content ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now they 're sucked into the headline\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and now they 're falling down into the content .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So I can control exactly where you are\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but why do people build PowerPoints\n",
      "*********\n",
      "where people will be spending 70 % of the time on the headline\n",
      "*********\n",
      "when it 's not the most important part ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what I want you to take with you from this\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is the most important part of your PowerPoint\n",
      "*********\n",
      "should also be the biggest nothing else .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Moving on to number four contrast .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Contrast control your focus .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what doe that look like ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "For instance if I show you a list like this\n",
      "*********\n",
      "your eye are over the place\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because you do n't really know what to focus on .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So I 'll use a built functionality into PowerPoint which go like this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I 'll show you the first subject I 'll take it away with contrast\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I 'll show you the second one\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I 'll do it again and again and again and again .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You 're now following exactly the white spot .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If I do this dun\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I can see your eye just wobbling around\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and you 're a bit like a kitten going after a little laser pointer on the wall\n",
      "*********\n",
      "going like 'Where is it ? I 've got it . I 've got it . '\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Because you 're following where the white spot is and not the rest .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now this is a beautiful example .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Please do use this .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Use it because you can show amazing big table like this\n",
      "*********\n",
      "if you use the effect of contrast the principle of contrast .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Look what this look like .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Your eye are all over the place ; you do n't know what to focus on\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but I just apply the principle of contrast\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and it look like that and suddenly you know exactly what to focus on .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Here they 're all over the place\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and here they 're exactly where I want them .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now there 's a big major drawback with PowerPoints\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and that is that the majority of company on this earth today\n",
      "*********\n",
      "they persist in having white background in PowerPoint .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Look at that .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Oh it 's bright it 's shiny .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Could you tell me who ha the highest contrast me or the screen ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well the screen .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Who 's usually the biggest me or the screen ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Well the screen .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So the only option I have is dress myself up in signalling colour\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and jump around on stage in order to balance that problem out\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and that is obviously not a good corporate strategy\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in the long term would it be ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I think the long strategy is to just switch it around .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "PowerPoint is not supposed to have white background .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If I do this your eye relax .\n",

      "You focus on me .\n",

      "I 'm the biggest object .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I 'm the most contrast object .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I got your focus .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Why is that important ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "It 's important because I am I always have been\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and I always will be the presentation .\n",

      "*********\n",
      "Now this is one of the most severe principle\n",

      "How many object do I have here ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you count them quickly you 'll see that I 've got 16 .\n",

      "Do you see this little beauty at the end a well\n",
      "*********\n",
      "which go 'page 12 of 95 ' ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What is that ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Why do we do that ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That only creates anxiety .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If anything you are 'Oh my god I ca n't take 83 more of those . '\n",

      "*********\n",
      "Alright let 's jump into it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So let 's start with some basic .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Some basic element that should be included\n",
      "*********\n",
      "on every single page .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So let 's start here on the bottom .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "What you see here is the date .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The current date .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And pretty frequently you put here the date\n",
      "*********\n",
      "either when the presentation happened\n",
      "*********\n",
      "where you present your page\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or when you created a document .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Because what you will also find is that many document\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in professional context\n",
      "*********\n",
      "many presentation many slide\n",
      "*********\n",
      "are not actually created for actual presentation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but rather a a document that is then circulated\n",
      "*********\n",
      "sent around in a company .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And a date is just important\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because when in retrospect\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you 're able to actually know\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to understand when the document wa created .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Which of course is important in many way .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The second thing that you 'll include on\n",
      "*********\n",
      "pretty much every page\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is a page number .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "This of course is very useful if you sit\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in a meeting and just a colleague want\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to refer to a specific page .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Then to be able to say okay\n",
      "*********\n",
      "this is a page 18 and then everybody know\n",
      "*********\n",
      "what page 18 exactly is\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because there is a page number included on the document .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Then of course is very important .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Next thing you should look at is the source .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So here you can include a source\n",
      "*********\n",
      "such a Firm Learning .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Of course you can even then include just your name\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or your department a a source\n",
      "*********\n",
      "but even better would be especially if you refer to a\n",
      "*********\n",
      "specific data then also give the source of the data .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what date are you using ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Where is the data coming from ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "When wa the date collected ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Some specific information on what data you 're using\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is what you can likely include here in the source .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The next element that you can use are footnote .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So footnote one two three this is just a part where\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you can give specific detail on certain thing .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But maybe just not fit in the\n",
      "*********\n",
      "regular text on your page .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Then you would just include it in the footnote\n",
      "*********\n",
      "to give you some extra space\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because it 's often a smaller font size\n",
      "*********\n",
      "than the main page .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Just to show additional remark .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And of course\n",
      "*********\n",
      "one of the most important element\n",
      "*********\n",
      "of every page is the action title .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The action title is the title of the page .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And creating a good action title is an art form itself .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now I will not go into much of detail\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in this video what a good action title look like\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because I already created a specific video\n",
      "*********\n",
      "only focusing on action title .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The video even includes an exercise how you can\n",
      "*********\n",
      "improve your action title creation skill .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you 're interested in that\n",
      "*********\n",
      "have a look .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I will include a link to the video above\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so that you can directly look into it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So far so good .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So this wa some just really bare basic\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that should be included in every page .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Let 's jump into something else .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And this is the creation of chart .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So what you will see in consulting\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is that almost every slide that you use\n",
      "*********\n",
      "contains a chart .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So some kind of diagram where you depict data .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The reason is that in consulting\n",
      "*********\n",
      "very frequently your argumentation will be based on data .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You can just expect from you\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that you will back up your finding\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and your recommendation with some date analysis .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And if you do these kind of data analysis\n",
      "*********\n",
      "of course you will frequently use chart to then\n",
      "*********\n",
      "show the result of your analysis .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And these are just the chart that you can create\n",
      "*********\n",
      "with the think expansion .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you do not know think\n",
      "*********\n",
      "it 's a plugin that very frequently is used\n",
      "*********\n",
      "by consulting firm to create the chart .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So almost every consulting firm us it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Of course if you do not have it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "you can just also work with the regular\n",
      "*********\n",
      "PowerPoint built chart .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you have the opportunity to use think\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I can highly recommend it\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because it really improves your workflow .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "If you now go over this chart tile\n",
      "*********\n",
      "many of them you will already know\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and probably frequently use yourself .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Such a stacked bar chart or the 100 % bar chart\n",
      "*********\n",
      "clustered bar chart and so on .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Right now I 'd just like to put your attention to\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the waterfall chart type .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So the waterfall chart type is a chart type\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that in consulting\n",
      "*********\n",
      "especially at McKinsey you will use all of the time .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So there 's almost no presentation\n",
      "*********\n",
      "without a waterfall present .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But outside of consulting I really rarely see it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Just from my observation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "The fact alone that a presentation includes a\n",
      "*********\n",
      "waterfall chart very often is a clear telltale sign\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that a MBB consulting firm worked on it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And actually most of the case it ha been McKinsey\n",
      "*********\n",
      "because for whatever reason\n",
      "*********\n",
      "waterfall chart are just so commonly used\n",
      "*********\n",
      "by McKinsey consultant .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So let 's look at an example .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So this is just a basic example\n",
      "*********\n",
      "of what a waterfall chart look like .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And I 'd just like to use this example to show to you\n",
      "*********\n",
      "what I believe the waterfall chart can just be so\n",
      "*********\n",
      "helpful in so many business presentation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So this of course is just a stylist chart\n",

      "*********\n",
      "That there is a hostile client\n",

      "*********\n",
      "Right ?\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",
      "But then you can say  Yes Mister this is true you are ''\n",
      "*********\n",
      " right but a you can also read here this wa not a final ''\n",
      "*********\n",
      " version of the analysis . ''\n",
      "*********\n",
      " This wa just a preliminary version . ''\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And incident like that happen .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And this is why you put the preliminary sticker on it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That 's similar but different is the indicative sticker\n",

      "maybe ha some flaw\n",
      "*********\n",
      "maybe ha some drawback .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So the number that you show\n",

      "indicatively right\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and these show the right direction\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the right picture\n",
      "*********\n",
      "even thought the specific number that you use\n",
      "*********\n",
      "might not be accurate .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And this of course can happen in any situation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You need to work with the incomplete data set\n",

      "where you 're lacking certain information\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that you just were not able to use .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Then you might want to make it clear that the\n",

      "analysis that you 're showing is just indicative .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Illustrative go kind of even further than indicative .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And it 's sometimes also used a bit in a dirty way\n",
      "*********\n",
      "in the sense that you can show a whole chart of very\n",
      "*********\n",
      "specific information very specific graph\n",
      "*********\n",
      "then you can put an illustrative sticker on it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "You can make it clear that actually\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the number are not true .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "That you just made up the whole chart right ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Maybe the whole chart doe n't contain\n",
      "*********\n",
      "any real number at all .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But you just wanted to show a certain relationship\n",
      "*********\n",
      "how you believe that it is from your experience\n",
      "*********\n",
      "or maybe from other information that you have .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So you 're just drawing this chart\n",
      "*********\n",
      "which maybe not even contains any real number at all\n",

      "it look like .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So this is how you put the illustrative sticker on it .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So if you see the illustrative sticker on a presentation\n",

      "pretty frequently you can assume that actually\n",

      "You 're going to have a series of episode or data dive\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that you 're going to present little story and a you 're presenting a particular story you 're going to start at a level\n",

      "*********\n",
      "and then we conclude and it 's over we 've lost people along the way . So this structure this visual structure here is a way of planning your talk\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so that you can think about diving down into data and then coming up for air\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and it 's at these transition point between data dive that you use your home image to basically let the audience member\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",
      "You 've already seen the introduction to the seminar you 've already seen how I introduced\n",

      "my home slide . At this point in my talk I 've gone through a review of the literature\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the first data dive and I 'm now beginning part two of the talk . And here 's the beginning of that section . So once again you see\n",

      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "this home image and you see the two question . We 're half way through the talk but I 'm summarizing part one\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and getting ready to introduce the second set of question . At this point then I now start to explain that a we focus on the blue cell\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that we 're going to be looking at the role of a separate protein that is actually expressed in a subset of neuron within the different layer .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And then I explain that we 've generated knock mouse in which we 've inserted a reporter into the cell that normally express this protein\n",
      "*********\n",
      "so that we can see their axonal connection . And now we do n't really need to focus on the data but look there 's a sentence\n",
      "*********\n",
      "at the top that basically say what I just told you then we see a simple figure from the control in which I would point out that what I want the audience to look at\n",
      "*********\n",
      "are the blue axon that label the connection between the two hemisphere . That 's in the control then we look at the mutant the thing I 'm going to emphasize\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is the absence of those connection here . Now we 're going to look at it from the side same stuff sentence two simple image\n",
      "*********\n",
      "word will match the content were I really delivering the seminar to you . And then I tell you what I told just told you .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I just told you that the blue cell express this protein that they form this type of connection\n",

      "and then I say you know in the first part of the talk I told you about another pathway .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So you might be wondering what is the relationship between these two pathway ? So then I will go on to actually test that connection by presenting more data\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that would then build up into a small conclusion slide showing you that this protein represses the expression of this gene .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So simple graphic that really emphasize the bottom line\n",
      "*********\n",
      "the story that I 'm telling you with the minimum essential data . Ok so we 've gone through the meat thinking about data dive coming back making transition .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Now let 's think about how to conclude a talk . Here 's the good news is that a you say\n",

      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",

      "So they say in conclusion blah blah blah blah blah blah and then they say `` and now in part two of my talk '' and what 's our response a an audience ?\n",
      "*********\n",
      "We 're like `` oooh dude no '' . Why is that ? It 's because it wa a false ending . And it got u all excited . So if you 're going to conclude part one of your talk\n",

      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",

      "do the audience of favor of saying to some sum up this first part of the seminar and that way you wo n't create a false expectation .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "But the good news is you will perk up interest a you signal your conclusion and that mean that you have one last chance to really reiterate your specific conclusion\n",
      "*********\n",

      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "And return to the beginning to have your talk come full circle so that you 're really ending by revisiting the big question\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that you introduced at the very first part of the talk . So again here 's how I would do it in my talk just a a visual\n",
      "*********\n",
      "example of how one might think about this . Concluding up now sentence at the top the same diagram that you 've seen before\n",
      "*********\n",
      "about this repression and now adding other thing you have n't seen in the data but I would add that just to remind them\n",
      "*********\n",
      "that at least one of these mechanism work through the modulation of chromatin they would have seen that slide already .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I would then connect it back to the first part of the talk and talk about a little switch that had gotten set up .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I would then refer back even earlier to a part of the talk that you did n't see now going back to the really big picture\n",

      "*********\n",
      "I would then wrap up by acknowledging of course the colleague that have contributed to the work over time\n",
      "*********\n",
      "and then here 's a trick a you get to the very end of your talk rather than leaving up your acknowledgement slide\n",

      "have your conclusion slide appear at the very end . For the question and answer period .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "nan\n",
      "*********\n",
      "Why is that ? Well it help the audience . Remember everything is in service of the audience and I actually have the misfortune\n",
      "*********\n",
      "of working on three gene all of which have name that end in two and none of which are memorable by anyone who doe n't work on them .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "So by putting this picture up I 'm enabling the audience to actually ask intelligent question .\n",
      "*********\n",
      "First you know if they 're struggling to remember which gene they had a question about and secondly when I 'm answering a question\n",
      "*********\n",
      "I can actually use the visuals to explain my answer . And that turn out to be very helpful . So I really recommend that at the end of your talk\n",

      "*********\n",

      "Third think of the talk a consisting of these episode or little data dive in which you 're going to go\n",
      "*********\n",
      "at a point into your data remember the minimum essential data and then you 're going to go into some depth but then you come up for air\n",

      "and allow the audience to regroup see where you 've just been frame the next question and then get there logically rather than just going through data data data data\n",
      "*********\n",
      "which wa just going to leave people in the dust . A very effective way of making these transition explicit\n",
      "*********\n",
      "is to design a home slide or a home image that is a signal to the audience that you 're at a point of transition\n",
      "*********\n",

      "nan   !=   yoD8RMq2OkU48\n",

      "yoD8RMq2OkU48   !=   nan\n",

      "Right .\n",
      "\n",
