Delivery,Giving numbers meaning with analogy
No,"The individual items on the slide were good as they were visual representations of what he was saying, allowing audiences to visualize as they listened without being distracting, however the slide itself was too busy with too many things on it and the tree background."
No,The tree link was good as it tied his points together.
No,The story aspect made the speech considerably more engaging than it may have otherwise been.
Delivery,Well rehearsed and personable
Delivery,"The good thing about this presenter is that he has taglines. He opens his presentation and closes it with remarks. So, he put things clear for the audience to understand.

Delivery,"Strong relateability to a well known topic, and used enthusiasm and confidence to boost the audiences attention effectively as well as other delivery techniques"
Delivery,Engaging beginning
No,"GOOD: Putting pictures of things that didn't seem to relate to each other on the slide and then showing during the course of the presentation how they worked together was an excellent way for the audience to interested in the talk - ""How does lego and chess relate to computers?"""

Delivery,Very clear explanations of what are complex points

No,Clear and to the point
No,"Reflection of presentation skills.//Good engaging story in the opening about the trees to get interest. //Great varied tone in speech delivery and use of non verbal skills and lots of gesturing. Perhaps there is too much gesturing, it is more helpful when he uses fewer gestures.//His structure seems unclear to me. Great introduction but he forgot to take me on the journey, though perhaps scientists may have understood his links. Fantastic conclusion, clear and purposeful."
No,"I couldn't see the visual (the tree), however, the mental picture the speaker painted regarding the bark, the chessboard, the pathways, were helpful as visual aids."
Delivery,speech and good language help to be confident and deliver the content.
Delivery,Not much visual explanation
Delivery,"Delivery is powerful, with a storyline. A beginning, and powerful end. He also uses humor."

No,"Presentation very visual, not too much text."
Delivery,He is good! This is not my field and I am already listening carefully
Delivery,I think this guys gestures too much. Are these gestures really relevant to his points?
No,good use of body language gesture
Delivery,Interesting opening
Delivery,"mini-joke about chemists - get audience to smile a bit, engage bit more"
Delivery,he speaks too fast
No,"I can't really see the visual aids from my point of view, so no, the visual aids are not clear."
No,The slides does not reflect what the speakers is talking about
Delivery,flowing speech - easy to follow / understand //very good pacing
No,Low eye contact
Delivery,good use of gesture
Delivery,"How the speaker gave a simple analogy made it easier for audience from a different field to relate and understand the topic and the intended message of the speech. I think in speeches, it is not so much about the speaker's knowledge but on how he is able to adjust himself to the audience's own knowledge, and build upon it to convey his message."
No,Good to start with the problem and then provide the solution.
Delivery,Meaningful number. He says in slow and clear speed.
Delivery,humour used well
Delivery,"more jokes, got a laugh, building rapport with audience//telling stories/analogies that audience can relate to (lego, amazon)"
Delivery,"introduce the topic with an understandable and interesting comparison with the subject people are familiar with, e.g. amazon books"
Delivery,personalisation and using fun in presentation / make the audience laugh
Delivery,Humour
Delivery,used humor
Delivery,"he makes jokes, this keeps the audience focused"
Delivery,Good gestures and facial expression. Like the way he is explaining complicated issues in an easy way. Always depends on the audiance.
Delivery,He has a great delivery of what he really wants to say
No,Visual aids are not really visible in this presentation... can hardly even read the text on the display in the background.
No,"for me the slide is too busy, too much info he hasn't talked about is already on it e.g. the chessboard could have come later, at first he only talks about the tree and chemical structure"
Delivery,Speech is perhaps a little fast.
No,"I am confused now that he got more technical. His hand gestures are not helping, he should be using visual aids"
Delivery,He keeps on eye contact with audience
No,"He says a lot - tells a few different related stories (chess, chemistry in general, texel). It requires concentration to listen but it works!"
Delivery,"he does quite a bit of gesturing, his hands don't relax in between"
Delivery,"In relation to the prompted question about more specifics and fewer oversimplifications, I think it depends on the audience.  As I have very little background in chemistry, bringing the ""story""  down to a more representational level was helpful to me.  If the audience was mostly biochemists, or computer programers, it would make sense to give more specifics."
No,Structure isn't particularly clear.
No,makes his work more interesting by drawing analogies to everyday things
No,For a three minute talk there is way too much simple stuff and talk about chess...
Delivery,maintaining eye contact with all people in the audience
Delivery,Using pauses effectively
Delivery,Eye contact with different people is good.
Delivery,"Well delivered crucial point: no one has actually used these algorithms for the present purposes (i.e. old knowledge - new application, makes a useful structure)."
No,he summarizes shortly what his research is about
Delivery,"He seems calm, confident, and uses his hands freely to accentuate his points."
Delivery,"Very good in giving the story, analogy and reality, but in my opinion, the presenter was a little bit nervous when delivering his idea."
No,Ended with a strong point. Good opener and closer.
Delivery,"Simple clear message at the end, good take away point."
No,the 1 slide covered the whole talk and it was quite busy. I found myself wondering about the relevance of some pictures before they were discussed which distracted from the talking for me
Delivery,good use of pauses
Delivery,introducing a question and then linking that question to introduce what his work is about... staging the presentation
No,Great and impressive ending to make us think
Delivery,Very clear conclusion which good emphasis
Delivery,Clear take home-message.
Delivery,He had great story that linked everything he works on in a way that the general audience can understand it
No,"Did not grab me at all, as I did chemistry at uni and it was too general, too vague and too oversimplified."
No,"Great story which makes good talk for public audience, but it needs more detail for an academic presentation"
No,thanking the audience for their attention
No,"This appears to be a type of ""elevator speech"" for fellow doctoral students.  Ending with, ""My work is to make better tools for better medicines"" is a strong, concise ending."
Delivery,I think he had a good delivery in the whole. He keept me attentive.//As I watched and listened I tried to imagine  applying  his strategy to my topic and I think it is posible.
Delivery,She also uses good and clear visuals
No,Very structured presentation. Using all the techniques for presenting a noteworthy presentation
No,"Opening - difficult topic and fairly detailed discussion that is quite well backed up by her visuals that are clear and powerful. //Her pacing is a bit disconcerting and makes me want to go to the toilet.//Too long and is she building to a climax? Too detailed.//Where is she going, unclear structure. What is the big deal here? Women outnumber men in social media and networking sites. Impact on culture and what mean for women? Is she building to a climax? Is it hiring women in media more? I'm bored and I'm a woman. Men must have fallen asleep in the first minute."
No,good use of visual aids help to deliver the content
No,Good opening//tell a story//not stable stance //no eye contact//delivery is good
Delivery,"very good opening, she's cathing the attention of the audience!"

Delivery,Good strong opening.  Good use of rhetorical question used as a statement.
No,Intriguing title quickly explained
No,She starts with a question and leads us follow her into the scenario.
Delivery,Good enough start
No,starts by introducing idea she wants to get across. found this really focused me on the points she made
No,interesting animation
No,these images are important for the speech!
No,setting the theme from the start
No,This part demonstrates over-explicitly how much preparation time has gone into the visuals... i.e. selecting & retrieving pics of magazine covers.
No,Effective graphics!
No,interesting visual aids that will catch the audience s attention //used to introduce the topic of the presentation about media and gender
No,Good use of visual aids highlighting point of media and distorted view of gender and lives.
No,There are many pics and animation to engage us
No,Not a very good stance...maybe she is nervous
Delivery,"she moves quite a bit, also hands are up, not relaxed"
Delivery,i found the swaying distracting
Delivery,interesting talk
No,"Very visual presentation, good analogy here."
No,"Good use of animated visuals.  Grabs attention, didn't require reading."
No,simple slides with visual aids
No,this aid might be slightly distracting getting the audience s attention away from what is actually said //though it comes to complement the verbal input
No,Very interesting animation. But it is a little hard to focus on her speech at the same time. I am not sure whether it is because I'm not a native English speaker.
No,slides are bit busy? Trying to follow and view/read the animation makes it harder to focus on what the speaker is saying
No,Her visuals are meaningful.
No,She delivered a good presentation with good visual aids.
No,The visuals are not very appealing. I am not a fan of 3D charts
No,"Lots of visual aids used, with not much text on each slide"
Delivery,Confidence and shows that she shows what she is talking about.
No,Interesting that over 54s are not included as I would have thought that is a powerful group consumer wise.
No,"Included charts and numbers, but adding clip art of people, and then removing entire groups, was successful to highlight the data without boring audience."
Delivery,providing examples to illustrate the point
No,Some great visual ads to explain things
No,Visual aids are good but sometimes overwhelming
No,adding some links to popular shows - this was probably interesting if you follow the show but a little meaningless to me as I do not
Delivery,"she's quite fast, could use more pauses"
Delivery,"Why mentioning ""psychographics"" if it has had no impact? Just makes me curious what it would look like. I think it diverts from the main points."
No,"she hasn't provided any outline of her presentation, but this is for sure on purpose, as she's playing with the surprise factor and I think that for this kind of talk this is really appropriate"
Delivery,Swaying a bit when she is talking not a good stance
Delivery,Her moving back and forth is bothering me a little.
Delivery,Clear and very comprehensive speech
No,"Opens with background information to set the scene, then swaps to her own work."
Delivery,She speaks clearly and at a good pace. Perhaps a few more pauses would help things to sink in.
Delivery,Her speech is very clear
No,"The structure is well thought out.  She is building a story, provided the background, to set the context."
Delivery,very good use of stress and intonation
No,Not well defined structure - no outline
No,established links between their work and the evidence available and introduces some important findings they have
No,slides are very simple and effective
No,Interesting that lying on line is obviously a common thing.
Delivery,"attempt at a joke, not as well received as previous speaker"
Delivery,Good projection and pace.
Delivery,Paces around quite a lot.
No,Good visuals here.
Delivery,"Speaker is easy to follow.  Speech is slow enough, and she varies her voice level when she wants to highlight a point."
No,I still cant see the focus of the presentation being on gender...
No,"Good structure; started with an ""outrageous"" claim then explained in detail before going into specifics of research."
Delivery,"doesn't seem to make real eye contact, looks away quite quickly"
No,creepy verses interesting!!!
Delivery,Good Point. I like that she points out our tastes are not being presumed now.
Delivery,"Although this point (shared interest) is being repeated I think it could have been delivered more concisely, with greater emphasis and visuals. A lot of talking around it."
Delivery,Words emphasis is good.
Delivery,The speaker is swaying a bit too much.  It's not possible to see if she is providing eye contact as the video cuts between her face and the slides.
Delivery,"speaks clearly, loudness is good"
No,I can't follow and it seems that there is no logical structure or story to follow which makes me forget what she just said.
No,"graph is hard to interpret because of shapes used, especially further from axis"
No,No citations?
No,Visual aid is easy to understand
No,very good use of visual aids to illustrate the findings of their research
No,Charts are not labeled. And the graphics are still very distracting.
No,"Again, a good use of animated visual to highlight what could be dry data in chart form."
Delivery,she uses very well her voice and the pauses
Delivery,Great connection between visual and expression . I love this part.
No,"Fact of women dominating social media is not surprising to me, but the growing male and female visuals are very effective."
Delivery,So women are more social - no news there - though it comes across as a new finding.
No,maintaining a logical flow of information - introducing interesting questions that necessitate answer
No,again very engaging visuals
No,again very engaging visuals
Delivery,Her movement around is a bit annoying. Would I have noticed it if others hadn't commented on it?
Delivery,I'm not sure anymore whether I'm commenting on the content or the presentation as such... anyway I don't find her conclusions or choice of words too convincing.
No,"the talk has not a real structure, but tells an interesting story, rethorically challenging what she takes to be what is taken for granted"
No,"missing a bit of structure, feels like it's not building up to anything exciting, not sure where she's going and therefore easier for audience to disengage"
Delivery,"Yes, the speaker is easy to follow and speaks clearly. She seems poised and confident."
No,use of authentic photos makes presentation even more realistic
No,There is obvious a clear story line.
No,"again, too many visuals are distracting"
No,focus on diversity as well
Delivery,Message is clear but too many words to deliver it. A take home-message for me is that it helps having a social engaging topic.
Delivery,The topic is interesting but the information the speaker was presenting was not very engaging.
Delivery,Actually I think here is too much sway and pace.
Delivery,doesn't sound too excited about her job/research (compared with Steve Jobs)
Delivery,"I am not quite joining the dots yet, although that may be my lack of focus. The most memorable point so far has been via Madmen and the idea of psychographics which aren't been used much, advertisers and media still just use demographics. It is hard to imagine what the changes she suggests might look like, although I liked the challenge to terms like 'chick flicks', which I hate!"
Delivery,"very good of body language, posture and gesture ... facial expression also indicates interest and enthusiasm about the work presented"
Delivery,closing with imagining a future scenario is a good move
No,"To me, this is an excellent example of how visual aids help to convey the ideas. All the images complemented and reinforced the arguments the presenter was giving.////Maybe using magazine front pages is not such a good idea because they might be too strong and the minds of the people in the audience could get carried away, but if they are used for a short while, that might not be a problem."
Delivery,The ending was not strong.  Although she did use a rhetorical question as means to highlight her point. I don't think she built a strong case for why women will drive the change.
No,"Pro: very self confident, well prepared talk, trying to engange audiance by holding eye contact to individuals and walking on the stage (can be negative as well if its so much walking though),using examples everyone can relate to//Negative: dont like slides, too much going on, no clear pattern"
No,"ending bit abrupt, no clear take home message"
No,thanking the audience for their attention
No,"Good narrative structure, tied in with the closing statement ""I can't wait to see what it looks like"" which was upbeat and engaging."
Delivery,speech was very clear and at a good pace all the way through
Delivery,the powerful speech helps the audience understand about the presentation
No,"Great talk overall, driven by a brilliant idea."
No,Great structure
Delivery,"Link between statistics from speaker's claims were not well established. The speech lacked authority, and was mainly based on the speaker's own assumptions. The figures in the chart did not visibly coincide with the speaker's first few claims, as she gave different percentages that were not exactly the same as what was shown on screen, which was likely to confuse the audience. Figures should be exact; otherwise, audience will have to do some mental computation and be distracted."
Delivery,She did pace a lot though.
No,"Rushed intro so the impact is less. He appears very nervous and is speaking too quickly.//Good opening slides are very clear. //It is unclear the purpose of the talk, the broad content is clear.//Even at 3 minutes the speed is talking at is too fast and means it feels rushed. Either he needs to reduce the amount he is trying to say and speak slower.//Scanning the audience too quickly.//I am unclear of the surveillance point, perhaps because I am trying to analyse the presentation skills?//His high point was revealed at he 6 minute mark. It would have been good to show the direction he was heading from the beginning."
Delivery,"The topic itself is enticing, but his usage of numbers is very poignant. The visuals are simple but to the point. To be honest his lisp is distracting, which is a question i ask myself if you do have a lisp, or use fillers alot, does this harm your presentation? Lastly, i liked the ending, which is asking you to be an active participant."
Delivery,Not a very efficient intro - disengaging sound
Delivery,"good start, historical fact"
Delivery,Good strong opening.
No,The animation on picture helps to understand the content.
Delivery,fast speech and long pauses in between short bursts made it hard for me to hear and follow properly at first
Delivery,He speaks quite quickly which is a bit unclear sometimes.
No,"I can occasionally pick up some words like web surveillance, lost of privacy on the web... But I'm not following the whole talk and I'm not sure what's the objective of this talk."
No,opens presentation with a question - good way to raise expectation and engage the audience
No,Great to begin with a question I think - but could have come immediately at the beginning?
Delivery,"Opening statements not very engaging - let's talk about something doesn't really communicate why we should care, neither does how old it is."
Delivery,"goes quite quickly, 'uh' instead of just pause between words, comes across as possibly nervous or energetic/excited"
Delivery,he speaks a bit too fast and looks very nervous
Delivery,"His was delivering the idea clearly, but it kind of he felt unconfident to talk to the audience."
Delivery,"the speaker talks to fast...however, the opening and closing was great. the presentation techniques was good with less text and more pictures."
No,Nice visual
Delivery,Enthusiasm and storyteller which is good.
Delivery,Nice simple graphics
No,interesting visual aids...good illustration of the points raised
No,"nice intro story, can relate to it, the numbers/pictures help make the point"
No,Nice build up and storytelling
Delivery,Interesting introduction
Delivery,"He is a dynamic speaker because he is varying his speech. I heard fast, slow, louder and softer tones."
No,Nice simple graphics
No,Simple slides with visual aids
No,having statistics on slides as he talks about them makes them much clearer and easier to absorb
Delivery,"Pace is uneven and his speech lacks fluidity, doesn't communicate confidence at all well."
Delivery,"moves a bit, one leg to other, gestures - again can come across as nervous or excited"
Delivery,"really too fast, difficult to follow"
Delivery,pace is sometimes too fast...

No,He was showing the number effectively and clearly.
No,the slides so far are a bit boring

No,The key points of his talk were not defined
No,"Charts colors graphs transitions are on point, I really like them"
Delivery,information overload...might be hard for the audience to follow and digest
No,It's not really clear why he's listing visible and invisible features of the www at this point.
Delivery,"I feel that he tries to talk to the audience as if in a one-on-one conversation so that helps engage listeners, but sometimes he is difficult to understand."
Delivery,He actually seems quite nervous. I guess this endearing from a high profile person although a little bit distracting due to slightly jumpy mannerisms and quick speech.
Delivery,He is talking quite fast I think.
Delivery,Some habits like emmm and some meaningless behavior
Delivery,he's looking around without looking in the eyes of anybody
Delivery,Change of tone and pacing helps you focus on the important parts of his talk
No,"structure is a bit missing,not very clear where he's going"
Delivery,"makes me nervous, talks fast, moves fast...a few more gaps between point would give the audiance time to think and to follow up what he is actually talking about"
No,"The visuals aids are okay, but they're mostly just repeating what he is saying. Sort of boring."
No,"maybe this kind of talk would have benfited of a short outline, it's difficult to understand why he's giving this information"
No,"going through some pros and cons was good, but it would have been helpful if he had clearly introduced that he was going to do this instead of just starting to go through them"
Delivery,"Speaker seems very engaged, like the combination of delivery and visuals (which add to rather than detract from  his speech)."
Delivery,Very useful presentation to see exactly the right way to present.
Delivery,uses body language (kinesics)... though a bit abrupt and disorienting
Delivery,no prolonged eye contact with audience
Delivery,too much body movement this might cause distraction or confusion
Delivery,He grabs my attention with his tone variations and movements
No,I don't see a structure. Although the presentation is very good a structure would made me follow his story.
No,"Uses key words as bullets and key points (e.g., privacy, censorship); building the case that the web has had enormous positive influence; but it is not free from risk."
No,The slides and their headlines sum up the key issues for the web today.
No,"Visuals are quite attractive with a consistent style and colour scheme, but very static."
No,I'm honestly not sure what to say about structure. I am not wowed.
No,"like the graphics, simple, not overpowering/distracting from speech"
Delivery,He seems to be rushing a bit. But thats probably because he only has 5 mins to give this talk
Delivery,Goes a bit too fast sometimes.
No,The last two visual aids were more interesting (filter bubble and one before that).
No,"Some of the jargon confuses me, no definitions?"
No,providing examples to illustrate the point raised
Delivery,I like how he uses 'I want a web where' rather than assuming we'll all want the same thing.
No,Due to the fast speech its a bit hard to follow the structure of the talk
No,"making points clear by listing them (""i want..."")...and inviting audiance to make their own"

Delivery,Clear call to action about putting together a bill of rights.
No,Not so impressed with the visuals considering who he is...
No,"asking audience to engage, participate"
No,I kind of wish he introduced the Magna Carta concept before the very end of the talk.
Delivery,the closing part is boring
No,Structure ends on a clear and reiterated call to action.
Delivery,"Engagement, future-directed points delivered with good emphasis towards the end."
No,A constitution for the web would be almost impossible to enforce surely?
Delivery,"He is passionate about his ideas.  He has the right to be proud as his creation has changed the world. Though it is not possible to engage the audience in this type of setting, he manages to do this by asking for their input, to an extremely important global issue, by providing the forum for feedback."
Delivery,I think visual aids are understandable and clear. The contents are engaging but he speaks a little fast.
No,Memorable ending
Delivery,"He added the ""one more thing"" as Steve Jobs does: ""oh, and will you do me a favor, fight for it for me."""
No,thanking the audience for their attention
Delivery,A little bit strange ending?
No,"Not really very impressed, visuals not great, they looked like clip art, ideas to rambling, not enough detail. He sounded distracted as if he would rather not be there."
No,"Kind of ""one more thing"" there..."
Delivery,"Pithy closing statement, but undercut by making it about himself."
No,very strong and clear opening and ending!
Delivery,"Although it is Tim Berners Lee, he is not such a good speaker.  He was like talking to another person, not to a whole audience. He spoke too fast and at times he seemed as if he had forgotten what he wanted to say. //The topic was interesting and the visual aids were adequate, that is why one keeps attentive.//I guess this is an example of how if one is not a natural good speaker, some features of good presentations can cover some deficiencies."
Delivery,at the beginning found the delivery a little jumpy but followed it better as got further in.
No,"She makes us try and imagine, thus using a strong visual, whilst explaining the story. She hasnt used the 5 secrets much."
No,"Great clear introduction.//Lovely voice delivery, easy to listen to, lovely tone and nicely paced speed.//I agree the intro was delivered in a great manner.//It may have helped to have more slides that focus in on greater details. Initially she had good use of hand signals, that were appropriate. This became repetitive and over used later in the speech"
No,delivery and visual
Delivery,Delivery using good gesture
No,introducing self and focus of work
Delivery,the presentation was well organised. she used hand gesture through the presentation.
Delivery,"Now that I'm aware she only has 3 minutes, it seemed a waste of time to reiterate the title of her speech."
No,nice body position and hand gestures. Starting the presentation with introducing herself and explaining the problem (state of art in her reasearch area and whats new). Involving the audiance by creating pictures and guiding them through her presentation slide
Delivery,"She has very strong, slow voice and that makes her very confident. She also uses some gestures to express herself."
No,gives a background of the work ... sets the context of her own research
Delivery,"good introduction, right to the point"
No,Good although many colours and the font make the presentation unprofessional
Delivery,Good but typical start

Delivery,Not the most engaging beginning (relating to the previous tutorial videos) - especially not for the non-medical audience.
No,"She used jargon in the beginning, that is distracting"
No,"bit of a standard start, reading out the exact title of the presentation and the introduction story stays general, no numbers, nothing to draw in the audience more"

No,explained the diagram on her slides well
Delivery,"hands stay high, don't relax//she moves around quite a bit"
No,"in this kind of talk, an outline would have been useful to understand the overall idea"
No,it might be better to explain the term hypoxia when initially introduced or state that this is going to be clear soon enough in the presentation
Delivery,she explains a complicated problem quite clearly
No,One visual enables her to explain clearly how treatment works.
No,"slide isn't bad, bit busy, but it doesn't tell the story on it's own, she needs to explain it for it to make sense"
Delivery,The dilivary is great. It's calm and collected
Delivery,"For those without a strong biology background, the description of and visuals are necessary and helpful; as are the use of hand movements and varying tone of voice."

Delivery,I think her pace and tone are good

No,"Narrative structure, presenting the mechanisms as a story."
Delivery,Oops focus of my work is on working
No,"she only gets to the focus of her work in the last half a minute (or less), it lacks a story with a build up"
No,good explanation of unfamiliar unknown terms
Delivery,appropriate pause and silence
Delivery,No pauses and speaking too fast without enthusiasm
Delivery,"good closing part, higlighting main idea"
Delivery,No strong opening and no strong closing.
Delivery,CLosing statement was a big technical compared to the clear and simple language used in most of the presentation.
No,uses technical terms for the conclusion which makes it less memorable for non-experts in the room to take home
No,thanking the audience for their attention
No,"Passionate about her work.  Provide clear understanding of what her work involves and, to a lesser degree, the impact of the work.

Delivery,Great ending with confident smile and good stance.
No,clear finish
Delivery,She delivered the presentation with a clear tone and voice. //She used good gestures and visual aids.//Excellent example of presentation.

Delivery,Wow. Very engaging; I almost forgot to comment because she was so interesting.
No,"Interesting topic, but it left a lot of unanswered questions and being so literal, it just was not that inspiring."
No,strong and sharp end. lots of scientific words not everyone will understand but depends on audiance. would have liked an outlook. whats her next step?
No,it was a clear informative talk. She spend most of her time talking abut the background of her work and then briefly mentioned what she does. I wonder if it should have been the other way around.
Delivery,Explanation was clear and succinct.
Delivery,Very nice tone of her voice and gestures. It was a very clear presentation
No,It seems  to me that the strong point in this presentation is structure. It is a sound presentation with a good beginning and a good concluding part where the speaker states the objective of her research project and  remarks its importance.
