TmbQFWBvTtY1,0,0.22,  When we stand and present we want to come across a confident and composed .
TmbQFWBvTtY1,,,  And one of the great way to do that is by working on our body language . Let 's
TmbQFWBvTtY1,,,  look at three way to improve your nonverbal body language in presentation .
TmbQFWBvTtY1,,,  Coming up .
TmbQFWBvTtY1,,,  Hello again friend . If you never seen one of my video I 'm Alex Lyon .
TmbQFWBvTtY1,,,  And this channel Communication Coach is here to help you increase
TmbQFWBvTtY2,0.25,0.43,  your impact so you can lead your team to higher level of excellence . And I
TmbQFWBvTtY2,,,  believe that presentation skill are a really important part of leadership .
TmbQFWBvTtY2,,,  You 're going to be standing and presenting quite frequently if you 're in
TmbQFWBvTtY2,,,  any kind of leadership position . So we want to get just a little bit better at
TmbQFWBvTtY2,,,  this . Let 's look at three way you can improve your nonverbal body language so
TmbQFWBvTtY2,,,  that people can hear your message in a much more confident and composed way .
TmbQFWBvTtY3,0.47,1.08,  And these tip by the way go together . So each of the three tip have a couple of
TmbQFWBvTtY3,,,  piece a you 'll see . So the first tip is eye contact and smile . So eye contact .
TmbQFWBvTtY3,,,  You have to look directly into somebody 's eye that 's listening about
TmbQFWBvTtY3,,,  99 % of the time . You do n't want to look too much at your note . You do n't want to
TmbQFWBvTtY3,,,  look back at your slide really . You certainly do n't want to look at the
TmbQFWBvTtY3,,,  floor over their head . A lot of bad habit out there in term of eye contact .
TmbQFWBvTtY4,1.13,1.32,  You want to look directly in someone 's eye almost the whole time and that
TmbQFWBvTtY4,,,  really take quite a bit of practice . The other thing you want to do is look
TmbQFWBvTtY4,,,  directly into somebody 's eye long enough to finish a thought and then move
TmbQFWBvTtY4,,,  on to the next person . So you do n't want to just stare at one person the whole
TmbQFWBvTtY4,,,  time and you do n't want to scan so that you 're never locking in . A communication
TmbQFWBvTtY4,,,  coach actually once told me `` One thought one look . '' So long enough to finish about
TmbQFWBvTtY5,1.36,1.58,  a sentence feel that connection and then you move on to the next person . So what
TmbQFWBvTtY5,,,  do you do with your face while you 're making eye contact . You 've got to
TmbQFWBvTtY5,,,  smile . A lot of time people get overly robotic when they present . They might be
TmbQFWBvTtY5,,,  making good eye contact but their face is stern . And it doe n't look like
TmbQFWBvTtY5,,,  anything 's happening emotionally . You want to smile and warm your face up a
TmbQFWBvTtY5,,,  little bit so that when you 're making eye contact with somebody they feel a
TmbQFWBvTtY6,2.02,2.23,  connection with you that 's welcoming and supportive . You do n't want to come across
TmbQFWBvTtY6,,,  a a deer in the headlight . Tip number two . Posture and gesture . And these
TmbQFWBvTtY6,,,  thing go together . So in term of what not to do for posture you do n't
TmbQFWBvTtY6,,,  want to shuffle your foot back and forth . You do n't want to sway your hip . You
TmbQFWBvTtY6,,,  do n't want to cross and uncross your leg repetitively . You do n't want to pace
TmbQFWBvTtY6,,,  around like a wild person . By the way if you want to walk in a presentation it 's
TmbQFWBvTtY7,2.27,2.48,  okay to walk a little bit but make sure when you walk you stop and you say a
TmbQFWBvTtY7,,,  little bit before you walk again . So walk with a purpose
TmbQFWBvTtY7,,,  stop share your message and then maybe a minute or so later walk again . Do n't pace .
TmbQFWBvTtY7,,,  So once you have these don'ts out of the way what should you do ? You want to stand
TmbQFWBvTtY7,,,  with your foot about shoulder width apart . This is how you would stand if you
TmbQFWBvTtY7,,,  were n't self about how you 're standing . We get self when we
TmbQFWBvTtY8,2.51,3.12,  present but really all you have to do is stand like a normal person . Then you want
TmbQFWBvTtY8,,,  to put just a tiny bit of weight on the front of your foot and a little tiny bit
TmbQFWBvTtY8,,,  lighter on your heel . And your whole foot is still touching but you have a
TmbQFWBvTtY8,,,  little bit more of a ready responsive position . You also want to soften your
TmbQFWBvTtY8,,,  knee a little bit . You do n't want to have locked knee . Bad thing happen when
TmbQFWBvTtY8,,,  your lock your knee . I 'm not sure of the physiology of it but when people lock
TmbQFWBvTtY9,3.16,3.34,  their knee they oftentimes pas out when they 're nervous . And you do n't want
TmbQFWBvTtY9,,,  to do that in the middle of your presentation . So soften those knee . Now
TmbQFWBvTtY9,,,  you 've got your posture . Let 's add some gesture to it . You do n't want to put
TmbQFWBvTtY9,,,  your hand in your pocket . You do n't want to put your hand behind your back .
TmbQFWBvTtY9,,,  You do n't want to grab on to different part of your body for security . All that
TmbQFWBvTtY9,,,  look very distracting . So here 's what you should do . You should loosely clasp
TmbQFWBvTtY10,3.39,3.58,  your hand at about belt level . And then you should just gesture naturally from
TmbQFWBvTtY10,,,  there . You do n't want to interlock your finger you do n't want to wring your
TmbQFWBvTtY10,,,  hand . Because then you 'll get too locked in and it 's hard to let go . But if you
TmbQFWBvTtY10,,,  practice at home just loosely clasping your hand like this then just start to
TmbQFWBvTtY10,,,  gesture naturally from here and that 's the way to do it . Small little gesture
TmbQFWBvTtY10,,,  just like this . You can do this all day long and it 's just going to add a nice
TmbQFWBvTtY11,4.02,4.24,  emphasis to your word and it 's not going to be distracting whatsoever .
TmbQFWBvTtY11,,,  Tip number three . You want to pause . And when you pause after a key idea add a little
TmbQFWBvTtY11,,,  tiny bit of a nod . I 've seen some really convincing and persuasive speaker do
TmbQFWBvTtY11,,,  this . And what you 'll notice if you pause after a key idea and nod that pause is
TmbQFWBvTtY11,,,  really persuasive but the nodding is contagious . You 'll see that people
TmbQFWBvTtY11,,,  listening to you actually start to nod a little bit with you . And
TmbQFWBvTtY12,4.27,4.47,  that 's one of the way that you know you have them . It 's a very subtle but
TmbQFWBvTtY12,,,  powerful nonverbal body language tip . So those are my three tip for improving
TmbQFWBvTtY12,,,  your nonverbal body language when you 're presenting . But I 'd like to hear your
TmbQFWBvTtY12,,,  tip . Question of the day how do you recommend that we improve our body
TmbQFWBvTtY12,,,  language while we 're presenting . Please put the comment below in that section . I
TmbQFWBvTtY12,,,  look forward to reading those . So thanks . God bless . I 'll see you in the next video .
1VCaJ4dSHak1,0.01,0.28,  Using gesture when give a public speech is a very important part of your presentation .
1VCaJ4dSHak1,,,  If you fail to use gesture properly and you do awkward gesture throughout your presentation
1VCaJ4dSHak1,,,  you are probably going to distract your audience and you are not going to get the impact that
1VCaJ4dSHak1,,,  you want when you presenting .
1VCaJ4dSHak1,,,  So what are four gesture that we use and how can we use them and use them effectively
1VCaJ4dSHak1,,,  during our presentation ?
1VCaJ4dSHak2,0.29,0.54,  Hi I am Ryan McLean and I am from publicspeakingpower.com where we teach people like you how to become
1VCaJ4dSHak2,,,  powerful public speaker .
1VCaJ4dSHak2,,,  So I am going to walk you through the four gesture that you can use in your presentation
1VCaJ4dSHak2,,,  and so you can become more powerful and effective public speaker .
1VCaJ4dSHak2,,,  Gesture number one are descriptive Gestures so these are gesture that we are using to
1VCaJ4dSHak2,,,  describe something or situation .We might draw comparison between something thatâ€™s
1VCaJ4dSHak3,1,1.22,  really big and something thatâ€™s really small or we might use it to contrast certain item
1VCaJ4dSHak3,,,  or to depict the size .
1VCaJ4dSHak3,,,  A great example that I am taking from toy master is if you are using a metaphor something
1VCaJ4dSHak3,,,  is like a tiny little bird and you are holding like cup stand stating the metaphor of the
1VCaJ4dSHak3,,,  bird and also implying size being small .
1VCaJ4dSHak3,,,  You can also use descriptive gesture to say shape say it wa the box this big back
1VCaJ4dSHak4,1.31,1.53,  these and you showing square shape of the box using your gesture .
1VCaJ4dSHak4,,,  You can also talk about movement so moving from here to there picking up a box you
1VCaJ4dSHak4,,,  can talk about location the table wa over here and there wa magazine on the table and
1VCaJ4dSHak4,,,  you can even talk about the number like I said four different gesture that we are going
1VCaJ4dSHak4,,,  to use .
1VCaJ4dSHak4,,,  So descriptive gesture are very helpful because when we are speaking all we have is our word
1VCaJ4dSHak5,1.59,2.25,  all we have is what come out of our mouth and by using descriptive gesture we can
1VCaJ4dSHak5,,,  actually improve the impact and improve the comprehension of our audience so that our
1VCaJ4dSHak5,,,  message get across more effectively .
1VCaJ4dSHak5,,,  Number two is Emphatic gesture that a confusing word so let me explain it .
1VCaJ4dSHak5,,,  Emphatic gesture are like emotional gesture so if we are sad we could slump down and talk
1VCaJ4dSHak5,,,  about thing sad and we are angry we could put our fist together and make angry face .
1VCaJ4dSHak6,2.3,2.59,  So we can use these gesture to symbolise the feeling that we have and that also emphatic
1VCaJ4dSHak6,,,  gesture help u in more genuine â€˜so what are you talking about I am so angry when
1VCaJ4dSHak6,,,  this happened and we are using this angry gesture it actually give more humph to our
1VCaJ4dSHak6,,,  presentation and make sing more genuine yes he were angry I can see his body language
1VCaJ4dSHak6,,,  he wa angryâ€™ but if you were saying â€˜Yeah I wa really angryâ€™ and your body language
1VCaJ4dSHak6,,,  is just slumped and you kind of look depressed well may be they are not going to believe
1VCaJ4dSHak7,3.03,3.23,  that you are actually angry .
1VCaJ4dSHak7,,,  So actually it give make your presentation look more genuine .
1VCaJ4dSHak7,,,  Number three a Suggestive gesture so these are the thing like mood an expression
1VCaJ4dSHak7,,,  for example : you could say I welcome you in with open arm since you got your open palm
1VCaJ4dSHak7,,,  symbolises that you are open .
1VCaJ4dSHak7,,,  So you could say that this guy in audience who wa just wonâ€™t listen to anything else
1VCaJ4dSHak8,3.29,3.53,  or saying he just NO and you are crossing your arm and you kind of you are suggesting
1VCaJ4dSHak8,,,  that even though he may be crossing his arm he wa closed off that wa the vibe that
1VCaJ4dSHak8,,,  he wa giving off the emotion that he wa giving off .
1VCaJ4dSHak8,,,  You could do lot of other thing like striking your shoulder you know NAHH !
1VCaJ4dSHak8,,,  Who care or you could also you know even show your back and when there you just dint
1VCaJ4dSHak8,,,  care about I wa talking about .
1VCaJ4dSHak9,3.56,4.16,  Last one number four is Prompting Gestures ; So these are the one that prompt the audience
1VCaJ4dSHak9,,,  to do something so what I am going to take Tony Robbins doe this really well he might
1VCaJ4dSHak9,,,  say raise your hand if you want to earn million dollar this year .
1VCaJ4dSHak9,,,  And so I am raising my hand a I am telling people to raise their hand hence they are
1VCaJ4dSHak9,,,  more likely to do it .
1VCaJ4dSHak9,,,  Or you could say let get warmed up everyone let s jump up and down on the spot .
1VCaJ4dSHak10,4.22,4.44,  So you can see in the video I am jumping and so it encourages audience or prompt them
1VCaJ4dSHak10,,,  to do something that you want to do .
1VCaJ4dSHak10,,,  So they have the four gesture which we can use while giving a presentation and there
1VCaJ4dSHak10,,,  are some idea on how you can use them .
1VCaJ4dSHak10,,,  When it come down to using them effectively I am going to create an entirely other video
1VCaJ4dSHak10,,,  and podcast .
1VCaJ4dSHak11,4.46,5.1,  About that I have got five tip on you can use them more effectively but really it come
1VCaJ4dSHak11,,,  down to preparation and practice and being natural in your gesture .
1VCaJ4dSHak11,,,  Donâ€™t try and feel force and you donâ€™t feel natural then donâ€™t do it .
1VCaJ4dSHak11,,,  If it is flowing like it doe in conversation everyday conversation with your friend
1VCaJ4dSHak11,,,  with your family with your colleague then thatâ€™s the good sign that theyâ€™re going
1VCaJ4dSHak11,,,  to be hand gesture that will work .
1VCaJ4dSHak13,5.13,5.54,  And also you just you want to avoid those hand gesture that just really take away from
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  your presentation and donâ€™t support what you are presenting .
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  So I guess the rule is gesture are supporting what you are saying and then they are probably
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  going to be great .
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  If it take you away from what you are saying like scratching your face adjusting clothes
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  playing with your ring figure than probably they will take you away from the presentation
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  and you donâ€™t want to use them .
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  For more video audio and article just like this one you can get them on blog hit over
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  the publicspeckingpower.com and I will see you in next episode where we talk about the
1VCaJ4dSHak13,,,  five tip for better public speaking gesture .
h6sm47j-Am41,0,0.17,   I have often heard professional speaker say
h6sm47j-Am41,,,  you should start your presentation with a joke .
h6sm47j-Am41,,,  That attention grabber is critical
h6sm47j-Am41,,,  and I wan na disagree with this advice .
h6sm47j-Am41,,,  I do not recommend telling a setup punchline joke
h6sm47j-Am41,,,  the kind that a stand comic would tell
h6sm47j-Am42,0.2,0.34,  and there are a lotta reason why .
h6sm47j-Am42,,,  Now at the same time I am 100 % in favor
h6sm47j-Am42,,,  of using lighthearted humor in a presentation
h6sm47j-Am42,,,  and I do it often when I do professional presentation
h6sm47j-Am42,,,  and when I teach in college .
h6sm47j-Am42,,,  So there are some difference here
h6sm47j-Am43,0.35,0.5,  but I can give you a really straight ahead way
h6sm47j-Am43,,,  to add humor without the big risk of a punchline joke .
h6sm47j-Am43,,,  So let 's take a look .
h6sm47j-Am43,,,  ( light music )
h6sm47j-Am43,,,  Hi I 'm Alex Lyon and this is Communication Coach .
h6sm47j-Am43,,,  We 're here to help you increase your impact
h6sm47j-Am44,0.52,1.09,  and lead your team to higher level of excellence .
h6sm47j-Am44,,,  Lotta bad advice out there in my humble opinion
h6sm47j-Am44,,,  about telling joke a attention grabber .
h6sm47j-Am44,,,  Here is the most common situation that I have seen .
h6sm47j-Am44,,,  The speaker try to start off with a joke
h6sm47j-Am44,,,  that they have created and then nobody laugh .
h6sm47j-Am45,1.12,1.26,  And then instead of just moving on
h6sm47j-Am45,,,  they start chuckling nervously to cue people
h6sm47j-Am45,,,  that that wa a joke .
h6sm47j-Am45,,,  The audience may or may not chuckle nervously
h6sm47j-Am45,,,  and it 's an incredibly awkward situation .
h6sm47j-Am45,,,  Now think about this this is the first moment
h6sm47j-Am46,1.28,1.46,  of your presentation and you completely bombed
h6sm47j-Am46,,,  and there are nothing but cricket and nervous laughter .
h6sm47j-Am46,,,  This is not the way you want to start a presentation .
h6sm47j-Am46,,,  It 's really high risk and really low reward .
h6sm47j-Am46,,,  So I am against these stand comic setup
h6sm47j-Am46,,,  and punchline one joke .
h6sm47j-Am47,1.48,2.02,  Now having said that I 'm gon na sound
h6sm47j-Am47,,,  like I 'm contradicting myself but I am not .
h6sm47j-Am47,,,  There 's a lot of way to add humor
h6sm47j-Am47,,,  to your attention grabber without the big risk .
h6sm47j-Am47,,,  So let 's look at three easy way to add
h6sm47j-Am47,,,  some lighthearted humor and still grab
h6sm47j-Am48,2.05,2.19,  your audience 's attention .
h6sm47j-Am48,,,  The first way is to deliberately quote
h6sm47j-Am48,,,  someone else that 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am48,,,  Now by quoting them directly by saying a Jerry Seinfeld
h6sm47j-Am48,,,  once said or a George Burns once said
h6sm47j-Am48,,,  then you may even have the piece of paper in your hand
h6sm47j-Am49,2.22,2.34,  and read the quotation .
h6sm47j-Am49,,,  What you 're doing there is you 're drawing
h6sm47j-Am49,,,  people 's attention to what that other person said
h6sm47j-Am49,,,  and it take the attention off of you a the joke teller .
h6sm47j-Am49,,,  So you know they have a funny line that kill .
h6sm47j-Am49,,,  It 's already been tested .
h6sm47j-Am410,2.36,2.47,  They 're stand comic they probably worked on it
h6sm47j-Am410,,,  for year to get it just right .
h6sm47j-Am410,,,  And now you 're both you and your audience
h6sm47j-Am410,,,  focusing on that little line
h6sm47j-Am410,,,  that little humor a an object that you 're both looking at .
h6sm47j-Am410,,,  So the attention 's not on you .
h6sm47j-Am411,2.48,2.56,  And if it bomb which they usually do n't
h6sm47j-Am411,,,  because if they 're funny they 're funny
h6sm47j-Am411,,,  because it 's already been worked out
h6sm47j-Am411,,,  then what you do is you get a little chuckle
h6sm47j-Am411,,,  you get a little laugh .
h6sm47j-Am411,,,  But if it bomb then it 's not really on you .
h6sm47j-Am412,2.59,3.09,  It 's on George Burns it 's on Jerry Seinfeld .
h6sm47j-Am412,,,  I wa saying to my wife the other day
h6sm47j-Am412,,,  you know Jerry Seinfeld said in his bit
h6sm47j-Am412,,,  `` My parent just moved to Florida .
h6sm47j-Am412,,,  `` Now they did n't wan na move to Florida
h6sm47j-Am412,,,  `` but they 're 65 and that 's the law . ''
h6sm47j-Am413,3.12,3.23,  And my wife laughed huge .
h6sm47j-Am413,,,  I 'm always trying to make my wife laugh
h6sm47j-Am413,,,  but she laugh when I tell Jerry Seinfeld joke
h6sm47j-Am413,,,  and I think it 's because you can hear the comedian
h6sm47j-Am413,,,  telling the joke in your mind a the person share it
h6sm47j-Am413,,,  and it transport you a little bit more
h6sm47j-Am414,3.25,3.34,  than hearing me Alex Lyon a the speaker
h6sm47j-Am414,,,  tell my one joke .
h6sm47j-Am414,,,  So quote someone else that 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am414,,,  Use a quotation .
h6sm47j-Am414,,,  That 's a great attention grabber no problem .
h6sm47j-Am414,,,  The other way you can add humor is by telling
h6sm47j-Am415,3.36,3.47,  a lighthearted story .
h6sm47j-Am415,,,  And the way to make a story lighthearted
h6sm47j-Am415,,,  and by the way I have a whole nother video
h6sm47j-Am415,,,  on how to tell story a attention grabber
h6sm47j-Am415,,,  I 'll put that link in the description below
h6sm47j-Am415,,,  is you add a little bit of a goal to the person
h6sm47j-Am416,3.5,4.01,  in the story .
h6sm47j-Am416,,,  They 're trying to reach a destination
h6sm47j-Am416,,,  achieve something and that way your story get humorous
h6sm47j-Am416,,,  because the obstacle along the way prevent them
h6sm47j-Am416,,,  from reaching that goal and it becomes
h6sm47j-Am416,,,  pretty lighthearted pretty funny .
h6sm47j-Am417,4.02,4.16,  That 's the whole reason why a movie like Dumb and Dumber
h6sm47j-Am417,,,  is funny because it 's a road trip movie
h6sm47j-Am417,,,  where these two guy are trying to get from A to B
h6sm47j-Am417,,,  from Providence to Aspen to see about a girl
h6sm47j-Am417,,,  and everything that can go wrong doe go wrong
h6sm47j-Am417,,,  on their way .
h6sm47j-Am418,4.16,4.27,  And so all these mishap become very humorous
h6sm47j-Am418,,,  because you know there 's a goal in mind
h6sm47j-Am418,,,  that is preventing and they 're being prevented
h6sm47j-Am418,,,  from getting there .
h6sm47j-Am418,,,  So adding a little bit of a humorous goal
h6sm47j-Am418,,,  to your story can make that story more lighthearted .
h6sm47j-Am419,4.3,4.39,  So you can tell a story .
h6sm47j-Am419,,,  It 's not a punchline but it add just a little bit
h6sm47j-Am419,,,  of a chuckle a little bit of a smile
h6sm47j-Am419,,,  to your audience 's experience .
h6sm47j-Am419,,,  And the third way is really easy
h6sm47j-Am419,,,  and that is to show something visual
h6sm47j-Am420,4.41,4.52,  on the screen that you know is funny .
h6sm47j-Am420,,,  So maybe there 's a cute picture
h6sm47j-Am420,,,  maybe there 's a little bit of a joke even on the slide
h6sm47j-Am420,,,  and you do n't have to tell it .
h6sm47j-Am420,,,  You just have to say something and then show the image
h6sm47j-Am420,,,  and people chuckle .
h6sm47j-Am421,4.53,5.04,  You 've probably seen speaker use humor this way .
h6sm47j-Am421,,,  It 's a very low way because when you were looking
h6sm47j-Am421,,,  at the internet or doing your reading
h6sm47j-Am421,,,  you came across it and you laughed
h6sm47j-Am421,,,  or somebody forward it to you and you laughed .
h6sm47j-Am421,,,  Everybody think it 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am422,5.05,5.19,  Everyone know it 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am422,,,  And so you share it in a presentation and it 's almost
h6sm47j-Am422,,,  guaranteed to get a smile .
h6sm47j-Am422,,,  So I am 100 % telling your own setup
h6sm47j-Am422,,,  punchline joke but I am also 100 % in favor
h6sm47j-Am422,,,  of using lighthearted humor and these are three
h6sm47j-Am423,5.22,5.35,  low way to do it without worrying
h6sm47j-Am423,,,  about nobody laughing
h6sm47j-Am423,,,  and just hearing those cricket chirping .
h6sm47j-Am423,,,  That 's a really hard way to start a presentation .
h6sm47j-Am423,,,  And trust me I 've seen a lotta people crash and burn
h6sm47j-Am423,,,  and they just completely fall apart
h6sm47j-Am425,5.37,5.54,  because they 're trying to do it that way .
h6sm47j-Am425,,,  So question of the day what are your suggestion
h6sm47j-Am425,,,  for adding humor but not joke to your attention grabber
h6sm47j-Am425,,,  in your presentation ?
h6sm47j-Am425,,,  I would love to hear your comment and your question
h6sm47j-Am425,,,  in that section below .
h6sm47j-Am425,,,  So thanks god bless and I hope you grab
h6sm47j-Am425,,,  your audience 's attention really well

dEDcc0aCjaA1,0.01,0.14,  `` Hi I 'm Jason Teteak .
dEDcc0aCjaA1,,,  I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentation
dEDcc0aCjaA1,,,  and today I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of
dEDcc0aCjaA1,,,  your presentation .
dEDcc0aCjaA1,,,  Here 's how I 'm going to do it . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA1,,,  `` I 'm going to show you 5 step to deliver a killer opener . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA2,0.18,0.38,  If you 're watching this you probably already know that delivering great presentation is
dEDcc0aCjaA2,,,  critical to advance your career but did you know that research say that most adult will
dEDcc0aCjaA2,,,  stop listening to your presentation within the first 10 minute if they are n't convinced
dEDcc0aCjaA2,,,  there 's something in it for them ?
dEDcc0aCjaA2,,,  The problem is that most people do n't know about the skill they need to hook their audience
dEDcc0aCjaA2,,,  give a great presentation and overcome their fear of doing it .
dEDcc0aCjaA3,0.43,0.53,  What am I going to do ?
dEDcc0aCjaA3,,,  Hi Jim .
dEDcc0aCjaA3,,,  How 's it going ?
dEDcc0aCjaA3,,,  I 'm freaking out about this big presentation I have to give tomorrow .
dEDcc0aCjaA3,,,  Well did you write out your opener and practice it three time ?
dEDcc0aCjaA3,,,  No .
dEDcc0aCjaA4,0.54,1.09,  No ?
dEDcc0aCjaA4,,,  Why not ?
dEDcc0aCjaA4,,,  I 'm terrified and I do n't even know where to start .
dEDcc0aCjaA4,,,  Trust me I 've been in that situation before and it 's not fun .
dEDcc0aCjaA4,,,  So to help you out I 'm going to show you my 5 step formula to deliver a killer presentation
dEDcc0aCjaA4,,,  opener every time .
dEDcc0aCjaA5,1.1,1.29,  Let 's start off with step number one which is `` Give a Confident Introduction . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA5,,,  One of the biggest mistake people make when they start their presentation is showing nervousness .
dEDcc0aCjaA5,,,  Here 's the key : It 's not whether you 're nervous it 's whether you show it .
dEDcc0aCjaA5,,,  The first thing you need to do is stand STILL .
dEDcc0aCjaA5,,,  Do n't move .
dEDcc0aCjaA5,,,  Do n't pace and keep your hand at your side .
dEDcc0aCjaA6,1.33,1.53,  This is the most calm and confident stance on the planet and it handle the number 1
dEDcc0aCjaA6,,,  need of your audience which is to feel safe .
dEDcc0aCjaA6,,,  Now you can introduce yourself and say `` Hi my name is Jason Teteak . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA6,,,  When you do this bring your inflection down at the end to show confidence .
dEDcc0aCjaA6,,,  Instead of : `` Hi my name is Jason Teteak ? ''
dEDcc0aCjaA6,,,  Say : `` Hi my name is Jason Teteak . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA7,1.56,2.13,  See the difference ?
dEDcc0aCjaA7,,,  Now we move on to step 2 which is Give Your Credentials .
dEDcc0aCjaA7,,,  This is where many presenter make the mistake of simply giving their title and year of
dEDcc0aCjaA7,,,  experience .
dEDcc0aCjaA7,,,  They say something like `` I 'm a presentation skill coach and I 've been doing it for 20
dEDcc0aCjaA7,,,  year . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA8,2.14,2.33,  Yet your audience want to know : `` What can you do for me ? ''
dEDcc0aCjaA8,,,  They need to know who you are why you 're the best person to deliver this presentation
dEDcc0aCjaA8,,,  and what you have to offer them .
dEDcc0aCjaA8,,,  For example I might say `` I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver
dEDcc0aCjaA8,,,  amazing presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA8,,,  What would that look like for you ?
dEDcc0aCjaA9,2.35,2.52,  To figure this out you need a short elevator speech .
dEDcc0aCjaA9,,,  It look like this : `` You know how some people have this problem ?
dEDcc0aCjaA9,,,  Well I offer this solution . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA9,,,  The solution you offer is how you help people .
dEDcc0aCjaA9,,,  For me it wa : `` You know how some people have a fear of public speaking and a have
dEDcc0aCjaA9,,,  hard time getting their message across in a presentation ?
dEDcc0aCjaA10,2.55,3.16,  Well I help them overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA10,,,  What 's your credential statement ?
dEDcc0aCjaA10,,,  You 'll be amazed at the effect this ha on your audience .
dEDcc0aCjaA10,,,  Step 3 is to `` Deliver Your Hook . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA10,,,  My hook for this video presentation might look something like this `` I 'm going to show
dEDcc0aCjaA10,,,  you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of your presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA11,3.21,3.35,  When you do this you have to get your audience to `` feel '' something .
dEDcc0aCjaA11,,,  How do you get them to feel ?
dEDcc0aCjaA11,,,  You have 3 choice .
dEDcc0aCjaA11,,,  You can get them to feel more happy more successful or more free .
dEDcc0aCjaA11,,,  Look at my hook .
dEDcc0aCjaA11,,,  I said `` I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of
dEDcc0aCjaA12,3.4,3.57,  your presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA12,,,  When you captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of your presentation you 'll
dEDcc0aCjaA12,,,  feel happier because they are listening to you you 'll feel more successful because you
dEDcc0aCjaA12,,,  look like an expert and you 'll feel more freedom when you spend le time worrying
dEDcc0aCjaA12,,,  about your presentation the night before .
dEDcc0aCjaA12,,,  Here 's the practical for you .
dEDcc0aCjaA13,3.58,4.14,  For your presentation write down the word `` I 'm going to show you ... '' then fill in the
dEDcc0aCjaA13,,,  rest with something that 's going to create more happiness success or freedom for your
dEDcc0aCjaA13,,,  audience .
dEDcc0aCjaA13,,,  Here 's the rule .
dEDcc0aCjaA13,,,  You ca n't tell them WHAT they 're going to get until you 've told them WHY they would
dEDcc0aCjaA13,,,  want it .
dEDcc0aCjaA14,4.15,4.37,  Your hook ha to be something that get them to BELIEVE that they want what you 're going
dEDcc0aCjaA14,,,  to give them .
dEDcc0aCjaA14,,,  Take a moment right now and write down WHY your presentation will make your audience
dEDcc0aCjaA14,,,  more happy successful or free in their life .
dEDcc0aCjaA14,,,  And now we move on to step number 4 which is to `` Introduce Your Agenda . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA14,,,  I recommend you use a PowerPoint for this step and the slide should look something
dEDcc0aCjaA15,4.41,4.56,  like this .
dEDcc0aCjaA15,,,  The purpose of this step is to show your audience the takeaway for your presentation  the
dEDcc0aCjaA15,,,  thing they get to `` take away '' and use tomorrow after listening to your presentation .
dEDcc0aCjaA15,,,  Do n't read the slide .
dEDcc0aCjaA15,,,  They 're adult .
dEDcc0aCjaA15,,,  They can read .
dEDcc0aCjaA16,4.57,5.11,  Instead just give them a moment to read it themselves and introduce your agenda by summarizing
dEDcc0aCjaA16,,,  what you 'll be doing .
dEDcc0aCjaA16,,,  You do this by mentioning the number of takeaway you 'll be giving them and paraphrasing the
dEDcc0aCjaA16,,,  goal of your presentation .
dEDcc0aCjaA16,,,  Here 's what it look like :
dEDcc0aCjaA16,,,  `` I 'm going to show you 5 step to deliver a killer opener . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA17,5.16,5.35,  What would this look like for you ?
dEDcc0aCjaA17,,,  The last step is Step 5 Give a Credible Statement .
dEDcc0aCjaA17,,,  You can do this by giving relevant or compelling data to your audience to support your message .
dEDcc0aCjaA17,,,  Remember how I did this at the beginning of this video ?
dEDcc0aCjaA17,,,  I said `` You probably already know that delivering great presentation is critical to advance
dEDcc0aCjaA17,,,  your career but did you know that research say that most adult will stop listening
dEDcc0aCjaA18,5.4,5.57,  to your presentation within the first 10 minute if they are n't convinced there 's something
dEDcc0aCjaA18,,,  in it for them ? ''
dEDcc0aCjaA18,,,  When you do this within the first 2 minute of your presentation your audience start
dEDcc0aCjaA18,,,  to trust you .
dEDcc0aCjaA18,,,  Without bragging your listener start to think `` oooh this guy know what he 's talking
dEDcc0aCjaA18,,,  about ''
dEDcc0aCjaA19,5.58,6.14,  Done .
dEDcc0aCjaA19,,,  When I put those 5 step together it sound like this :
dEDcc0aCjaA19,,,  `` Hi I 'm Jason Teteak .
dEDcc0aCjaA19,,,  I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentation
dEDcc0aCjaA19,,,  and today I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of
dEDcc0aCjaA19,,,  your presentation .
dEDcc0aCjaA20,6.16,6.34,  Here 's how I 'm going to do it . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA20,,,  `` I 'm going to show you 5 step to deliver a killer opener . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA20,,,  `` You probably already know that delivering great presentation is critical to advance
dEDcc0aCjaA20,,,  your career but did you know that research say that most adult will stop listening
dEDcc0aCjaA20,,,  to your presentation within the first 10 minute if they are n't convinced there 's something
dEDcc0aCjaA20,,,  in it for them ? ''
dEDcc0aCjaA21,6.35,6.53,  Wow !
dEDcc0aCjaA21,,,  Do you see how powerful that is ?
dEDcc0aCjaA21,,,  Those are the 5 step to deliver a killer presentation opener whenever you do a presentation .

dEDcc0aCjaA21,,,  For that reason I put together some free video training for everyone who stayed to

MnIPpUiTcRc1,0.01,0.09,  pay practitioner today I 'm going to be
MnIPpUiTcRc1,,,  teaching you with the help of my friend
MnIPpUiTcRc1,,,  Dana Blouin the top seven tip for a
MnIPpUiTcRc1,,,  great presentation
MnIPpUiTcRc1,,,  Dana blue and a an entrepreneur
MnIPpUiTcRc1,,,  currently living in Bangkok Thailand
MnIPpUiTcRc2,0.12,0.22,  where he is a co and CEO of a
MnIPpUiTcRc2,,,  company called mango lab anyways here 's
MnIPpUiTcRc2,,,  some of his tip we all have to give
MnIPpUiTcRc2,,,  presentation at different point in our
MnIPpUiTcRc2,,,  life that might be for school or work or
MnIPpUiTcRc2,,,  an organization that you were n't
MnIPpUiTcRc3,0.23,0.32,  involved with no matter where we give
MnIPpUiTcRc3,,,  the presentation or to who we want to
MnIPpUiTcRc3,,,  make sure that it ha the impact on the
MnIPpUiTcRc3,,,  audience and that it 's memorable these
MnIPpUiTcRc3,,,  are seven tip that are going to ensure
MnIPpUiTcRc3,,,  that you nail the presentation and leave
MnIPpUiTcRc4,0.34,0.43,  a lasting impression on your audience
MnIPpUiTcRc4,,,  number one know your audience the first
MnIPpUiTcRc4,,,  step in preparing for any presentation
MnIPpUiTcRc4,,,  should be to get a better idea of who
MnIPpUiTcRc4,,,  your audience is knowing your audience
MnIPpUiTcRc4,,,  will allow you to understand the type of
MnIPpUiTcRc5,0.45,0.53,  content they are going to be expecting
MnIPpUiTcRc5,,,  with regard to depth and technical
MnIPpUiTcRc5,,,  detail you would n't want to give the
MnIPpUiTcRc5,,,  same presentation to a group of high
MnIPpUiTcRc5,,,  school student who are interested in
MnIPpUiTcRc5,,,  entrepreneurship that you went to a
MnIPpUiTcRc6,0.54,1.03,  roomful of startup founder and CEOs
MnIPpUiTcRc6,,,  because their expectation and level of
MnIPpUiTcRc6,,,  understanding will be on completely
MnIPpUiTcRc6,,,  different level dig up a much a you
MnIPpUiTcRc6,,,  can about who your audience is what
MnIPpUiTcRc6,,,  industry they work in and what
MnIPpUiTcRc7,1.05,1.13,  position they generally hold this
MnIPpUiTcRc7,,,  allows you to really tailor the content
MnIPpUiTcRc7,,,  and delivery of the presentation in a
MnIPpUiTcRc7,,,  way that will really make it stand out
MnIPpUiTcRc7,,,  and be 'rememorable too many time
MnIPpUiTcRc7,,,  people give killer presentation at one
MnIPpUiTcRc8,1.15,1.23,  venue to a group made up of their core
MnIPpUiTcRc8,,,  audience and then bomb on the same
MnIPpUiTcRc8,,,  presentation to a different group
MnIPpUiTcRc8,,,  because they did n't make the change
MnIPpUiTcRc8,,,  they needed to better address the new
MnIPpUiTcRc8,,,  audience just because you kill it in one
MnIPpUiTcRc9,1.25,1.34,  audience doe n't mean the same exact
MnIPpUiTcRc9,,,  content will replicate the reaction with
MnIPpUiTcRc9,,,  all audience number two use structure
MnIPpUiTcRc9,,,  to build on idea if you stand up and
MnIPpUiTcRc9,,,  give a presentation and all the point
MnIPpUiTcRc9,,,  you want to make are just tossed around
MnIPpUiTcRc10,1.36,1.44,  randomly and they do n't make any sense
MnIPpUiTcRc10,,,  not too many people are going to enjoy
MnIPpUiTcRc10,,,  your presentation and if they remember
MnIPpUiTcRc10,,,  it it 's likely that it 's not for the
MnIPpUiTcRc10,,,  reason that you want them to however if
MnIPpUiTcRc10,,,  you structure your presentation in a way
MnIPpUiTcRc11,1.46,1.55,  that each idea each section build on
MnIPpUiTcRc11,,,  the one before it you help your audience
MnIPpUiTcRc11,,,  connect with the content and create
MnIPpUiTcRc11,,,  logical link between the concept this
MnIPpUiTcRc11,,,  is a great way to make more complex
MnIPpUiTcRc11,,,  idea easier for the audience to
MnIPpUiTcRc12,1.56,2.06,  understand and remember
MnIPpUiTcRc12,,,  number three use visuals another great
MnIPpUiTcRc12,,,  tool to cement those idea in the mind
MnIPpUiTcRc12,,,  of your audience is to use visuals like
MnIPpUiTcRc12,,,  chart graph and infographics to
MnIPpUiTcRc12,,,  illustrate and communicate a concept a
MnIPpUiTcRc13,2.08,2.17,  many a 65 percent of people are
MnIPpUiTcRc13,,,  considered to be visual learner so if
MnIPpUiTcRc13,,,  you do n't take this approach in your
MnIPpUiTcRc13,,,  presentation you are going to ignore the
MnIPpUiTcRc13,,,  vast majority of the population using an
MnIPpUiTcRc13,,,  image regardless of if it 's a picture
MnIPpUiTcRc14,2.18,2.27,  graph or chart can be a much more potent
MnIPpUiTcRc14,,,  conveyor of information and ha a much
MnIPpUiTcRc14,,,  more powerful impact on the audience a
MnIPpUiTcRc14,,,  single image can convey so much
MnIPpUiTcRc14,,,  information just like the old saying
MnIPpUiTcRc14,,,  that a picture 's worth a thousand word
MnIPpUiTcRc15,2.29,2.38,  it really is think of the impact this
MnIPpUiTcRc15,,,  can have when explaining data or result
MnIPpUiTcRc15,,,  in a presentation if you had to stand
MnIPpUiTcRc15,,,  there in front of your audience and go
MnIPpUiTcRc15,,,  through every data point verbally it can
MnIPpUiTcRc15,,,  get bad quickly and this is much more
MnIPpUiTcRc16,2.4,2.48,  common of an occurrence than you might
MnIPpUiTcRc16,,,  think but if you 're able to visualize
MnIPpUiTcRc16,,,  that data for your audience with a graph
MnIPpUiTcRc16,,,  or chart you instantly make it much more
MnIPpUiTcRc16,,,  understandable and memorable showing
MnIPpUiTcRc16,,,  someone 200 percent growth with a graph
MnIPpUiTcRc17,2.49,2.59,  is much more exciting than explaining it
MnIPpUiTcRc17,,,  while they 're looking at the raw data
MnIPpUiTcRc17,,,  for example if I took away the screen of
MnIPpUiTcRc17,,,  this video and all you saw wa black it
MnIPpUiTcRc17,,,  would n't be near a exciting number four
MnIPpUiTcRc17,,,  repetition is your friend having a bit
MnIPpUiTcRc18,3.01,3.08,  of structure in your presentation go a
MnIPpUiTcRc18,,,  long way in keeping the audience engaged
MnIPpUiTcRc18,,,  because they can follow the information
MnIPpUiTcRc18,,,  from step to step but even more than
MnIPpUiTcRc18,,,  just structuring the flow of the
MnIPpUiTcRc18,,,  presentation you also want to build in
MnIPpUiTcRc19,3.1,3.19,  repetition this encourages people to
MnIPpUiTcRc19,,,  remember the key point of the
MnIPpUiTcRc19,,,  presentation and help it stick which
MnIPpUiTcRc19,,,  again make it and you more memorable a
MnIPpUiTcRc19,,,  classic way to go about repetition is
MnIPpUiTcRc19,,,  something Dana learned early on when he
MnIPpUiTcRc20,3.21,3.3,  started his public speaking career
MnIPpUiTcRc20,,,  another speaker at a big regional tech
MnIPpUiTcRc20,,,  event came up to him after a talk and
MnIPpUiTcRc20,,,  complimented Dana on is delivery in the
MnIPpUiTcRc20,,,  depth of the material but asked why he
MnIPpUiTcRc20,,,  did n't use more repetition Dana wa a
MnIPpUiTcRc21,3.32,3.38,  bit stumped because he never really
MnIPpUiTcRc21,,,  thought about that before the other
MnIPpUiTcRc21,,,  speaker suggested that Dana start
MnIPpUiTcRc21,,,  telling the audience what it is he
MnIPpUiTcRc21,,,  wanted to tell them just to give them a
MnIPpUiTcRc21,,,  brief rundown of the key point after
MnIPpUiTcRc22,3.4,3.48,  that move right into the body of the
MnIPpUiTcRc22,,,  presentation and tell them exactly what
MnIPpUiTcRc22,,,  wa highlighted at the beginning but
MnIPpUiTcRc22,,,  obviously with more detail and extra
MnIPpUiTcRc22,,,  element that you add in to make the
MnIPpUiTcRc22,,,  presentation stick then in the
MnIPpUiTcRc23,3.5,3.58,  presentation by telling them what you
MnIPpUiTcRc23,,,  just told them reminding them of the key
MnIPpUiTcRc23,,,  point and a brief summary for final
MnIPpUiTcRc23,,,  repetition using this technique help to
MnIPpUiTcRc23,,,  reinforce the main point of the
MnIPpUiTcRc23,,,  presentation at least three time at the
MnIPpUiTcRc24,4,4.1,  beginning middle and end the key is to
MnIPpUiTcRc24,,,  find a way to do this that it feel
MnIPpUiTcRc24,,,  natural and not overly scholastic and
MnIPpUiTcRc24,,,  that take practice which we 'll talk
MnIPpUiTcRc24,,,  about later on tip number five have a
MnIPpUiTcRc24,,,  story to tell
MnIPpUiTcRc25,4.11,4.19,  the difference between an average
MnIPpUiTcRc25,,,  presentation that people zone out of and
MnIPpUiTcRc25,,,  a great presentation that keep them
MnIPpUiTcRc25,,,  engaged is how you convey the
MnIPpUiTcRc25,,,  information to the audience
MnIPpUiTcRc25,,,  a great way to convey the information or
MnIPpUiTcRc26,4.2,4.29,  key point of your presentation is to
MnIPpUiTcRc26,,,  use a story
MnIPpUiTcRc26,,,  using a story preferably an interesting
MnIPpUiTcRc26,,,  one you get your point across and you 're
MnIPpUiTcRc26,,,  creating a moment in the presentation
MnIPpUiTcRc26,,,  that is memorable and easier for the
MnIPpUiTcRc27,4.31,4.38,  audience to recall later it 's also
MnIPpUiTcRc27,,,  hopefully going to be something that
MnIPpUiTcRc27,,,  catch their attention pulling them in
MnIPpUiTcRc27,,,  to what you were saying one of the key
MnIPpUiTcRc27,,,  here though is that it ha to be a story
MnIPpUiTcRc27,,,  you can tell with commitment and it ha
MnIPpUiTcRc28,4.4,4.49,  to be true always be honest with your
MnIPpUiTcRc28,,,  audience because because if you 're not
MnIPpUiTcRc28,,,  they will know and you will have lost
MnIPpUiTcRc28,,,  all credibility tip number six be
MnIPpUiTcRc28,,,  relatable being relatable is actually
MnIPpUiTcRc28,,,  one of the most important factor of
MnIPpUiTcRc29,4.51,5,  your delivery you want to be someone
MnIPpUiTcRc29,,,  that your audience can relate to but
MnIPpUiTcRc29,,,  they would feel comfortable with talking
MnIPpUiTcRc29,,,  to even when giving a talk a an expert
MnIPpUiTcRc29,,,  on a topic you want the audience to feel
MnIPpUiTcRc29,,,  the relation it help them mentally
MnIPpUiTcRc30,5.02,5.09,  engage with your content and remember
MnIPpUiTcRc30,,,  you and your talk
MnIPpUiTcRc30,,,  most people do n't feel comfortable going
MnIPpUiTcRc30,,,  up and talking to a stern authority
MnIPpUiTcRc30,,,  figure and no one want to listen to
MnIPpUiTcRc30,,,  someone with no confidence so there 's a
MnIPpUiTcRc31,5.11,5.21,  fine balance you need a strike and
MnIPpUiTcRc31,,,  here 's how the most important thing you
MnIPpUiTcRc31,,,  can do to come across a more relatable
MnIPpUiTcRc31,,,  is to be authentic be yourself another
MnIPpUiTcRc31,,,  great way to accomplish this is to work
MnIPpUiTcRc31,,,  on coming across a relaxed which can be
MnIPpUiTcRc32,5.23,5.31,  difficult if you 're not used to
MnIPpUiTcRc32,,,  presenting but this go a long way to
MnIPpUiTcRc32,,,  helping people see you a relatable the
MnIPpUiTcRc32,,,  final way you can be a more relatable is
MnIPpUiTcRc32,,,  to be enthusiastic about your
MnIPpUiTcRc32,,,  presentation your enthusiasm will
MnIPpUiTcRc33,5.33,5.42,  transfer to your audience and now that
MnIPpUiTcRc33,,,  you have enthusiasm in common you will
MnIPpUiTcRc33,,,  begin to see is more relatable if you
MnIPpUiTcRc33,,,  get all three of these technique
MnIPpUiTcRc33,,,  mastered you will be well on your way to
MnIPpUiTcRc33,,,  making it to your audience relate to you
MnIPpUiTcRc34,5.44,5.54,  tip number seven build your confidence
MnIPpUiTcRc34,,,  with practice this might be the last tip
MnIPpUiTcRc34,,,  but it is by far the most important one
MnIPpUiTcRc34,,,  out of these seven confidence and what
MnIPpUiTcRc34,,,  you do is by far the most important
MnIPpUiTcRc34,,,  element of your presentation having
MnIPpUiTcRc35,5.56,6.04,  confidence add an authority to
MnIPpUiTcRc35,,,  everything you say during your
MnIPpUiTcRc35,,,  presentation but you 're not going to
MnIPpUiTcRc35,,,  develop the confidence you need if you
MnIPpUiTcRc35,,,  do n't practice and practice a lot
MnIPpUiTcRc35,,,  whatever Dana give a talk or
MnIPpUiTcRc36,6.05,6.15,  presentation he practice he say for
MnIPpUiTcRc36,,,  hour they do n't want to make sure he
MnIPpUiTcRc36,,,  ha the timing down that he know every
MnIPpUiTcRc36,,,  slide so he doe n't have to read off
MnIPpUiTcRc36,,,  them he know what the next slide is so
MnIPpUiTcRc36,,,  he can smoothly transition between them
MnIPpUiTcRc37,6.16,6.25,  so that he will sound natural and
MnIPpUiTcRc37,,,  authentic and can explain the concept
MnIPpUiTcRc37,,,  and tell the story with confidence and

gaoxXFju6uo1,0,0.17,  At some point in your life you are going to be called upon to give a speech .
gaoxXFju6uo1,,,  Now this might be at work this might be a best man 's speech at a wedding ; it doe n't
gaoxXFju6uo1,,,  matter where because if you ca n't do this without constantly looking down or looking
gaoxXFju6uo1,,,  to the PowerPoint to reference your note you are at a huge disadvantage .
gaoxXFju6uo1,,,  Not only doe it come across a inauthentic when you 're not communicating to the people
gaoxXFju6uo1,,,  eye to eye but if the PowerPoint break which I 've had happen you 're going to find
gaoxXFju6uo2,0.21,0.36,  yourself standing in front of a room full of people who are waiting for you to speak
gaoxXFju6uo2,,,  and you have nothing to say .
gaoxXFju6uo2,,,  So we want to avoid that and today I 'm going to teach you how .
gaoxXFju6uo2,,,  The first thing you need to do is to create an outline of your speech that is memory friendly .
gaoxXFju6uo2,,,  Now what doe this mean ?
gaoxXFju6uo2,,,  The first thing is that it 's chunked in a way that you can remember in your short memory .
gaoxXFju6uo3,0.41,0.53,  Chunks think of it like this .
gaoxXFju6uo3,,,  If I were to tell you a phone number that 's 10 digit .
gaoxXFju6uo3,,,  You 'll probably find that whenever you hear a phone number you 've got to write it down
gaoxXFju6uo3,,,  or you got to remember the first half and ask your friend to remember the second half
gaoxXFju6uo3,,,  and then you type it into the phone .
gaoxXFju6uo3,,,  That 's because there 's 10 chunk .
gaoxXFju6uo4,0.55,1.15,  That 's too many for most people .
gaoxXFju6uo4,,,  Most people can handle anywhere from 5 to 9 chunk .
gaoxXFju6uo4,,,  I play it safe most of my video I had anywhere from 3 to 5 chunk that I have so your first
gaoxXFju6uo4,,,  piece is get an outline 3 to 5 bullet point but these point need to in your head feel
gaoxXFju6uo4,,,  like they flow clearly from one to another .
gaoxXFju6uo4,,,  This piece is very important .
gaoxXFju6uo5,1.16,1.29,  This is how you avoid memorization .
gaoxXFju6uo5,,,  It just kind of flow out of you .
gaoxXFju6uo5,,,  So if I 'm doing a piece on conversation I 'm going to do it in chronological order .
gaoxXFju6uo5,,,  That make sense to me right ?
gaoxXFju6uo5,,,  So the first thing is you approach someone the second thing is what do you say to start
gaoxXFju6uo5,,,  the conversation the third thing is what do you do when you run out of thing to say
gaoxXFju6uo6,1.32,1.43,  and finally how do you say goodbye right ?
gaoxXFju6uo6,,,  That make sense to me .
gaoxXFju6uo6,,,  If you 're giving a pitch and you 're at a meeting right ?
gaoxXFju6uo6,,,  And you 're trying to figure out how to structure thing maybe you think about it from the
gaoxXFju6uo6,,,  customer 's perspective .
gaoxXFju6uo6,,,  First they 're gon na hit the marketing team then they 're gon na finally meet the sale team .
gaoxXFju6uo7,1.47,2.06,  And once they get sold they 're gon na go to the deliverable team .
gaoxXFju6uo7,,,  Whatever it is the piece should flow naturally in your head .
gaoxXFju6uo7,,,  That will save you so much memorization work down the line that 's why I avoid memorizing .
gaoxXFju6uo7,,,  The second piece is that once you have these bullet you flush them out .
gaoxXFju6uo7,,,  I will actually go in and I type everything that I can think of underneath each bullet .
gaoxXFju6uo7,,,  That includes story thing that I want to get detail that I might not have thought of .
gaoxXFju6uo8,2.09,2.21,  That 's gon na help me communicate my main point .
gaoxXFju6uo8,,,  But more importantly this give me a chance to edit the one that I do n't spend time on .
gaoxXFju6uo8,,,  You 've seen this before .
gaoxXFju6uo8,,,  This is when I rambled .
gaoxXFju6uo8,,,  This is when you ramble .
gaoxXFju6uo8,,,  So the really key point is to find your detail and then to cut the one that do n't support
gaoxXFju6uo9,2.27,2.38,  your purpose .
gaoxXFju6uo9,,,  It 's not to memorize all these by the way we just want to get it out on paper .
gaoxXFju6uo9,,,  That 's the second piece .
gaoxXFju6uo9,,,  The third piece is now you 've got a speech written for you right ?
gaoxXFju6uo9,,,  It 's got these chunk .
gaoxXFju6uo9,,,  It 's got the detail .
gaoxXFju6uo10,2.39,3.01,  The third thing is to go through it and subvocalize the entire thing referencing your high
gaoxXFju6uo10,,,  bullet point but without visual cue .
gaoxXFju6uo10,,,  I realized that last since I had a lot of weird word in it let 's break it down .
gaoxXFju6uo10,,,  So first off you want it you 've got your main bullet point but you 're not memorizing this .
gaoxXFju6uo10,,,  You 're going through this speech and it 's gon na change a little bit every time  critically important .
gaoxXFju6uo10,,,  People who try to memorize word for word they blow it because they get off one word
gaoxXFju6uo11,3.05,3.21,  and they ca n't get back on the next sentence .
gaoxXFju6uo11,,,  We all want to have like these main point that we 're memorizing .
gaoxXFju6uo11,,,  When I say subvocalize though that mean that you go through it and just kind of you
gaoxXFju6uo11,,,  know whisper to yourself .
gaoxXFju6uo11,,,  You go through the whole speech like that .
gaoxXFju6uo11,,,  Again not going through it word for word for what you have on there but just hitting
gaoxXFju6uo12,3.24,3.43,  those main point but most importantly you do this without visual cue .
gaoxXFju6uo12,,,  I ca n't tell you how many people I have seen think that they 're preparing for their speech
gaoxXFju6uo12,,,  by reading through it 20 time and then they get up there and there 's nothing they can
gaoxXFju6uo12,,,  do but read the speech .
gaoxXFju6uo12,,,  Or more common in the corporate world people do n't even realize they 're doing it a they
gaoxXFju6uo12,,,  click through a PowerPoint and they do n't realize that they 're taking cue from this
gaoxXFju6uo13,3.47,4.04,  PowerPoint a they go ; they have n't memorized anything .
gaoxXFju6uo13,,,  So if the PowerPoint go down they 've never had the exercise of actually connecting those
gaoxXFju6uo13,,,  piece in their brain .
gaoxXFju6uo13,,,  You need to go through it shut your laptop whatever and just kind of talk through it to
gaoxXFju6uo13,,,  yourself in your own word the only thing you need to worry about are those main point
gaoxXFju6uo13,,,  that should be memorized and should already connect .
gaoxXFju6uo14,4.07,4.24,  If they do n't connect rewrite the speech so that it make sense and put them in an
gaoxXFju6uo14,,,  order that sequence well and just click for you .
gaoxXFju6uo14,,,  You do n't want to be memorizing here .
gaoxXFju6uo14,,,  But there are thing that you have to memorize and that brings me to the fourth point .
gaoxXFju6uo14,,,  The two thing that I will memorize in just about any video that I do are the first sentence
gaoxXFju6uo14,,,  and the last sentence .
gaoxXFju6uo15,4.27,4.37,  You got to nail the first sentence .
gaoxXFju6uo15,,,  Its got to have a hook .
gaoxXFju6uo15,,,  You want it to be interesting .
gaoxXFju6uo15,,,  Do n't rift it so get your first sentence down word for word .
gaoxXFju6uo15,,,  And sometimes I 'll even get the first two or three sentence down because my intro
gaoxXFju6uo15,,,  tend to be something that I stick on to these video after I come up with the concept .
gaoxXFju6uo16,4.41,4.53,  And of course the last sentence ; we 've all been part of a speech where the person did
gaoxXFju6uo16,,,  a good job but at the end they just kind of stood there and like `` ... and that 's the end
gaoxXFju6uo16,,,  of my speech .
gaoxXFju6uo16,,,  Thank you '' right ?
gaoxXFju6uo16,,,  That will blow it .
gaoxXFju6uo16,,,  You do n't have to say `` Thank you that 's the end of my speech '' to cue the applause .
gaoxXFju6uo17,4.57,5.1,  You want to have something that ha a tone a finality .
gaoxXFju6uo17,,,  If you 've watched this channel you know that I do this all the time .
gaoxXFju6uo17,,,  This is not a special one it 's just I 'm used to it .
gaoxXFju6uo17,,,  I say `` Okay so I hope that you guy have enjoyed this video and I 'm looking forward
gaoxXFju6uo17,,,  to seeing you in the next one . ''
gaoxXFju6uo17,,,  That is how I know that I 'm done .
gaoxXFju6uo18,5.11,5.27,  It 's how you know that I 'm done .
gaoxXFju6uo18,,,  And then of course YouTube tell you that I 'm done when the video stop .
gaoxXFju6uo18,,,  But memorize word for word first sentence last sentence that 's going to give you the
gaoxXFju6uo18,,,  sort of bumper on either end .
gaoxXFju6uo18,,,  And that 's how you can speak for 10 minute at a time without actually having to memorize
gaoxXFju6uo18,,,  that much .
gaoxXFju6uo19,5.28,5.42,  I do it all the time .
gaoxXFju6uo19,,,  I 've just done it right here and I hope that you 've seen the example in it a I 've gone
gaoxXFju6uo19,,,  through it .
gaoxXFju6uo19,,,  So if you guy have liked this video go ahead now and if you have not done so subscribe to the channel .
gaoxXFju6uo19,,,  It 's going to get more tip like this we do public speaking we do conversation how
gaoxXFju6uo19,,,  to be your most charismatic self how to be more confident in situation when you 're not
gaoxXFju6uo20,5.46,6.01,  feeling it ; basically everything that fall under the realm of socializing and personal
gaoxXFju6uo20,,,  development ; that stuff that I 'm interested in and want to help you with .

gaoxXFju6uo21,6.06,6.2,  you 'd like to see me do .
gaoxXFju6uo21,,,  And this video wa one that I got a lot of question about how do I do these video without cutting .
gaoxXFju6uo21,,,  This is how .
gaoxXFju6uo21,,,  But it also wa related to another group of question I got which I 'm not sure that I
gaoxXFju6uo21,,,  want to cover but I 'm going to throw it back to you guy .
gaoxXFju6uo21,,,  People are asking about  there are question about YouTube like you know how do you set
gaoxXFju6uo22,6.24,6.38,  up the channel ?
gaoxXFju6uo22,,,  What make a good video and what go into it ?
gaoxXFju6uo22,,,  And I 've learned a little bit about not only you know the psychology behind it which
gaoxXFju6uo22,,,  is my bag but also how to do it at a technical level .
gaoxXFju6uo22,,,  So if you 're interested in either of those the psychological piece that might go into
gaoxXFju6uo22,,,  making a video that 's shared virally or if you 're just into the technical aspect of it

gaoxXFju6uo24,,,  video and I 'm looking forward to seeing you in the next one
d812a7qG9Kw1,0,0.11,   The way you practice a presentation
d812a7qG9Kw1,,,  directly influence the outcome .
d812a7qG9Kw1,,,  So in this video we 're going to talk about
d812a7qG9Kw1,,,  how to practice a speech .
d812a7qG9Kw1,,,  Let 's get into those detail .
d812a7qG9Kw1,,,  ( soft music )
d812a7qG9Kw2,0.15,0.27,  Hello there friend .
d812a7qG9Kw2,,,  Alex Lyon and we are at the end of a three series
d812a7qG9Kw2,,,  on public speaking this month .
d812a7qG9Kw2,,,  The first video is on the importance of public speaking .
d812a7qG9Kw2,,,  The one before this is on how to improve
d812a7qG9Kw2,,,  and this one is specifically on how to practice a speech .
d812a7qG9Kw3,0.3,0.42,  So let 's get into the five way
d812a7qG9Kw3,,,  that I recommend you practicing a speech
d812a7qG9Kw3,,,  and at the end of this video you may wan na stick around
d812a7qG9Kw3,,,  because I have a couple of resource to suggest
d812a7qG9Kw3,,,  to help you move your public speaking to the next level .
d812a7qG9Kw3,,,  So the first way to practice a speech
d812a7qG9Kw4,0.44,0.59,  is to practice from an outline .
d812a7qG9Kw4,,,  Not word for word note .
d812a7qG9Kw4,,,  I 've given some version of this tip
d812a7qG9Kw4,,,  in a lot of different video but let 's say it clearly .
d812a7qG9Kw4,,,  You must practice from an outline a bare bone outline
d812a7qG9Kw4,,,  if you want to sound conversational
d812a7qG9Kw5,1.01,1.11,  which is really what your listener want from you .
d812a7qG9Kw5,,,  They do n't want you to read your speech
d812a7qG9Kw5,,,  they do n't want you to sound like you 've memorized it .
d812a7qG9Kw5,,,  They want a conversation .
d812a7qG9Kw5,,,  And the way to get there is this .
d812a7qG9Kw5,,,  You take whatever note you have to prepare at first
d812a7qG9Kw6,1.14,1.27,  your first few draft
d812a7qG9Kw6,,,  and then you just keep cutting them down over and over again
d812a7qG9Kw6,,,  every time you practice
d812a7qG9Kw6,,,  until all you 're left with is a bulleted outline
d812a7qG9Kw6,,,  of your key point that you are going to hit .
d812a7qG9Kw6,,,  That 's all you really want in the end .
d812a7qG9Kw7,1.29,1.39,  And that way you have a safety net to fall back on
d812a7qG9Kw7,,,  so you wo n't ever lose your place .
d812a7qG9Kw7,,,  You can just glance down at your note
d812a7qG9Kw7,,,  and then bounce your eye right back up
d812a7qG9Kw7,,,  and present from an outline .
d812a7qG9Kw7,,,  That 's the best way .
d812a7qG9Kw8,1.4,1.48,  Practice from an outline
d812a7qG9Kw8,,,  and in the end present like an outline .
d812a7qG9Kw8,,,  One of the thing I will do in fact is
d812a7qG9Kw8,,,  so I do n't sound like I 've memorized it
d812a7qG9Kw8,,,  I do n't sound like a robot
d812a7qG9Kw8,,,  is every time I practice
d812a7qG9Kw9,1.5,2.04,  I might say it a little differently on purpose
d812a7qG9Kw9,,,  so that I 'm not tempted to memorize .
d812a7qG9Kw9,,,  So do n't try to put it word for word do n't try to memorize .
d812a7qG9Kw9,,,  Talking point only and practice from that kind of outline .
d812a7qG9Kw9,,,  The number two tip on how to practice
d812a7qG9Kw9,,,  is to spread out your practice session over time .
d812a7qG9Kw10,2.08,2.2,  Do n't cram the night before .
d812a7qG9Kw10,,,  Do n't cram the morning before your presentation .
d812a7qG9Kw10,,,  I recommend spreading your practice session out
d812a7qG9Kw10,,,  over three day .
d812a7qG9Kw10,,,  The idea is to practice about three time each day
d812a7qG9Kw10,,,  over those three day .
d812a7qG9Kw11,2.21,2.32,  I like to practice about 10 time
d812a7qG9Kw11,,,  before I stand up and speak
d812a7qG9Kw11,,,  and it 's really easier to do if you spread it out .
d812a7qG9Kw11,,,  A lot of great thing happen
d812a7qG9Kw11,,,  when you spread out your practice session .
d812a7qG9Kw11,,,  The first thing that happens to me is it calm me down .
d812a7qG9Kw12,2.35,2.46,  It say to me hey there 's time .
d812a7qG9Kw12,,,  So if my earliest few practice session practice time
d812a7qG9Kw12,,,  do n't go so well I say hey there 's time .
d812a7qG9Kw12,,,  No problem I got a few more day .
d812a7qG9Kw12,,,  I 'll work out these kink .
d812a7qG9Kw12,,,  Another great thing that happens is
d812a7qG9Kw13,2.48,2.56,  let 's say I 've practiced it three time
d812a7qG9Kw13,,,  and then I sleep on it .
d812a7qG9Kw13,,,  Oftentimes in the middle of the day
d812a7qG9Kw13,,,  I 'm doing other thing I 'm washing dish
d812a7qG9Kw13,,,  my brain keep working on it
d812a7qG9Kw13,,,  and keep figuring out better way to say something
d812a7qG9Kw14,2.59,3.1,  or a quicker way to get to the point .
d812a7qG9Kw14,,,  So in that downtime I believe that our brain
d812a7qG9Kw14,,,  are still working on it
d812a7qG9Kw14,,,  and we benefit from that downtime a well .
d812a7qG9Kw14,,,  The other great thing about breaking up
d812a7qG9Kw14,,,  your practice session is it help me
d812a7qG9Kw15,3.12,3.25,  with my composure in the moment .
d812a7qG9Kw15,,,  Because it feel to me like muscle memory with an athlete
d812a7qG9Kw15,,,  that I 've done this before .
d812a7qG9Kw15,,,  I 've been doing this presentation for day .
d812a7qG9Kw15,,,  So it really help me stay composed and in the moment .
d812a7qG9Kw15,,,  So spread out those practice session three time a day
d812a7qG9Kw16,3.28,3.39,  over three day .
d812a7qG9Kw16,,,  That usually is about what you need .
d812a7qG9Kw16,,,  The number three tip is to focus
d812a7qG9Kw16,,,  on only one or two improvement
d812a7qG9Kw16,,,  each time you practice it through .
d812a7qG9Kw16,,,  So you might just work on your structure and your outline
d812a7qG9Kw17,3.41,3.53,  in the first few time through that 's normal .
d812a7qG9Kw17,,,  The next few time through just pick one or two thing
d812a7qG9Kw17,,,  like oh now I 'm just gon na work on looking up
d812a7qG9Kw17,,,  form my outline eye contact for example .
d812a7qG9Kw17,,,  The next time through you might just work on gesture
d812a7qG9Kw17,,,  and your posture a little bit .
d812a7qG9Kw18,3.54,4.06,  Every time you practice
d812a7qG9Kw18,,,  add one or two thing you wan na improve on
d812a7qG9Kw18,,,  because when you add too many thing all at once
d812a7qG9Kw18,,,  when you try to get it perfect every time you practice
d812a7qG9Kw18,,,  you 're going to get paralyzed
d812a7qG9Kw18,,,  because you ca n't really improve more than one thing
d812a7qG9Kw19,4.09,4.21,  or maybe two thing in any given practice session
d812a7qG9Kw19,,,  so focus on improvement
d812a7qG9Kw19,,,  and then start checking those off the list .
d812a7qG9Kw19,,,  And then your fundamental will all be in place
d812a7qG9Kw19,,,  by the time you actually stand up to present .
d812a7qG9Kw19,,,  Number four tip is to keep practice session realistic .
d812a7qG9Kw20,4.26,4.41,  Do not for example the whole time you 're practicing
d812a7qG9Kw20,,,  isolate yourself completely and make condition perfect .
d812a7qG9Kw20,,,  Because what end up happening in the moment
d812a7qG9Kw20,,,  of your actual presentation is it wo n't go perfectly .
d812a7qG9Kw20,,,  People will walk in late
d812a7qG9Kw20,,,  or they 'll get up to use the bathroom
d812a7qG9Kw21,4.43,4.55,  or there 'll be somebody
d812a7qG9Kw21,,,  with a lawn mower outside your window .
d812a7qG9Kw21,,,  In fact I 've been recording this morning
d812a7qG9Kw21,,,  and there is a neighbor working with a chainsaw nearby
d812a7qG9Kw21,,,  that keep distracting me but you just power through it .
d812a7qG9Kw21,,,  So after a few time practicing alone
d812a7qG9Kw22,4.57,5.09,  what I end up doing when I practice
d812a7qG9Kw22,,,  is I add distraction on purpose .
d812a7qG9Kw22,,,  Like I will put the television or some music on
d812a7qG9Kw22,,,  and then I 'll talk over that
d812a7qG9Kw22,,,  because it creates a little bit of noise
d812a7qG9Kw22,,,  and distraction for me to cope with
d812a7qG9Kw23,5.1,5.23,  and I know that if I can practice through those distraction
d812a7qG9Kw23,,,  that during the actual moment I 'll be ready to push through .
d812a7qG9Kw23,,,  Even if something weird or odd happens
d812a7qG9Kw23,,,  it wo n't throw me off a much .
d812a7qG9Kw23,,,  So keep practice session realistic .
d812a7qG9Kw23,,,  And the number five tip is to visualize the first 30 second
d812a7qG9Kw24,5.28,5.4,  and the last 30 second of your presentation .
d812a7qG9Kw24,,,  So by visualization I mean the way a sport athlete doe it .
d812a7qG9Kw24,,,  So you picture yourself walking up
d812a7qG9Kw24,,,  through that first 30 second of the moment
d812a7qG9Kw24,,,  starting off your presentation
d812a7qG9Kw24,,,  and then the last 30 second how you 're gon na close .
d812a7qG9Kw25,5.43,5.55,  So athlete do this with great success .
d812a7qG9Kw25,,,  There is a study by Laure Ecard published in the 1980s
d812a7qG9Kw25,,,  and a lot of other study like it
d812a7qG9Kw25,,,  on basketball free throw shooting
d812a7qG9Kw25,,,  and they found people that only visualized
d812a7qG9Kw25,,,  actually did improve a little bit .
d812a7qG9Kw26,5.57,6.08,  People who practiced free throw basketball free throw
d812a7qG9Kw26,,,  improved a little more .
d812a7qG9Kw26,,,  But athlete who did both
d812a7qG9Kw26,,,  they visualized and they practiced
d812a7qG9Kw26,,,  did the most improvement out of any of the group .
d812a7qG9Kw26,,,  So by visualizing the first 30 second and last 30 second
d812a7qG9Kw27,6.12,6.22,  you 're going to be boosting
d812a7qG9Kw27,,,  your overall performance up quite a bit
d812a7qG9Kw27,,,  even if you do n't get to practice it a few extra session .
d812a7qG9Kw27,,,  So those are the five tip I recommend
d812a7qG9Kw27,,,  in term of how to practice for a speech .
d812a7qG9Kw27,,,  These are the one I use personally
d812a7qG9Kw28,6.24,6.35,  and I have coached a lot of people over the year
d812a7qG9Kw28,,,  to use them and they really do work
d812a7qG9Kw28,,,  so put them into practice a soon a possible .
d812a7qG9Kw28,,,  So I mentioned a couple of resource at the beginning
d812a7qG9Kw28,,,  I wanted to tell you about that are for you .
d812a7qG9Kw28,,,  The first one is a free PDF download .

eRg3Nq2kRug1,0.16,0.3,  whatever the size of your audience a
eRg3Nq2kRug1,,,  one a small group or even a large
eRg3Nq2kRug1,,,  scale theatre presentation it 's really
eRg3Nq2kRug1,,,  important that you 're happy with your
eRg3Nq2kRug1,,,  environment so often the lectern is in
eRg3Nq2kRug1,,,  the wrong place or you 're unhappy with
eRg3Nq2kRug2,0.32,0.43,  where the powerpoint is positioned if
eRg3Nq2kRug2,,,  this is the case it 's really important
eRg3Nq2kRug2,,,  that you fix it before you start the
eRg3Nq2kRug2,,,  main thing is that you can see your
eRg3Nq2kRug2,,,  audience and you can be seen by your
eRg3Nq2kRug2,,,  audience be happy with the sight line
eRg3Nq2kRug3,0.45,1.03,  and make sure that you can be heard by
eRg3Nq2kRug3,,,  everyone in the room the most important
eRg3Nq2kRug3,,,  thing to remember about power point is
eRg3Nq2kRug3,,,  that it 's a visual aid it 's there to
eRg3Nq2kRug3,,,  assist your presentation the
eRg3Nq2kRug3,,,  presentation should always be about you
eRg3Nq2kRug4,1.05,1.21,  and not about the slide so remember the
eRg3Nq2kRug4,,,  Golden Rule le is more when it come
eRg3Nq2kRug4,,,  to the physical relationship with the
eRg3Nq2kRug4,,,  PowerPoint screen keep the body language
eRg3Nq2kRug4,,,  open create a triangle between your
eRg3Nq2kRug4,,,  audience yourself and the PowerPoint
eRg3Nq2kRug5,1.23,1.37,  screen never turn your back on the
eRg3Nq2kRug5,,,  audience because this will just
eRg3Nq2kRug5,,,  disengage them finally it 's really
eRg3Nq2kRug5,,,  important to remember that we can read
eRg3Nq2kRug5,,,  quicker than you can speak so do n't
eRg3Nq2kRug5,,,  generate slide with ream and
eRg3Nq2kRug6,1.39,1.56,  information that you just read off this
eRg3Nq2kRug6,,,  will bore your audience
eRg3Nq2kRug6,,,  one question that we get asked a lot is
eRg3Nq2kRug6,,,  about movement during a presentation
eRg3Nq2kRug6,,,  some people feel that they want to use
eRg3Nq2kRug6,,,  the space and move around while they 're
eRg3Nq2kRug7,1.59,2.15,  presenting the rule of thumb is simple
eRg3Nq2kRug7,,,  movement work but you have to earn it
eRg3Nq2kRug7,,,  there 's a big difference between moving
eRg3Nq2kRug7,,,  at the end of a thought at the end of a
eRg3Nq2kRug7,,,  paragraph and changing position which
eRg3Nq2kRug7,,,  help to signpost to the audience that
eRg3Nq2kRug8,2.17,2.37,  there 's a gear shift in what you 're
eRg3Nq2kRug8,,,  saying a movement which is just nervous
eRg3Nq2kRug8,,,  pacing this nervous pacing movement will
eRg3Nq2kRug8,,,  detract your audience away from the
eRg3Nq2kRug8,,,  clarity of your message all too often
eRg3Nq2kRug8,,,  people start a presentation and from
eRg3Nq2kRug9,2.4,2.58,  beginning to end they barely draw breath
eRg3Nq2kRug9,,,  the full stop is a crucial tool for good
eRg3Nq2kRug9,,,  presentation not only doe the full stop
eRg3Nq2kRug9,,,  allow you to take a breath but more
eRg3Nq2kRug9,,,  importantly it give your audience a
eRg3Nq2kRug9,,,  chance to catch up to absorb the
eRg3Nq2kRug10,3.01,3.15,  information that you 've just given them
eRg3Nq2kRug10,,,  remember any presentation is a journey
eRg3Nq2kRug10,,,  we need to give our audience information
eRg3Nq2kRug10,,,  and allow them to absorb it give them
eRg3Nq2kRug10,,,  the next piece of information and allow
eRg3Nq2kRug10,,,  them to absorb it that moment of
eRg3Nq2kRug11,3.17,3.36,  absorption is what happens at the full
eRg3Nq2kRug11,,,  stop so use it wisely
eRg3Nq2kRug11,,,  if you 're not passionate and interested
eRg3Nq2kRug11,,,  in what you 're talking about how can you
eRg3Nq2kRug11,,,  ever expect your audience to be so often
eRg3Nq2kRug11,,,  especially in British business we
eRg3Nq2kRug13,3.39,3.56,  believe we have to be matter of fact in
eRg3Nq2kRug13,,,  order to be credible actually research
eRg3Nq2kRug13,,,  show the opposite is true the more
eRg3Nq2kRug13,,,  passion that we are about our subject
eRg3Nq2kRug13,,,  matter the more engaged our audience
eRg3Nq2kRug13,,,  become and most importantly the more
eRg3Nq2kRug13,,,  they remember
6A3qofuTUGQ1,0,0.13,  Hi Guys
6A3qofuTUGQ1,,,  ( reading note ) My name is Lisa and today I ’ m going to be talking about the issue of teenage binge drinking .
6A3qofuTUGQ1,,,  So hey guy
6A3qofuTUGQ1,,,  ( too casual ) You guy obviously know me and I obviously know you .
6A3qofuTUGQ1,,,  Sooo today my topic is going to be about teenage binge drinking
6A3qofuTUGQ2,0.18,0.28,  Hey everyone .
6A3qofuTUGQ2,,,  ( closed arm ) Today I ’ m going to be talking about teenage binge drinking
6A3qofuTUGQ2,,,  Hey everyone .
6A3qofuTUGQ2,,,  ( speaks very quickly ) Today I ’ m going to be talking about the issue of teenage binge drinking
6A3qofuTUGQ2,,,  giggle sorry guy I kind of forgot my next sentence .
6A3qofuTUGQ2,,,  cricket chirping
6A3qofuTUGQ3,0.29,0.43,  ORAL PRESENTATIONS  The Basics
6A3qofuTUGQ3,,,  1 START OFF WITH A BANG
6A3qofuTUGQ3,,,  The first thing to remember is to PLEASE start off in an interesting way .
6A3qofuTUGQ3,,,  No more of this :
6A3qofuTUGQ3,,,  So unoriginal “ Good Afternoon everyone a you may know my name is Lisa today I ’ m
6A3qofuTUGQ3,,,  going to be talking about binge drinking ”
6A3qofuTUGQ4,0.45,1,  So cliche .
6A3qofuTUGQ4,,,  So Boring “ Hi my name is Lisa and today I ’ m going to be talking about binge drinking ”
6A3qofuTUGQ4,,,  Try to start off a little bit more like this :
6A3qofuTUGQ4,,,  a ) How would you feel if you were stuck inside a cage 24/7 left inside a dungeon where
6A3qofuTUGQ4,,,  it ’ s completely dark and there ’ s just no way of escaping ?
6A3qofuTUGQ4,,,  This is exactly what it ’ s like for caged chicken .
6A3qofuTUGQ5,1.03,1.2,  b ) Let me guess everyday before school you have a certain routine .
6A3qofuTUGQ5,,,  You wake up you brush your teeth you put your uniform on have breakfast and you ’ re
6A3qofuTUGQ5,,,  ready to go .
6A3qofuTUGQ5,,,  You catch the train and then you ’ re at school .
6A3qofuTUGQ5,,,  But what if the train is sort of crowded that you end up not being able to catch the
6A3qofuTUGQ5,,,  train in time not making it to school in time and missing out on that assessment that
6A3qofuTUGQ6,1.25,1.37,  you have first thing in the morning .
6A3qofuTUGQ6,,,  Today I ’ m going to be talking about the importance of adding more train to our public
6A3qofuTUGQ6,,,  system .
6A3qofuTUGQ6,,,  ( Originality is key )
6A3qofuTUGQ6,,,  Whether it ’ s just starting off with rhetorical question an anecdote or a scenario of some
6A3qofuTUGQ6,,,  sort please just try to get creative and get your audience ’ s attention immediately .
6A3qofuTUGQ7,1.42,1.55,  You ’ ve only got one chance to get this right .
6A3qofuTUGQ7,,,  So you might a well start it off with a BANG !
6A3qofuTUGQ7,,,  2 BODY LANGUAGE
6A3qofuTUGQ7,,,  Don ’ t cross your arm because that mean that you ’ re shut off from your audience
6A3qofuTUGQ7,,,  and that you ’ re not ready to engage with them and to welcome them into your topic .
6A3qofuTUGQ7,,,  Feel free to use your arm  not too much but try to keep yourself relaxed keep your
6A3qofuTUGQ8,2,2.17,  body relaxed so that you ’ ll move naturally .
6A3qofuTUGQ8,,,  Look interested in your topic a well it should be something that you ’ re passionate
6A3qofuTUGQ8,,,  about .. so if you look disinterested then what ’ s the point of anyone else being interested
6A3qofuTUGQ8,,,  in what your topic is about .
6A3qofuTUGQ8,,,  Make sure that your expression fit the topic so if it ’ s going to be something upsetting
6A3qofuTUGQ8,,,  if it ’ s something devastating emerge your emotion with that .
6A3qofuTUGQ9,2.2,2.27,  Get in tuen with what your topic about .
6A3qofuTUGQ9,,,  3 NO AWKWARD BREAK
6A3qofuTUGQ9,,,  If you get stuck don ’ t stop .
6A3qofuTUGQ9,,,  Don ’ t be like… .
6A3qofuTUGQ9,,,  eye wandering around ...
6A3qofuTUGQ9,,,  Um… giggle ......
6A3qofuTUGQ10,2.29,2.44,  Geez what wa it
6A3qofuTUGQ10,,,  But just stand there recollect your thought and then go again .
6A3qofuTUGQ10,,,  It might feel like eternity but at the very least you ’ re not filling in your oral with
6A3qofuTUGQ10,,,  random word that just don ’ t contribute to anything .
6A3qofuTUGQ10,,,  And it also disengages the audience too .
6A3qofuTUGQ10,,,  “ And so a I wa mentioning before the statistic are so high that one of… ”
6A3qofuTUGQ11,2.5,3.01,  4 PRACTICE
6A3qofuTUGQ11,,,  One of the thing that people don ’ t do enough of is practice their oral .
6A3qofuTUGQ11,,,  They get held up in writing the actual oral and they get stressed out on the actual day .
6A3qofuTUGQ11,,,  But what about practicing beforehand ?
6A3qofuTUGQ11,,,  You need to make sure that your speed is on point .
6A3qofuTUGQ11,,,  Just remember that you ’ ll probably be nervous .
6A3qofuTUGQ12,3.03,3.17,  So you ’ re going to be speaking a little bit faster than you normally would be .
6A3qofuTUGQ12,,,  Make sure you memorize the speech a much a possible .
6A3qofuTUGQ12,,,  Memorizing a speech mean that you can then shift away from just looking at your paper
6A3qofuTUGQ12,,,  and that you can start focusing on actually targeting the audience that ’ s in front of
6A3qofuTUGQ12,,,  you .
6A3qofuTUGQ12,,,  The more you can engage with them the better it will be for you .
6A3qofuTUGQ13,3.19,3.32,  And the more confidence you will have .
6A3qofuTUGQ13,,,  Okay guy I hope you enjoyed this video .
6A3qofuTUGQ13,,,  I wanted to do something a little different .
6A3qofuTUGQ13,,,  Especially with oral presentation it ’ s all about the performance so I kind of wanted
6A3qofuTUGQ13,,,  to tap into that a little bit .
6A3qofuTUGQ13,,,  I know that some of the point that I ’ ve addressed here today seem really obvious  but
6A3qofuTUGQ14,3.36,3.55,  despite the fact that it ’ s obvious there ’ s still a reason why this stuff happens .
6A3qofuTUGQ14,,,  And you still see it every single year and I ’ m sure you know exactly what I mean .
6A3qofuTUGQ14,,,  There ’ s always that one classmate that doe the big no or that one classmate that ’ s
6A3qofuTUGQ14,,,  you know  talking like this talk behind paper .
6A3qofuTUGQ14,,,  Whatever it is hopefully if you ’ re one of these people what you learned from today
6A3qofuTUGQ14,,,  or what ha been reiterated into your head for today Start applying that into your oral .
6A3qofuTUGQ15,4.01,4.21,  If you guy like this video please give it a thumb up because that will let me know
6A3qofuTUGQ15,,,  that you guy are more interested in deeper oral presentation topic .
6A3qofuTUGQ15,,,  So whether that is structuring an argument or how to present in front of different audience
6A3qofuTUGQ15,,,  I know some school do it in front of the classroom but other school just do it in
6A3qofuTUGQ15,,,  front of teacher or small group of student or how to formulate argument to be more persuasive .
6A3qofuTUGQ15,,,  So if you actually needed some help with what topic you should do for this year ’ s oral
6A3qofuTUGQ16,4.26,4.43,  presentation if you haven ’ t decided already I ’ ve actually compiled a list of about close
6A3qofuTUGQ16,,,  to 20 oral topic potentially you could choose .
6A3qofuTUGQ16,,,  They ’ re pretty much the best one that are out there at the moment so definitely check
6A3qofuTUGQ16,,,  out the description box below and you will find a link to the blog post for that where
6A3qofuTUGQ16,,,  you can also download a PDF .
6A3qofuTUGQ16,,,  Best of luck for your oral .
6A3qofuTUGQ18,4.44,5.16,  I ’ m sure you guy are going to do absolutely fine .
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  Just remember at the end of the day even if you have no idea what you ’ re talking
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  about .
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  Confidence is key .
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  I could be talking about nonsense right now and talking about God know what and yadi
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  yadi yah but because I ’ m making eye contact because my tone is reassuring you will most
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  likely believe it .
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  Okay so yeah I ’ ll see you guy next time .
6A3qofuTUGQ18,,,  BYEE
eHhqWbI0y4M1,0.01,0.34,  Do you have to make presentation ?
eHhqWbI0y4M1,,,  Do you hate presentation ? I like presentation
eHhqWbI0y4M1,,,  but one thing that you are probably maybe good at with presentation are making PowerPoint
eHhqWbI0y4M1,,,  presentation because you have visual aid to help you so you do n't really have to talk
eHhqWbI0y4M1,,,  a much if you 're nervous about talking . Presentation skill is something that you
eHhqWbI0y4M1,,,  can work on . We have video on www.engvid.com to help you with presentation skill . So
eHhqWbI0y4M2,0.42,1.2,  go and check those out for learning how to speak during presentation .
eHhqWbI0y4M2,,,  But what we 're going to focus on today is the visual aspect of presentation so your
eHhqWbI0y4M2,,,  PowerPoint thing . Some thing to do and some thing not to do . So here we are presentation
eHhqWbI0y4M2,,,  skill . The first thing and one of the thing that make these presentation so fun are
eHhqWbI0y4M2,,,  picture . But we have to be careful . The template that you have already included in your presentation
eHhqWbI0y4M2,,,  software they 're boring . People use them all the time . So I suggest you try and download
eHhqWbI0y4M3,1.28,2,  some other picture to make your presentation more interesting . And with that make sure
eHhqWbI0y4M3,,,  that on one slide you have one image . Make it interesting .
eHhqWbI0y4M3,,,  Do not have a split screen . So do n't have two image on one slide . Do not have a collage
eHhqWbI0y4M3,,,  that 's insane . A collage is many different small picture on one screen . Even when I
eHhqWbI0y4M3,,,  see a collage there 's a lot of collage coming out on Facebook now and I 'm like :
eHhqWbI0y4M3,,,  `` Too many picture . Ca n't understand . '' Our brain just can not comprehend all those picture especially
eHhqWbI0y4M4,2.07,2.36,  when you 're having the slide up for a short period of time . Do n't make it like a photo
eHhqWbI0y4M4,,,  album . Do n't put million and seven picture and ... Keep it simple . Put a single image
eHhqWbI0y4M4,,,  on each slide . Try and pick image that you actually like and not too distracting . You
eHhqWbI0y4M4,,,  do n't want puppy dog and thing . Make something simple but something that you like and make
eHhqWbI0y4M4,,,  sure it look nice .
eHhqWbI0y4M4,,,  The next one you have to worry about is the lettering . So the lettering you also might
eHhqWbI0y4M5,2.41,3.19,  know this a the font . So font and lettering are the same . One thing that you do not want
eHhqWbI0y4M5,,,  to do is have really fancy or beautiful lettering . Simply ... The reason is some people ca n't
eHhqWbI0y4M5,,,  read when the letter are fancy especially if you are doing presentation for people
eHhqWbI0y4M5,,,  whose ... Do not have English a their first language if you take the letter and you
eHhqWbI0y4M5,,,  write them even cursive a lot of people have problem reading cursive . So I suggest you
eHhqWbI0y4M5,,,  use something more traditional . There 's lot of very easy font you can get from
eHhqWbI0y4M6,3.26,3.58,  your ... Whatever word processing you use . So make it simple easy to read .
eHhqWbI0y4M6,,,  Another problem that you might have is the script is too big or too small . So remember
eHhqWbI0y4M6,,,  that when you 're making your presentation you 're doing it probably on your laptop or
eHhqWbI0y4M6,,,  your desktop or your iPad or your phone so the font or the lettering is going to be
eHhqWbI0y4M6,,,  different than when you put it up on the projector . So if at all possible if you can check it
eHhqWbI0y4M6,,,  out before you do the presentation . Look at your ... Hook up your laptop or whatever and
eHhqWbI0y4M7,4.04,4.38,  see if you can actually see it on the screen because the font is different . You might think
eHhqWbI0y4M7,,,  that on your laptop it 's a good size but when it get on the projection screen it 's
eHhqWbI0y4M7,,,  tiny ; or it take up too much space and it 's too big .
eHhqWbI0y4M7,,,  Next up are the word or the text . So there 's been study done on how many line of text
eHhqWbI0y4M7,,,  a human can absorb or understand and any more than six you 've lost the people . So
eHhqWbI0y4M7,,,  try and keep on each slide one very simple image with very traditional clear text and
eHhqWbI0y4M8,4.47,5.2,  put only two or three line on each slide . Do n't put bullet point . If you have more
eHhqWbI0y4M8,,,  than six line or if you have bullet point again we just ... We just ca n't remember them
eHhqWbI0y4M8,,,  all . We just lose focus . We have something called too much information too much info
eHhqWbI0y4M8,,,  TMI . `` Too much information '' mean that if you have more than two or three line we 're
eHhqWbI0y4M8,,,  just not getting it . Our brain ca n't ... We just ca n't learn it like you want u to .
eHhqWbI0y4M8,,,  The other one that 's probably really important is the colour that you use . Now it 's fun
eHhqWbI0y4M9,5.26,5.58,  to have different colour it help u ... As you can see on the board it help u create
eHhqWbI0y4M9,,,  contrast and highlight word or thing you think that are important but if you have
eHhqWbI0y4M9,,,  different colour within one word ... Can you read this word ? It make it really really
eHhqWbI0y4M9,,,  difficult to read . This word say `` different '' and maybe when you 're watching the video at
eHhqWbI0y4M9,,,  home you ca n't maybe see the `` i '' or the `` e '' . This look very childish . When we 're kid
eHhqWbI0y4M9,,,  we can make different colour and it 's fun but your presentation is n't for child .
eHhqWbI0y4M10,6.02,6.26,  It 's not meant to be fun . You want to have the title and the word very easy to read .
eHhqWbI0y4M10,,,  You do n't want them to be difficult and you do n't want to have people straining their
eHhqWbI0y4M10,,,  eye to figure out what word that is .
eHhqWbI0y4M10,,,  I will never forget my grade 4 art teacher telling me that you can never use different
eHhqWbI0y4M10,,,  colour in one word . As an 8 year old I wa just taken back . I wa like :
eHhqWbI0y4M10,,,  `` Oh my god I use different colour all the time Mr . Riley . '' No . So I remember this . Thank you Mr. Riley
eHhqWbI0y4M11,6.33,7.03,  if you 're still out there for teaching me this very important lesson .
eHhqWbI0y4M11,,,  But what you can do is you can definitely use different colour one different colour
eHhqWbI0y4M11,,,  to highlight or emphasize one word . So down here you can use one different colour to
eHhqWbI0y4M11,,,  emphasize important word . So a you can see I want you to focus on the word `` one '' and
eHhqWbI0y4M11,,,  emphasize . The other word I 'm keeping black . So one different colour will really help this
eHhqWbI0y4M11,,,  pop out or stand out . If you use too many colour again get confused . So ...
eHhqWbI0y4M12,7.14,7.43,  I 'm dying . Someone get me an Alka .
eHhqWbI0y4M12,,,  The last thing is you want a strong contrast of the letter and the background . So if
eHhqWbI0y4M12,,,  my background colour is blue I would n't want to have green lettering because green and
eHhqWbI0y4M12,,,  blue are very similar colour very similar shade so you have to make sure that if your ...
eHhqWbI0y4M12,,,  If you have a grey background you want something that really stand out . You have to be careful
eHhqWbI0y4M12,,,  of the colour that you choose for the background and the lettering .
eHhqWbI0y4M14,7.47,8.35,  So if you can keep these four major category in mind when you 're doing or making a presentation ...
eHhqWbI0y4M14,,,  Colour keep it simple . One or two different colour is fantastic .
eHhqWbI0y4M14,,,  Make sure the word or the text are limited to two or three major point .
eHhqWbI0y4M14,,,  You want to build your presentation instead of just throwing information at people .
eHhqWbI0y4M14,,,  Make sure the lettering is clear nothing crazy .
eHhqWbI0y4M14,,,  Make sure it 's not too big not too small . And also make sure that you 're not
eHhqWbI0y4M14,,,  overloading the people with picture because it 's going to lose from your actual presentation point .

41ZBTgYSl0c1,0,0.27,  Have you ever wondered how those great speaker that you love to listen to have
41ZBTgYSl0c1,,,  a conversational approach to their delivery ? We 're going to teach you how to
41ZBTgYSl0c1,,,  have what 's called an extemporaneous delivery style coming up .
41ZBTgYSl0c1,,,  Hello friend . I 'm Alex Lyon and Communication Coach this channel is here
41ZBTgYSl0c1,,,  to help you increase your impact and lead your team to higher level of
41ZBTgYSl0c1,,,  excellence . One of the way you can do that is through better presentation
41ZBTgYSl0c2,0.32,0.56,  skill . Today we 're going to unpack how to speak extemporaneously . In other word
41ZBTgYSl0c2,,,  conversationally . Let 's put it this way . Nobody want to hear you give a
41ZBTgYSl0c2,,,  memorized presentation . Nobody want to listen to you read a presentation word
41ZBTgYSl0c2,,,  for word . And here 's how I know this . Do you want to listen to someone read a
41ZBTgYSl0c2,,,  presentation word for word ? Do you want to listen to someone like a robot give
41ZBTgYSl0c2,,,  you a memorized word presentation . Nobody like it and unless
41ZBTgYSl0c3,1,1.25,  you 're President of the United States and you 're using teleprompter you
41ZBTgYSl0c3,,,  probably wo n't ever be asked to do this in a professional setting . Almost
41ZBTgYSl0c3,,,  everybody across the board that 's at that high level of speaking us what we
41ZBTgYSl0c3,,,  call extemporaneous delivery style . And that mean when you know the material so
41ZBTgYSl0c3,,,  that you could speak conversationally with limited note in a structured way .
41ZBTgYSl0c3,,,  Now it sound pretty basic and you appreciate it when you see it but it
41ZBTgYSl0c4,1.3,1.52,  actually take quite a bit of work to get there . But once you know how to do it
41ZBTgYSl0c4,,,  this way I doubt you 'll ever want to go back to reading your note word for word
41ZBTgYSl0c4,,,  again . So first let 's talk about how to do this . The first tip is that you have
41ZBTgYSl0c4,,,  to commit to a structure . The structure is the backbone of the whole
41ZBTgYSl0c4,,,  presentation that help you keep your place and help you move forward
41ZBTgYSl0c4,,,  according to your plan . You 're going to need a really clear introduction body
41ZBTgYSl0c5,1.56,2.13,  and conclusion . And within each of those section in you 're introduction for
41ZBTgYSl0c5,,,  example you 're going to have certain part that you hit . Four part in your introduction .
41ZBTgYSl0c5,,,  You 're going to know your clear two or three or four main point you 're going
41ZBTgYSl0c5,,,  to hit with nice transition and information in each of those bucket . And
41ZBTgYSl0c5,,,  you 're going to have a really clear conclusion . You 're going to know how you
41ZBTgYSl0c5,,,  end . So you have to have a clear structure . If you do n't have a clear
41ZBTgYSl0c6,2.17,2.4,  structure it 's going to be very difficult to get comfortable enough to
41ZBTgYSl0c6,,,  have a conversational style . The second tip is that you 're going to have to
41ZBTgYSl0c6,,,  practice probably more than you realize . I recommend practicing a
41ZBTgYSl0c6,,,  presentation about ten time . Now that might seem like a lot . However over the
41ZBTgYSl0c6,,,  year I 've been doing coaching and teaching college for about 20 year in
41ZBTgYSl0c6,,,  professional setting it 's really no different if you only practice two to
41ZBTgYSl0c7,2.44,3.05,  three time you 're just not going to do that well that 's not enough repetition
41ZBTgYSl0c7,,,  to get completely comfortable with a topic completely comfortable expressing
41ZBTgYSl0c7,,,  yourself and connecting while you 're sharing information . Time and time again
41ZBTgYSl0c7,,,  when I pull really skilled speaker aside I say about how many time did you
41ZBTgYSl0c7,,,  practice ? the number ten come up a lot . Some people that are exceptionally
41ZBTgYSl0c7,,,  gifted might only practice eight or so time . Most people 10 or even more . So
41ZBTgYSl0c8,3.09,3.37,  practice about ten time . Now the way you practice ten time becomes really
41ZBTgYSl0c8,,,  critical if you want to speak conversationally . Let 's say the first
41ZBTgYSl0c8,,,  time you practice you use a full set of note . Now the number one killer is too
41ZBTgYSl0c8,,,  many note and so you want to pare down your note to the bare minimum that you
41ZBTgYSl0c8,,,  need to give that presentation . So you start off the first and you let 's say
41ZBTgYSl0c8,,,  you 're practicing ten time the first two or three time you practice you have
41ZBTgYSl0c9,3.39,3.59,  your full set of note . The more you practice the more you should try to get
41ZBTgYSl0c9,,,  away from that look up a little more often so that in the next two to three
41ZBTgYSl0c9,,,  time you practice I recommend cutting those note about in half . So maybe you
41ZBTgYSl0c9,,,  have let 's say you start off with four page of note cut it down to about two
41ZBTgYSl0c9,,,  page of note . And instead of full sentence you want to pare it down to
41ZBTgYSl0c9,,,  maybe half sentence and then you practice it another two or three time .
41ZBTgYSl0c10,4.02,4.26,  And then the last two or three time you practice you should be all the way down
41ZBTgYSl0c10,,,  to very simple bullet talking point that are just maybe even a single word
41ZBTgYSl0c10,,,  or a short phrase . And the goal here is that a you 're practicing that eighth
41ZBTgYSl0c10,,,  ninth or tenth time all you have to do is look at your note just for a moment
41ZBTgYSl0c10,,,  and you see maybe even one keyword maybe it just say Hawaii and you know you 're
41ZBTgYSl0c10,,,  going to tell a story about Hawaii that last about 30 second . So now
41ZBTgYSl0c11,4.31,4.56,  there 's no reason to really look at your note beyond glancing down seeing the
41ZBTgYSl0c11,,,  word and putting your eye back up on your listener and
41ZBTgYSl0c11,,,  connecting with them conversationally in that story about Hawaii . So you want to
41ZBTgYSl0c11,,,  pare your note way back and practice that way . So the next tip is each time
41ZBTgYSl0c11,,,  you practice it say it in a variety of way . In other word do n't get locked in
41ZBTgYSl0c11,,,  to using the exact same sentence the exact same phrase each time you present .
41ZBTgYSl0c12,5.01,5.22,  I even sometimes deliberately will say thing differently each time I do it
41ZBTgYSl0c12,,,  because it give me another way to express it . In fact a telltale sign for
41ZBTgYSl0c12,,,  me when I 'm watching a speaker and I can tell they 're just memorizing this word
41ZBTgYSl0c12,,,  for word is they might start a sentence a certain way and then not remember how
41ZBTgYSl0c12,,,  to finish it and so they 'll go back and they 'll start it over again a little
41ZBTgYSl0c12,,,  differently so they can land at the end of sentence the way they originally
41ZBTgYSl0c13,5.25,5.48,  practiced it . That 's going to start to sound very robotic . You want to say
41ZBTgYSl0c13,,,  thing in a many way a possible when you 're practicing so that in the moment
41ZBTgYSl0c13,,,  no matter what happens you can move ahead in that presentation smoothly and
41ZBTgYSl0c13,,,  still maintain that nice conversational approach . So practice it in a variety of
41ZBTgYSl0c13,,,  way . The other thing you want to do is keep your practice session realistic .
41ZBTgYSl0c13,,,  Keep some real world . So for example I like to even though I 'm alone when I 'm
41ZBTgYSl0c14,5.54,6.14,  practicing oftentimes I like to look up away from my note while I 'm practicing
41ZBTgYSl0c14,,,  because it 's a good habit to get into to look up . So if I practice only looking
41ZBTgYSl0c14,,,  at my note well that 's a habit I 'm engraining so that when I go to my actual
41ZBTgYSl0c14,,,  presentation I 'm going to have a habit of looking at my note . So you want to
41ZBTgYSl0c14,,,  practice by looking up sometimes . In fact I know a good friend of mine
41ZBTgYSl0c14,,,  actually set up stuffed animal and even put pillow inside of winter coat and
41ZBTgYSl0c15,6.18,6.37,  put face and paper on top of them and then when they were practicing that
41ZBTgYSl0c15,,,  presentation they were looking at their stuffed animal and looking at those
41ZBTgYSl0c15,,,  dummy they made . And during the presentation it wa much easier because they
41ZBTgYSl0c15,,,  practice that way to connect because they made their practicing realistic . Now
41ZBTgYSl0c15,,,  obviously they 're not real people but maybe you have a roommate or even a dog
41ZBTgYSl0c15,,,  that you can present to to keep it real . Once you 're really comfortable and
41ZBTgYSl0c16,6.42,7.04,  you 've kept it real sometimes people will even add distraction so they might
41ZBTgYSl0c16,,,  turn the television on in the background are some music on in the background or
41ZBTgYSl0c16,,,  do it in a somewhat public area . You might look a little crazy but if you can
41ZBTgYSl0c16,,,  present conversationally and get through your outline in a nice extemporaneous
41ZBTgYSl0c16,,,  fashion even with distraction then you 're much more likely to speak
41ZBTgYSl0c16,,,  conversationally in the moment . You never know for example when there 's going to be
41ZBTgYSl0c17,7.08,7.29,  someone outside with a jackhammer someone outside with a lawn mower . Someone 's
41ZBTgYSl0c17,,,  going to come in late . Someone 's going to leave early . In the moment every little
41ZBTgYSl0c17,,,  every little distraction can really heighten your nervousness and throw
41ZBTgYSl0c17,,,  you off if you 're not prepared for it . So the benefit of it speaking
41ZBTgYSl0c17,,,  extemporaneously can not be underestimated . First of all audience
41ZBTgYSl0c17,,,  prefer this style of delivery from the presenter far and away . Nobody want to
41ZBTgYSl0c18,7.34,7.56,  hear you memorize or or read your presentation . Believe me you do n't want
41ZBTgYSl0c18,,,  to do it anymore and then you want to listen to it . And this is a skill that
41ZBTgYSl0c18,,,  you can build on if you can break the habit get away from that safety net all
41ZBTgYSl0c18,,,  those note extemporaneous delivery that conversational approach is a really
41ZBTgYSl0c18,,,  great skill to build on . You can use it in all kind of professional setting .
41ZBTgYSl0c18,,,  You 're going to bring it with you for the rest of your life . So I highly
41ZBTgYSl0c19,7.59,8.2,  recommend you take the plunge pare those note down to the bare minimum and start
41ZBTgYSl0c19,,,  practicing in a realistic way . The question of the day what are your tip
41ZBTgYSl0c19,,,  for conversational delivery for making thing much more extemporaneous . I would
41ZBTgYSl0c19,,,  love to hear your comment in that section below . So thanks . God bless . And I
41ZBTgYSl0c19,,,  hope that you speak more conversationally in your very next
41ZBTgYSl0c19,,,  presentation .
wVcxAhbeMWc1,0.03,0.13,  a you think about your upcoming
wVcxAhbeMWc1,,,  communication setting whether you 're
wVcxAhbeMWc1,,,  going to be speaking to one or two
wVcxAhbeMWc1,,,  people at a table because you might be
wVcxAhbeMWc1,,,  selling them insurance or you may be
wVcxAhbeMWc1,,,  speaking to a large audience or maybe
wVcxAhbeMWc2,0.16,0.29,  it 's a staff meeting or a meeting with
wVcxAhbeMWc2,,,  potential client or perhaps even a
wVcxAhbeMWc2,,,  general audience you want to consider
wVcxAhbeMWc2,,,  the power of using image and analogy
wVcxAhbeMWc2,,,  to communicate any complex concept the
wVcxAhbeMWc2,,,  way the human brain work is that we
wVcxAhbeMWc3,0.31,0.42,  have a tendency to remember image and
wVcxAhbeMWc3,,,  emotion that feeling that vision more
wVcxAhbeMWc3,,,  than we will remember fact and figure
wVcxAhbeMWc3,,,  so having that analogy give your
wVcxAhbeMWc3,,,  audience something to hold on to and
wVcxAhbeMWc3,,,  remember let 's take a look at four
wVcxAhbeMWc4,0.45,0.57,  example of great analogy if for
wVcxAhbeMWc4,,,  example you 're in the financial world
wVcxAhbeMWc4,,,  and you 're explaining the concept of
wVcxAhbeMWc4,,,  compound interest for you it may be very
wVcxAhbeMWc4,,,  easy to understand but for someone who 's
wVcxAhbeMWc4,,,  not familiar with the concept it 's hard
wVcxAhbeMWc5,0.59,1.14,  to wrap their brain around it so one
wVcxAhbeMWc5,,,  great analogy I heard is a financial
wVcxAhbeMWc5,,,  advisor said compound interest work the
wVcxAhbeMWc5,,,  way snowball work if you take a small
wVcxAhbeMWc5,,,  amount of snow and you start to roll it
wVcxAhbeMWc5,,,  it increase in size the diameter grows
wVcxAhbeMWc6,1.16,1.29,  and every time you roll it that snowball
wVcxAhbeMWc6,,,  grows exponentially and that 's the way
wVcxAhbeMWc6,,,  compound interest work every roll
wVcxAhbeMWc6,,,  creates a great increase in an even
wVcxAhbeMWc6,,,  greater increase so over time something
wVcxAhbeMWc6,,,  quite small can become quite something
wVcxAhbeMWc7,1.31,1.44,  quite large that 's the first analogy
wVcxAhbeMWc7,,,  here 's another one also from the
wVcxAhbeMWc7,,,  financial world someone who once
wVcxAhbeMWc7,,,  explained the way stock work the way a
wVcxAhbeMWc7,,,  rubber ball bouncing work now it 's not
wVcxAhbeMWc7,,,  always true but it 's a great image to
wVcxAhbeMWc8,1.46,1.57,  hold on to so he said to me think about
wVcxAhbeMWc8,,,  the way a bouncing rubber ball go high
wVcxAhbeMWc8,,,  into the air you bounce on the ground to
wVcxAhbeMWc8,,,  go shooting up in the air quite quickly
wVcxAhbeMWc8,,,  at the start and then it begin to slow
wVcxAhbeMWc8,,,  down just before it make the turn and
wVcxAhbeMWc9,2.01,2.14,  after the turn it drop like a stone
wVcxAhbeMWc9,,,  so he 'd want me to watch out for fast
wVcxAhbeMWc9,,,  rising stock because they will shoot up
wVcxAhbeMWc9,,,  and they will start to slow
wVcxAhbeMWc9,,,  he turned and he said in that slowing
wVcxAhbeMWc9,,,  down point is when you want to pay
wVcxAhbeMWc10,2.16,2.25,  attention because a lot of people make
wVcxAhbeMWc10,,,  the mistake of a holding on to the stock
wVcxAhbeMWc10,,,  at the top thinking well maybe it 's
wVcxAhbeMWc10,,,  gon na shoot up again but he said that 's
wVcxAhbeMWc10,,,  very rare it happens but it 's rare and
wVcxAhbeMWc10,,,  often a they 're slowing down that is
wVcxAhbeMWc11,2.27,2.37,  the moment but they 're about to drop
wVcxAhbeMWc11,,,  like a stone and that 's the moment you
wVcxAhbeMWc11,,,  want to get out again not always the
wVcxAhbeMWc11,,,  case but a great image a great analogy
wVcxAhbeMWc11,,,  for someone like me for someone like you
wVcxAhbeMWc11,,,  to hold on to so think about a complex
wVcxAhbeMWc12,2.4,2.52,  concept that you have that you take for
wVcxAhbeMWc12,,,  granted that you understand anything how
wVcxAhbeMWc12,,,  can I create this in an image and
wVcxAhbeMWc12,,,  analogy that my audience can grasp here
wVcxAhbeMWc12,,,  two more this come from a tech company
wVcxAhbeMWc12,,,  who wa in the process of acquiring
wVcxAhbeMWc13,2.54,3.06,  another corporation and they said that
wVcxAhbeMWc13,,,  we have to a we continue to run our own
wVcxAhbeMWc13,,,  business acquire this other corporation
wVcxAhbeMWc13,,,  and integrated into our service so he
wVcxAhbeMWc13,,,  said that what we 're going to do is be
wVcxAhbeMWc13,,,  running down the highway we 're gon na be
wVcxAhbeMWc14,3.08,3.19,  driving down the highway at 70 mile an
wVcxAhbeMWc14,,,  hour changing the tire a we go great
wVcxAhbeMWc14,,,  image it warns his staff and warned his
wVcxAhbeMWc14,,,  team that what they were in for wa a
wVcxAhbeMWc14,,,  very intensive period and it gave them
wVcxAhbeMWc14,,,  an image to keep in mind and here 's the
wVcxAhbeMWc15,3.22,3.33,  fourth the fourth come from the
wVcxAhbeMWc15,,,  insurance world someone wa talking
wVcxAhbeMWc15,,,  about the importance of life insurance
wVcxAhbeMWc15,,,  of Disability Insurance with health
wVcxAhbeMWc15,,,  insurance and they said if you would
wVcxAhbeMWc15,,,  imagine just vow that your family ha
wVcxAhbeMWc16,3.36,3.46,  perhaps it 's an heirloom you would n't
wVcxAhbeMWc16,,,  ship it off across the country in a
wVcxAhbeMWc16,,,  cardboard box without first wrapping it
wVcxAhbeMWc16,,,  in bubble wrap
wVcxAhbeMWc16,,,  he said insurance is like bubble wrap
wVcxAhbeMWc16,,,  you take something very precious your
wVcxAhbeMWc18,3.48,4.09,  life your health your future and you
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  wrap it up in something very protective
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  so that when you send it off it 's safe
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  so think again what are the image that
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  you can use to incorporate into your
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  presentation to communicate a complex
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  concept so that your audience will
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  recognize it remember it and most
wVcxAhbeMWc18,,,  importantly repeat it to others

Q5WT2vweFRY4,,,  actually read them the brain is a self
Q5WT2vweFRY4,,,  organizing mechanism if you use slide
Q5WT2vweFRY4,,,  like these you 're sending a signal
Q5WT2vweFRY4,,,  directly to the audience to start
Q5WT2vweFRY4,,,  daydreaming your slide are not your
Q5WT2vweFRY5,1.08,1.26,  speaker note use powerful image and
Q5WT2vweFRY5,,,  picture they are much more effective in
Q5WT2vweFRY5,,,  getting your message across number three
Q5WT2vweFRY5,,,  keep it simple le really is more get
Q5WT2vweFRY5,,,  used to cutting out material including
Q5WT2vweFRY5,,,  your presentation only what really
Q5WT2vweFRY6,1.28,1.41,  matter this is a difficult process but
Q5WT2vweFRY6,,,  think back to point one what do you want
Q5WT2vweFRY6,,,  the audience to think feel and do if
Q5WT2vweFRY6,,,  your content doe n't match your answer
Q5WT2vweFRY6,,,  to these question cut it out
Q5WT2vweFRY6,,,  use the same language that you 'd use
Q5WT2vweFRY7,1.44,1.55,  while explaining your presentation to a
Q5WT2vweFRY7,,,  friend in the local pub over a pint and
Q5WT2vweFRY7,,,  try to use simple wording to to make
Q5WT2vweFRY7,,,  your content clear and easy to
Q5WT2vweFRY7,,,  understand
Q5WT2vweFRY7,,,  rule of three can be really effective
Q5WT2vweFRY8,1.59,2.12,  number four rehearse always always
Q5WT2vweFRY8,,,  rehearse the biggest single difference a
Q5WT2vweFRY8,,,  presenter can make to their performance
Q5WT2vweFRY8,,,  is to stand up in front of the bathroom
Q5WT2vweFRY8,,,  mirror
Q5WT2vweFRY8,,,  amra her
Q5WT2vweFRY9,2.13,2.28,  if you are serious about success then
Q5WT2vweFRY9,,,  you need to get serious about rehearsing
Q5WT2vweFRY9,,,  and if you do n't prepare them prepare to
Q5WT2vweFRY9,,,  fail number five is especially important
Q5WT2vweFRY9,,,  if you 're speaking at an event or away
Q5WT2vweFRY9,,,  from your usual place of work make
Q5WT2vweFRY10,2.31,2.44,  friend with the crew and the people at
Q5WT2vweFRY10,,,  the venue the crew can play a huge part
Q5WT2vweFRY10,,,  in your success and if you are rude and
Q5WT2vweFRY10,,,  arrogant they 'll enjoy watching you fail
Q5WT2vweFRY10,,,  get there early
Q5WT2vweFRY10,,,  make friend with them learn their name
Q5WT2vweFRY11,2.46,2.58,  and ask them for help and advice ask
Q5WT2vweFRY11,,,  politely for a sound check
Q5WT2vweFRY11,,,  ask to view your PowerPoint slide on
Q5WT2vweFRY11,,,  the big screen you can see where I 'm
Q5WT2vweFRY11,,,  going with this this preparation will
Q5WT2vweFRY11,,,  ease your nerve and raise your
Q5WT2vweFRY12,3,3.16,  confidence before your presentation
Q5WT2vweFRY12,,,  start number six now this is a much
Q5WT2vweFRY12,,,  debated point but we always say dress to
Q5WT2vweFRY12,,,  impress if you are in any doubt about
Q5WT2vweFRY12,,,  what to wear be smart smart hair smart
Q5WT2vweFRY12,,,  shoe smart dress sense do n't fall into
Q5WT2vweFRY13,3.2,3.34,  the trap of getting up on stage looking
Q5WT2vweFRY13,,,  casual because you 'll only look scruffy
Q5WT2vweFRY13,,,  if it 's smart casual dress wear always
Q5WT2vweFRY13,,,  go the smarter side of casual better for
Q5WT2vweFRY13,,,  people to say wow she look smart rather
Q5WT2vweFRY13,,,  than God she could have made an effort
Q5WT2vweFRY14,3.37,3.48,  number seven
Q5WT2vweFRY14,,,  make friend with yourself and be
Q5WT2vweFRY14,,,  comfortable
Q5WT2vweFRY14,,,  do n't create a Pasha version of the real
Q5WT2vweFRY14,,,  you someone who us big word and try
Q5WT2vweFRY14,,,  to disguise a regional accent you are
Q5WT2vweFRY15,3.52,4.09,  unique you are special nobody is quite
Q5WT2vweFRY15,,,  like you so stick to the real you be
Q5WT2vweFRY15,,,  authentic and the audience will believe
Q5WT2vweFRY15,,,  in you number eight stand still everyone
Q5WT2vweFRY15,,,  feel a rush of adrenaline a they stand
Q5WT2vweFRY15,,,  up ready to speak in front of an
Q5WT2vweFRY16,4.11,4.25,  audience a adrenaline flow through the
Q5WT2vweFRY16,,,  body your body will get ready for fight
Q5WT2vweFRY16,,,  or flight the lactic acid build up in
Q5WT2vweFRY16,,,  your muscle tissue and you will feel an
Q5WT2vweFRY16,,,  overwhelming need to move this is what
Q5WT2vweFRY16,,,  we call we
Q5WT2vweFRY17,4.26,4.42,  moving an advanced stage of weaving is
Q5WT2vweFRY17,,,  prowling from one end of the stage to
Q5WT2vweFRY17,,,  the other lock out your hip and imagine
Q5WT2vweFRY17,,,  that your foot are stuck to the floor
Q5WT2vweFRY17,,,  you still have plenty of room to move

Q5WT2vweFRY19,,,  the audience will remember a story that
Q5WT2vweFRY19,,,  relates to your key message rather than
Q5WT2vweFRY19,,,  a barrage load of slide the final point

Q5WT2vweFRY22,,,  we 'd love to hear from you
T-dbUrluW0M1,0.01,0.15,  the third thing you can do is to
T-dbUrluW0M1,,,  practice your delivery so what doe that
T-dbUrluW0M1,,,  mean practice your delivery so you 've
T-dbUrluW0M1,,,  got your content right so you 've got
T-dbUrluW0M1,,,  your knowledge you know something you 've
T-dbUrluW0M1,,,  worked on organizing it around a message
T-dbUrluW0M2,0.18,0.29,  you 've worked on putting the
T-dbUrluW0M2,,,  storytelling element in now we 're going
T-dbUrluW0M2,,,  to the communication piece so you 're
T-dbUrluW0M2,,,  going to practice your delivery so that
T-dbUrluW0M2,,,  you communicate the message you want to
T-dbUrluW0M2,,,  communicate I 'm a big believer in the
T-dbUrluW0M3,0.32,0.49,  concept of a dress rehearsal so we want
T-dbUrluW0M3,,,  to again borrow that concept of dress
T-dbUrluW0M3,,,  rehearsal and apply it here two
T-dbUrluW0M3,,,  presentation so if you are presenting
T-dbUrluW0M3,,,  to a new audience in a new location with
T-dbUrluW0M3,,,  new content you need a dress rehearsal
T-dbUrluW0M4,0.51,1.02,  or you ca n't just walk in cold and say
T-dbUrluW0M4,,,  oh yeah I 'm going to talk to this
T-dbUrluW0M4,,,  project that I just got put on yesterday
T-dbUrluW0M4,,,  I do n't really not familiar with it and
T-dbUrluW0M4,,,  I 'm in this new office location so I 'm
T-dbUrluW0M4,,,  not quite sure where the office is in
T-dbUrluW0M5,1.03,1.12,  the building I do n't know what room it 's
T-dbUrluW0M5,,,  in and I do n't know if I 'm going to have
T-dbUrluW0M5,,,  slide or if the projector in the
T-dbUrluW0M5,,,  ceiling or if I 'm going to stand here
T-dbUrluW0M5,,,  and it 's a big room should I have a mic
T-dbUrluW0M5,,,  you ca n't walk in cold and be successful
T-dbUrluW0M6,1.15,1.28,  it 's very difficult to just walk in cold
T-dbUrluW0M6,,,  to a completely new environment be
T-dbUrluW0M6,,,  successful so the concept of a dress
T-dbUrluW0M6,,,  rehearsal can help you want to actually
T-dbUrluW0M6,,,  stand up and say the word out loud in
T-dbUrluW0M6,,,  a real a situation a possible so if
T-dbUrluW0M7,1.31,1.4,  you 're going to be in a conference room
T-dbUrluW0M7,,,  is their conference room you can
T-dbUrluW0M7,,,  practice in if suddenly you have to be
T-dbUrluW0M7,,,  at a conference or an association
T-dbUrluW0M7,,,  meeting and you 've got a dress in a suit
T-dbUrluW0M7,,,  and tie and normally you wear jean and
T-dbUrluW0M8,1.43,1.51,  a t to work but now you 're going
T-dbUrluW0M8,,,  to present in a suit and tie if you 're
T-dbUrluW0M8,,,  not used to wearing a suit and tie
T-dbUrluW0M8,,,  that 's going to be really uncomfortable
T-dbUrluW0M8,,,  that first time you can be fidgeting
T-dbUrluW0M8,,,  with it and you know caught it doing all
T-dbUrluW0M9,1.53,2.05,  this and you 're going to lose the focus
T-dbUrluW0M9,,,  and distract the audience so practicing
T-dbUrluW0M9,,,  a real a situation a possible
T-dbUrluW0M9,,,  particularly if there are new element
T-dbUrluW0M9,,,  sometimes we practice how we look at the
T-dbUrluW0M9,,,  computer we run our slide we just look
T-dbUrluW0M10,2.11,2.19,  at the computer we run our slide in our
T-dbUrluW0M10,,,  head and we do maybe maybe we 're
T-dbUrluW0M10,,,  talking
T-dbUrluW0M10,,,  our head it 's not effective because I
T-dbUrluW0M10,,,  can look at my slide and have the
T-dbUrluW0M10,,,  greatest story in my head but when I
T-dbUrluW0M11,2.22,2.35,  actually have to make it go from the
T-dbUrluW0M11,,,  brain to the mouth and come out a
T-dbUrluW0M11,,,  coherent it 's hard because where do we
T-dbUrluW0M11,,,  get tripped up we get tripped up on the
T-dbUrluW0M11,,,  transition well now I 'm going to talk
T-dbUrluW0M11,,,  about right and if you 've got a lot of
T-dbUrluW0M12,2.37,2.46,  slide and you 're transitioning you get
T-dbUrluW0M12,,,  tripped up because you have n't practiced
T-dbUrluW0M12,,,  that because that 's not really part of
T-dbUrluW0M12,,,  the story in your head but if you were
T-dbUrluW0M12,,,  to stand in your office close the door
T-dbUrluW0M12,,,  if you have one if not bathroom are
T-dbUrluW0M13,2.48,2.59,  always a good place to practice if it 's
T-dbUrluW0M13,,,  the only place that you know you can get
T-dbUrluW0M13,,,  a cubicle with a door stand up and you
T-dbUrluW0M13,,,  know stand up and practice see the word
T-dbUrluW0M13,,,  out loud see if you can figure out how
T-dbUrluW0M13,,,  it 's going to come out especially your
T-dbUrluW0M14,3.01,3.1,  first couple of sentence where you
T-dbUrluW0M14,,,  introduce your message a first couple
T-dbUrluW0M14,,,  of sentence are so key because they
T-dbUrluW0M14,,,  help you get off on the right foot they
T-dbUrluW0M14,,,  help you relax if you 're nervous and
T-dbUrluW0M14,,,  they help key to the audience what
T-dbUrluW0M15,3.13,3.25,  you 're going to be talking about so even
T-dbUrluW0M15,,,  just practice that part and your
T-dbUrluW0M15,,,  transition and the conclusion because
T-dbUrluW0M15,,,  then you 're anchoring the presentation
T-dbUrluW0M15,,,  now people say well I 've got to talk for
T-dbUrluW0M15,,,  an hour I 'm not going to stand up and do
T-dbUrluW0M16,3.26,3.38,  a full hour dress rehearsal I do n't know
T-dbUrluW0M16,,,  depends I 've done it if it 's important
T-dbUrluW0M16,,,  enough if you 're motivated enough and if
T-dbUrluW0M16,,,  you have the time it would be very
T-dbUrluW0M16,,,  helpful especially again if it 's new
T-dbUrluW0M16,,,  material if you 've given the same
T-dbUrluW0M17,3.4,3.51,  presentation every week for month okay
T-dbUrluW0M17,,,  you do n't need a full hour dress
T-dbUrluW0M17,,,  rehearsal but if it 's new stuff and the
T-dbUrluW0M17,,,  stake are high you 're in front of a new
T-dbUrluW0M17,,,  audience dress rehearsal play and
T-dbUrluW0M17,,,  musical and performance use it for a
T-dbUrluW0M19,3.53,4.07,  reason because that 's where we figure
T-dbUrluW0M19,,,  out what thing are going to go wrong
T-dbUrluW0M19,,,  and we 're more comfortable in that so it
T-dbUrluW0M19,,,  encouraged you to apply this concept of
T-dbUrluW0M19,,,  dress rehearsal to the presentation
T-dbUrluW0M19,,,  you have to give particularly with new
T-dbUrluW0M19,,,  stuff particularly if the stake are
T-dbUrluW0M19,,,  high
oSZfqCBUpOs1,0,0.1,   An initial public offering
oSZfqCBUpOs1,,,  when a successful private company
oSZfqCBUpOs1,,,  decides to offer share to the public
oSZfqCBUpOs1,,,  is an exciting time for the company
oSZfqCBUpOs1,,,  it original shareholder and the investing public .
oSZfqCBUpOs1,,,  All of the excitement and publicity around an IPO
oSZfqCBUpOs2,0.13,0.27,  often lead investor to want to get in on the action .
oSZfqCBUpOs2,,,  If you can get in on the ground floor of an IPO
oSZfqCBUpOs2,,,  that is get an allocation in the initial share offering
oSZfqCBUpOs2,,,  before the stock start trading
oSZfqCBUpOs2,,,  there is evidence that you are likely to make a profit .
oSZfqCBUpOs2,,,  IPOs tend to be underpriced .
oSZfqCBUpOs3,0.3,0.41,  While this might seem like an obvious way to easy profit
oSZfqCBUpOs3,,,  there are a few crucially important thing
oSZfqCBUpOs3,,,  for you to consider .
oSZfqCBUpOs3,,,  I 'm Ben Felix Portfolio Manager at PWL Capital .
oSZfqCBUpOs3,,,  In this episode of Common Sense Investing
oSZfqCBUpOs3,,,  I 'm going to tell you why IPOs do n't live up to the hype .
oSZfqCBUpOs4,0.45,1,  ( driving electronic music )
oSZfqCBUpOs4,,,  It is well that IPOs tend to be underpriced .
oSZfqCBUpOs4,,,  In other word when the underwriter determines the price
oSZfqCBUpOs4,,,  that the company should offer it share to the public
oSZfqCBUpOs4,,,  the data show that they tend to set a price
oSZfqCBUpOs4,,,  below where the market will price the share .
oSZfqCBUpOs5,1.03,1.14,  This creates the perception
oSZfqCBUpOs5,,,  of a real opportunity for investor
oSZfqCBUpOs5,,,  to make a quick profit on the first day of an IPO .
oSZfqCBUpOs5,,,  The medium often enjoy reporting
oSZfqCBUpOs5,,,  on the large first profit that IPO investor make .
oSZfqCBUpOs5,,,  The challenge for most investor though
oSZfqCBUpOs6,1.17,1.28,  is that getting in on the initial allocation is really hard .
oSZfqCBUpOs6,,,  The majority of the initial allocation
oSZfqCBUpOs6,,,  generally go to institutional investor
oSZfqCBUpOs6,,,  which we will touch on again in a minute
oSZfqCBUpOs6,,,  while the allotment for retail investor
oSZfqCBUpOs6,,,  is likely to be allocated to larger brokerage client .
oSZfqCBUpOs7,1.32,1.45,  Fidelity describes the allocation process
oSZfqCBUpOs7,,,  for retail investor a follows .
oSZfqCBUpOs7,,,  Each customer who want to participate in an IPO offering
oSZfqCBUpOs7,,,  is evaluated and ranked based on his or her asset
oSZfqCBUpOs7,,,  and the revenue they generate for the brokerage firm .
oSZfqCBUpOs7,,,  Typically customer with significant
oSZfqCBUpOs8,1.47,1.59,  long relationship with their brokerage firm
oSZfqCBUpOs8,,,  will receive higher priority
oSZfqCBUpOs8,,,  than those with smaller or new relationship .
oSZfqCBUpOs8,,,  This statement from Fidelity is supported
oSZfqCBUpOs8,,,  by a 2018 paper in the Journal of Fice titled
oSZfqCBUpOs8,,,  `` Quid Pro Quo ?
oSZfqCBUpOs9,2,2.15,  What Factors Influence IPO Allocations to Investors ? ``
oSZfqCBUpOs9,,,  where the author examined 220 IPOs
oSZfqCBUpOs9,,,  from January 2010 through May 2015
oSZfqCBUpOs9,,,  to test the determit of IPO allocation .
oSZfqCBUpOs9,,,  They found strong support
oSZfqCBUpOs9,,,  for the brokerage revenue associated with a client
oSZfqCBUpOs10,2.18,2.28,  being a significant determit
oSZfqCBUpOs10,,,  of investor ' IPO allocation and profit .
oSZfqCBUpOs10,,,  Based on this if you are able
oSZfqCBUpOs10,,,  to get in on an initial allocation
oSZfqCBUpOs10,,,  unless you 're a high value brokerage client
oSZfqCBUpOs10,,,  or an institution
oSZfqCBUpOs11,2.3,2.43,  you 're likely getting in on an IPO
oSZfqCBUpOs11,,,  with a poor expected outcome .
oSZfqCBUpOs11,,,  There is adverse selection in IPO allotment
oSZfqCBUpOs11,,,  where those with expected weak first return
oSZfqCBUpOs11,,,  have been easier to get access to ahead of time .
oSZfqCBUpOs11,,,  I think it 's safe to say that in general
oSZfqCBUpOs12,2.45,2.56,  smaller retail investor and DIY investor
oSZfqCBUpOs12,,,  who are not generating significant revenue
oSZfqCBUpOs12,,,  for their brokerage firm
oSZfqCBUpOs12,,,  will be hard pressed to get in on the initial allocation
oSZfqCBUpOs12,,,  when a hot company go public .
oSZfqCBUpOs12,,,  Interestingly there is evidence that new mutual fund
oSZfqCBUpOs13,3,3.12,  use their institutional status and relationship
oSZfqCBUpOs13,,,  to get in on initial IPO allocation
oSZfqCBUpOs13,,,  in an effort to boost their return .
oSZfqCBUpOs13,,,  This wa detailed in a 2017 paper
oSZfqCBUpOs13,,,  `` IPO Allocations and New Mutual Funds ''
oSZfqCBUpOs13,,,  by Frankie Chau Yi Gu and Christodoulos Louca .
oSZfqCBUpOs14,3.16,3.3,  They looked at data from 1998 to 2015
oSZfqCBUpOs14,,,  and found that new mutual fund tend to outperform
oSZfqCBUpOs14,,,  during the first six month after inception .
oSZfqCBUpOs14,,,  This outperformance wa concentrated
oSZfqCBUpOs14,,,  in new fund that held underpriced IPO stock .
oSZfqCBUpOs14,,,  After the first six month performance fell substantially .
oSZfqCBUpOs15,3.33,3.44,  The suggestion in the paper
oSZfqCBUpOs15,,,  is that a fund company might choose to allocate
oSZfqCBUpOs15,,,  all of their IPO allotment to a new fund
oSZfqCBUpOs15,,,  in an effort to boost it performance
oSZfqCBUpOs15,,,  to attract new investor .
oSZfqCBUpOs15,,,  While this work to get an initial boost
oSZfqCBUpOs16,3.45,3.55,  the fund performance tends to drop off quickly .
oSZfqCBUpOs16,,,  The reason that this information
oSZfqCBUpOs16,,,  is relevant to our discussion
oSZfqCBUpOs16,,,  is that it show the level of competition
oSZfqCBUpOs16,,,  for initial IPO allotment .
oSZfqCBUpOs16,,,  I would n't take this a a signal
oSZfqCBUpOs17,3.57,4.08,  that all new mutual fund will perform well .
oSZfqCBUpOs17,,,  Keep in mind it is easy to identify the fund
oSZfqCBUpOs17,,,  receiving preferential IPO allocation after the fact
oSZfqCBUpOs17,,,  but I would n't start speculating on new mutual fund
oSZfqCBUpOs17,,,  in an effort to profit from this phenomenon .
oSZfqCBUpOs17,,,  All right so you 're probably not going to get in
oSZfqCBUpOs18,4.11,4.22,  on the initial allocation when a company go public
oSZfqCBUpOs18,,,  but that doe n't mean that you ca n't buy share
oSZfqCBUpOs18,,,  on the first day of trading .
oSZfqCBUpOs18,,,  Once the share are listed on a stock exchange
oSZfqCBUpOs18,,,  many of the people holding the share
oSZfqCBUpOs18,,,  will want to realize the profit
oSZfqCBUpOs19,4.23,4.35,  from the likely underpriced IPO
oSZfqCBUpOs19,,,  and you could be the one to buy them .
oSZfqCBUpOs19,,,  The performance of IPOs after the first day of trading
oSZfqCBUpOs19,,,  ha also been studied extensively .
oSZfqCBUpOs19,,,  In the March 2017 paper
oSZfqCBUpOs19,,,  `` The Long Performance of IPOs Revisited ''
oSZfqCBUpOs20,4.38,4.55,  Daniel Hoechle Larissa Karthaus and Markus Schmid
oSZfqCBUpOs20,,,  detailed the performance of US IPOs between 1975 and 2014 .
oSZfqCBUpOs20,,,  They looked at a total of 7
oSZfqCBUpOs20,,,  over time period ranging from one to 40 quarter
oSZfqCBUpOs20,,,  after the first trading day .
oSZfqCBUpOs20,,,  They found that IPO firm tended to behave
oSZfqCBUpOs21,4.58,5.09,  like high beta stock
oSZfqCBUpOs21,,,  with negative loading to the value factor
oSZfqCBUpOs21,,,  and that they underperform for the first two year
oSZfqCBUpOs21,,,  even when common risk factor
oSZfqCBUpOs21,,,  like size relative price and momentum are accounted for .
oSZfqCBUpOs21,,,  This underperformance gradually decline
oSZfqCBUpOs22,5.11,5.24,  with longer time period
oSZfqCBUpOs22,,,  becoming statistically insignificant after two year .
oSZfqCBUpOs22,,,  In summary of their paper
oSZfqCBUpOs22,,,  IPO firm have unfavorable exposure to risk factor
oSZfqCBUpOs22,,,  with high beta and negative loading to value
oSZfqCBUpOs22,,,  but even when those are accounted for
oSZfqCBUpOs23,5.26,5.44,  IPO firm tend to underperform for the first two year .
oSZfqCBUpOs23,,,  These finding are also supported by more recent research .
oSZfqCBUpOs23,,,  In a 2019 paper from Dimensional Fund Advisors
oSZfqCBUpOs23,,,  the author examined 6
oSZfqCBUpOs23,,,  between January 1991 and December 2018 .
oSZfqCBUpOs23,,,  To evaluate IPO performance a a whole
oSZfqCBUpOs24,5.46,5.57,  they constructed a hypothetical
oSZfqCBUpOs24,,,  market weighted portfolio of IPOs
oSZfqCBUpOs24,,,  issued over the preceding 12 period
oSZfqCBUpOs24,,,  and rebalanced monthly .
oSZfqCBUpOs24,,,  They excluded first return from the analysis .
oSZfqCBUpOs24,,,  They found that over the full sample period
oSZfqCBUpOs25,5.59,6.19,  the IPO portfolio delivered a return of 6.93 %
oSZfqCBUpOs25,,,  with a standard deviation of 27.62 %
oSZfqCBUpOs25,,,  while the Russell 3000 Index a US total market index
oSZfqCBUpOs25,,,  delivered a 9.13 % return with a 14.28 % standard deviation .
oSZfqCBUpOs25,,,  They also split the full sample period into two sub
oSZfqCBUpOs25,,,  with one ending in the year 2000
oSZfqCBUpOs26,6.21,6.33,  to isolate the high volume of IPOs over that time period .
oSZfqCBUpOs26,,,  The result for both sub
oSZfqCBUpOs26,,,  before and after the year 2000
oSZfqCBUpOs26,,,  exhibited underperformance relative to the market
oSZfqCBUpOs26,,,  with substantially more risk
oSZfqCBUpOs26,,,  a measured by the standard deviation of return .
oSZfqCBUpOs27,6.36,6.46,  This result corroborates the finding
oSZfqCBUpOs27,,,  of Hoechle Karthaus and Schmid
oSZfqCBUpOs27,,,  who found that IPOs perform poorly over the first two year .
oSZfqCBUpOs27,,,  The Dimensional paper also applied
oSZfqCBUpOs27,,,  the Fama/French five model
oSZfqCBUpOs27,,,  to the IPO portfolio ' return
oSZfqCBUpOs28,6.49,7.01,  and found that the return are well explained
oSZfqCBUpOs28,,,  by the factor in the model
oSZfqCBUpOs28,,,  market beta company size relative price
oSZfqCBUpOs28,,,  profitability and investment .
oSZfqCBUpOs28,,,  This suggests that IPO firm a a group
oSZfqCBUpOs28,,,  have behaved like small cap growth stock
oSZfqCBUpOs29,7.03,7.15,  with weak profitability that invest aggressively .
oSZfqCBUpOs29,,,  These type of stock whether they are recent IPOs or not
oSZfqCBUpOs29,,,  tend to underperform the market .
oSZfqCBUpOs29,,,  What we can conclude from the research
oSZfqCBUpOs29,,,  that we have discussed in this video is that
oSZfqCBUpOs29,,,  if you want to make money from IPOs
oSZfqCBUpOs30,7.17,7.31,  you have to get in on the initial allocation
oSZfqCBUpOs30,,,  but doing so especially for hot IPOs
oSZfqCBUpOs30,,,  is really unlikely unless you are considered
oSZfqCBUpOs30,,,  a highly valued client by your brokerage .
oSZfqCBUpOs30,,,  If you are able to get in on the initial allocation
oSZfqCBUpOs30,,,  there 's a good chance that it 's not an IPO
oSZfqCBUpOs31,7.33,7.45,  that will have a big first pop .
oSZfqCBUpOs31,,,  The better the expected pop
oSZfqCBUpOs31,,,  the more likely the IPO share will be allotted
oSZfqCBUpOs31,,,  to institution and the largest retail client .
oSZfqCBUpOs31,,,  If you miss out on the initial allocation
oSZfqCBUpOs31,,,  and instead buy the share on the secondary market
oSZfqCBUpOs32,7.47,7.58,  once they 've started trading
oSZfqCBUpOs32,,,  you 're buying into share that will likely perform
oSZfqCBUpOs32,,,  like a small growth low profitability
oSZfqCBUpOs32,,,  high investment firm
oSZfqCBUpOs32,,,  which have an unattractive risk/return profile .
oSZfqCBUpOs32,,,  Even beyond that let 's keep in mind that
oSZfqCBUpOs33,8,8.11,  any time that you buy one stock
oSZfqCBUpOs33,,,  you probably are n't going to get the return
oSZfqCBUpOs33,,,  of the asset class that it belongs to .
oSZfqCBUpOs33,,,  On average a secondary market IPO investment
oSZfqCBUpOs33,,,  will give you the poor expected outcome
oSZfqCBUpOs33,,,  of small growth low profitability high investment stock .
oSZfqCBUpOs34,8.15,8.27,  But unless you are building
oSZfqCBUpOs34,,,  a diversified portfolio of recent IPO stock
oSZfqCBUpOs34,,,  your actual outcome on an individual stock investment
oSZfqCBUpOs34,,,  will be driven by the specific risk of the company
oSZfqCBUpOs34,,,  which delivers a random outcome .

El2bHe0GuZQ1,0.03,0.14, now that you've done all the necessary
El2bHe0GuZQ1,,, preparation you need to deliver your
El2bHe0GuZQ1,,, presentation the style and methods of
El2bHe0GuZQ1,,, delivery you use in your presentation
El2bHe0GuZQ1,,, will play a big role in its success
El2bHe0GuZQ1,,, every presentation should aim not only
El2bHe0GuZQ2,0.17,0.28, to close sales but to build and improve
El2bHe0GuZQ2,,, the long-term relationship with your
El2bHe0GuZQ2,,, audience here are four principles to
El2bHe0GuZQ2,,, consider when delivering to make sure
El2bHe0GuZQ2,,, that your presentation is engaging for
El2bHe0GuZQ2,,, the audience principle number one use
El2bHe0GuZQ3,0.32,0.44, strong and open body language this means
El2bHe0GuZQ3,,, standing up straight with your shoulders
El2bHe0GuZQ3,,, back looking the customer in the eye and
El2bHe0GuZQ3,,, smiling it's extremely important that
El2bHe0GuZQ3,,, you come across this self-assured
El2bHe0GuZQ3,,, friendly and approachable to the
El2bHe0GuZQ4,0.46,0.57, customer in part a relaxed and confident
El2bHe0GuZQ4,,, approach is something that comes with
El2bHe0GuZQ4,,, time as you gain experience but you can
El2bHe0GuZQ4,,, still consciously adjust your body
El2bHe0GuZQ4,,, language to create a more positive
El2bHe0GuZQ4,,, impression even if the customer is aware
El2bHe0GuZQ5,1,1.12, that you are a bit nervous they'll
El2bHe0GuZQ5,,, appreciate and respect the fact that
El2bHe0GuZQ5,,, you're doing your best for them
El2bHe0GuZQ5,,, principle number two use visual aids
El2bHe0GuZQ5,,, make sure that your use of visual aids
El2bHe0GuZQ5,,, is skilled and smooth and not excessive
El2bHe0GuZQ6,1.15,1.28, remember that a picture speaks a
El2bHe0GuZQ6,,, thousand words using visual aids will
El2bHe0GuZQ6,,, make things clearer and will also free
El2bHe0GuZQ6,,, up a significant amount of time that you
El2bHe0GuZQ6,,, do I have to spend explaining this time
El2bHe0GuZQ6,,, is better spent interacting with your
El2bHe0GuZQ7,1.29,1.4, audience and responding to their
El2bHe0GuZQ7,,, specific needs
El2bHe0GuZQ7,,, principle number three know your role
El2bHe0GuZQ7,,, this really applies when you're
El2bHe0GuZQ7,,, delivering as part of a team make sure
El2bHe0GuZQ7,,, that all members know their role you
El2bHe0GuZQ8,1.42,1.53, might be conducting a presentation in
El2bHe0GuZQ8,,, which one person is covering product
El2bHe0GuZQ8,,, benefits someone else is covering the
El2bHe0GuZQ8,,, company history and yet another person
El2bHe0GuZQ8,,, is conducting a product demonstration
El2bHe0GuZQ8,,, what order will you speak in who is
El2bHe0GuZQ9,1.56,2.08, covering what you need to make sure that
El2bHe0GuZQ9,,, you don't duplicate the same material in
El2bHe0GuZQ9,,, your presentation eliminate any
El2bHe0GuZQ9,,, awkwardness and confusion that could
El2bHe0GuZQ9,,, arise from mix ups and misunderstandings
El2bHe0GuZQ9,,, by ensuring that each member of the team
El2bHe0GuZQ10,2.1,2.22, knows exactly what's expected of them
El2bHe0GuZQ10,,, and principle number four
El2bHe0GuZQ10,,, get the customer involved a good
El2bHe0GuZQ10,,, presentation is actually a dialogue
El2bHe0GuZQ10,,, between the presenter and the audience
El2bHe0GuZQ10,,, even during the parts of your
El2bHe0GuZQ11,2.24,2.34, presentation which are pre-planned keep
El2bHe0GuZQ11,,, a watchful eye on the nonverbal
El2bHe0GuZQ11,,, responses and body language of your
El2bHe0GuZQ11,,, audience
El2bHe0GuZQ11,,, if you sense disagreement or confusion
El2bHe0GuZQ11,,, consider stopping your flow momentarily
El2bHe0GuZQ12,2.37,2.49, to check for misunderstandings if you
El2bHe0GuZQ12,,, just keep going the audience may tune
El2bHe0GuZQ12,,, out of what you're saying whatever
El2bHe0GuZQ12,,, choice you make always seek to maximize
El2bHe0GuZQ12,,, the involvement and engagement of the
El2bHe0GuZQ12,,, audience some delivery approaches really
El2bHe0GuZQ14,2.52,3.08, encourage interaction for example a
El2bHe0GuZQ14,,, common technique is to consult the
El2bHe0GuZQ14,,, customer on an important issue taking
El2bHe0GuZQ14,,, notes on a whiteboard or flip chart this
El2bHe0GuZQ14,,, involves the customer and shows you
El2bHe0GuZQ14,,, understand their perspective later you
El2bHe0GuZQ14,,, can present your products and services
El2bHe0GuZQ14,,, as the solution to this problem
9IEys7g2YFc1,0.05,0.17, hello there and welcome to improve your
9IEys7g2YFc1,,, voice my name is Darren McStay and today
9IEys7g2YFc1,,, we're going to talk about learning to
9IEys7g2YFc1,,, speak more clearly through daily
9IEys7g2YFc1,,, practice so every time I get a message
9IEys7g2YFc1,,, relating to how someone can improve
9IEys7g2YFc2,0.19,0.3, their voice it's often followed by the
9IEys7g2YFc2,,, assumption that they can get this
9IEys7g2YFc2,,, quickly laughs it's a quick fix of how
9IEys7g2YFc2,,, to get this done unfortunately with the
9IEys7g2YFc2,,, voice it doesn't really work like that
9IEys7g2YFc2,,, your voice is created by your body using
9IEys7g2YFc3,0.34,0.47, air manipulated accordingly through
9IEys7g2YFc3,,, intentions and impulses created by the
9IEys7g2YFc3,,, mind your body is a physiological
9IEys7g2YFc3,,, machine it is an instrument made of
9IEys7g2YFc3,,, muscle bone fasciae and many other bits
9IEys7g2YFc3,,, and bobs thrown in if you want to train
9IEys7g2YFc4,0.49,1.01, this instrument to perform better then
9IEys7g2YFc4,,, you are no different to an athlete who
9IEys7g2YFc4,,, also has to train their body only we're
9IEys7g2YFc4,,, training our bodies in different ways
9IEys7g2YFc4,,, and of course we all know that the
9IEys7g2YFc4,,, smarter an athlete works and the more
9IEys7g2YFc5,1.04,1.13, consistent they are with their work the
9IEys7g2YFc5,,, better they become this means that if
9IEys7g2YFc5,,, you want to create permanent and
9IEys7g2YFc5,,, positive results which will ensure your
9IEys7g2YFc5,,, instrument can function to the best of
9IEys7g2YFc5,,, its ability then you need to think and
9IEys7g2YFc6,1.15,1.27, train like an athlete okay not by using
9IEys7g2YFc6,,, the same muscles the same way as an
9IEys7g2YFc6,,, athlete but you need to practice
9IEys7g2YFc6,,, regularly and dare I say it daily do you
9IEys7g2YFc6,,, want to get better practice daily want
9IEys7g2YFc6,,, to stop mumbling practice daily
9IEys7g2YFc7,1.29,1.41, improve your confidence practice daily
9IEys7g2YFc7,,, articulate better resonate more become
9IEys7g2YFc7,,, more present practice daily but most
9IEys7g2YFc7,,, importantly and according to the way
9IEys7g2YFc7,,, this video is titled if you want to be
9IEys7g2YFc7,,, clearer and better understood then you
9IEys7g2YFc8,1.43,1.55, need to practice speaking clearer daily
9IEys7g2YFc8,,, so it's all very well taking the
9IEys7g2YFc8,,, exercises from my channel and also for
9IEys7g2YFc8,,, my online course which are designed to
9IEys7g2YFc8,,, make your instrument the best it can be
9IEys7g2YFc8,,, but if you're not practicing using that
9IEys7g2YFc9,1.57,2.08, instrument it's just going to start
9IEys7g2YFc9,,, getting a bit rusty and a bit dusty so
9IEys7g2YFc9,,, even though it's a good instrument
9IEys7g2YFc9,,, innocent good shape it still needs to be
9IEys7g2YFc9,,, played and what I mean by that is to
9IEys7g2YFc9,,, become more mindful and more purposeful
9IEys7g2YFc10,2.11,2.21, with how you speak daily so in order for
9IEys7g2YFc10,,, you to learn
9IEys7g2YFc10,,, and to understand and start practicing
9IEys7g2YFc10,,, speaking more clearly daily I'm going to
9IEys7g2YFc10,,, set you a task now which you can start
9IEys7g2YFc10,,, once this video is complete I want you
9IEys7g2YFc11,2.23,2.38, to go and find someone whose voice you
9IEys7g2YFc11,,, like now this could be a TV personality
9IEys7g2YFc11,,, a newsreader an actor politician anyone
9IEys7g2YFc11,,, that you know whose voice you can find
9IEys7g2YFc11,,, in many places beyond films radio
9IEys7g2YFc11,,, cassette recordings or anywhere you can
9IEys7g2YFc12,2.4,2.5, find it on the Internet is a great
9IEys7g2YFc12,,, source of material of course find
9IEys7g2YFc12,,, someone whose voice you would like to
9IEys7g2YFc12,,, sound a bit like and what I want you to
9IEys7g2YFc12,,, do is find the 30 to 60 seconds max
9IEys7g2YFc12,,, recording and put it on your phone or
9IEys7g2YFc13,2.53,3.04, your laptop of this person speaking and
9IEys7g2YFc13,,, what you're going to do is every day
9IEys7g2YFc13,,, you're going to play that recording back
9IEys7g2YFc13,,, listen to it stop it every few seconds
9IEys7g2YFc13,,, and repeat what that person is saying
9IEys7g2YFc13,,, exactly as you think they sound when
9IEys7g2YFc14,3.07,3.17, they say it now I think it's important
9IEys7g2YFc14,,, that you find someone who you believe to
9IEys7g2YFc14,,, be a good speaker someone you find to be
9IEys7g2YFc14,,, articulate and clear in their voice not
9IEys7g2YFc14,,, just someone you like their voice if
9IEys7g2YFc14,,, it's a singer for example if it's a
9IEys7g2YFc15,3.19,3.28, mumble rapper that's not going to get
9IEys7g2YFc15,,, you anywhere with your articulation
9IEys7g2YFc15,,, clear of speech so what you want to do
9IEys7g2YFc15,,, is find someone who maybe uses their
9IEys7g2YFc15,,, voice as a speaker for a living possibly
9IEys7g2YFc15,,, an actor or like I said before a
9IEys7g2YFc16,3.31,3.42, politician and try to notice what it is
9IEys7g2YFc16,,, that makes their voice stand out what is
9IEys7g2YFc16,,, it that makes it clear and I don't want
9IEys7g2YFc16,,, you to worry too much about this I just
9IEys7g2YFc16,,, wanted to do it every day now until you
9IEys7g2YFc16,,, can impersonate the recording you have
9IEys7g2YFc17,3.45,3.56, of this person until you can actually do
9IEys7g2YFc17,,, it the way they do it I don't need to
9IEys7g2YFc17,,, think too much about what it is they're
9IEys7g2YFc17,,, doing I just want you to mimic the
9IEys7g2YFc17,,, sounds they make and there's a reason
9IEys7g2YFc17,,, for this when we're children everything
9IEys7g2YFc18,3.57,4.08, we learn is through copying it's through
9IEys7g2YFc18,,, mimicking this is how we learn and what
9IEys7g2YFc18,,, happens is as we get older we form
9IEys7g2YFc18,,, habits which aren't necessarily so good
9IEys7g2YFc18,,, for our speech or good for our lives
9IEys7g2YFc18,,, even so what we need to do is to retrain
9IEys7g2YFc19,4.1,4.2, our bodies to start thinking and acting
9IEys7g2YFc19,,, and copying those who we now wish to
9IEys7g2YFc19,,, sound like or we now wish to become so
9IEys7g2YFc19,,, specifically with our voices find
9IEys7g2YFc19,,, someone who you want to sound like or
9IEys7g2YFc19,,, believe that has quality in their voice
9IEys7g2YFc20,4.22,4.32, that you would like to have in yours and
9IEys7g2YFc20,,, we're going to start mimicking that
9IEys7g2YFc20,,, that's how we're going to
9IEys7g2YFc20,,, so if there's a lot of words in this
9IEys7g2YFc20,,, text you can stop it every few seconds
9IEys7g2YFc20,,, and repeat after them or if it's just a
9IEys7g2YFc21,4.34,4.44, short piece of text maybe it's easy for
9IEys7g2YFc21,,, you to learn it and repeat it back and
9IEys7g2YFc21,,, once you get to the point where you can
9IEys7g2YFc21,,, remember everything that's great keep
9IEys7g2YFc21,,, doing it keep listening to the recording
9IEys7g2YFc21,,, every day until you feel you can do a
9IEys7g2YFc22,4.46,4.55, very good impersonation now the best way
9IEys7g2YFc22,,, for you to find out whether you're
9IEys7g2YFc22,,, progressing and getting better with this
9IEys7g2YFc22,,, is to record your own voice as well and
9IEys7g2YFc22,,, what you should do is if you do this
9IEys7g2YFc22,,, listening exercise daily and speak along
9IEys7g2YFc23,4.59,5.1, with it then at the end of every week
9IEys7g2YFc23,,, you can record your voice and play that
9IEys7g2YFc23,,, back against the other one and listen to
9IEys7g2YFc23,,, yourself against how you sounded the
9IEys7g2YFc23,,, week before so you can do this for two
9IEys7g2YFc23,,, weeks a month six months a year if you
9IEys7g2YFc24,5.13,5.25, like just do it until you're comfortable
9IEys7g2YFc24,,, that something in your voice has changed
9IEys7g2YFc24,,, I don't want you to do this without
9IEys7g2YFc24,,, using a warm-up or some kind of physical
9IEys7g2YFc24,,, exercises that get your body and your
9IEys7g2YFc24,,, voice ready to speak now you can do this
9IEys7g2YFc25,5.27,5.37, one of three ways I have tons of videos
9IEys7g2YFc25,,, on this channel and this one in
9IEys7g2YFc25,,, particular is a great warmup I'd like
9IEys7g2YFc25,,, you to look at that everyday before you
9IEys7g2YFc25,,, do this exercise so this way your body
9IEys7g2YFc25,,, is in a really ready state to get
9IEys7g2YFc26,5.38,5.49, started and if you feel that after doing
9IEys7g2YFc26,,, these exercises for say two weeks or a
9IEys7g2YFc26,,, month and doing these warm-up exercises
9IEys7g2YFc26,,, and the one I've set you then I think
9IEys7g2YFc26,,, you would be ready to check out the
9IEys7g2YFc26,,, online course do these exercises daily
9IEys7g2YFc27,5.51,6.02, go through all my videos find everything
9IEys7g2YFc27,,, you can practice daily
9IEys7g2YFc27,,, make something up maybe just do one
9IEys7g2YFc27,,, video a day failing that if you really
9IEys7g2YFc27,,, don't want to do these exercises and you
9IEys7g2YFc27,,, don't want to practice daily you're not
9IEys7g2YFc28,6.04,6.15, going to get as far as you want as quick
9IEys7g2YFc28,,, as you'd like of course if you want to
9IEys7g2YFc28,,, make permanent changes in your voice and
9IEys7g2YFc28,,, permanent changes positive results from
9IEys7g2YFc28,,, your instrument then you need to do a
9IEys7g2YFc28,,, very specific set of exercises which is
9IEys7g2YFc29,6.18,6.26, why I put together my eight-week online
9IEys7g2YFc29,,, course because it took me 25 years to
9IEys7g2YFc29,,, amass all that information and put it
9IEys7g2YFc29,,, together in a structured way that I
9IEys7g2YFc29,,, could teach others to literally
9IEys7g2YFc29,,, transform their bodies from where ever
9IEys7g2YFc31,6.28,6.42, they are into the ultimate speaking
9IEys7g2YFc31,,, machine but that aside you have your
9IEys7g2YFc31,,, task whether you choose to take it or
9IEys7g2YFc31,,, not it's up to you I hope you do thanks
9IEys7g2YFc31,,, for joining me my name is Darren McStay
9IEys7g2YFc31,,, this is improve your voice
9IEys7g2YFc31,,, and until the next time practice using a
9IEys7g2YFc31,,, voice
Js7-OWd19PE1,0.08,0.23, it's beautiful thank you thank you hello
Js7-OWd19PE1,,, I am going to be using this microphone
Js7-OWd19PE1,,, because there is a video happening so
Js7-OWd19PE1,,, ordinarily I would not be using the
Js7-OWd19PE1,,, microphone so i hope you can hear me
Js7-OWd19PE1,,, well i'm very very excited to be here
Js7-OWd19PE2,0.27,0.39, today that's the first thing i want to

Js7-OWd19PE2,,, you've been doing many many things in
Js7-OWd19PE2,,, your fields making your ideas happen and
Js7-OWd19PE3,0.41,0.53, one of the things I want to begin with
Js7-OWd19PE3,,, is this lee mentioned i think in his
Js7-OWd19PE3,,, introduction that one of my specialties
Js7-OWd19PE3,,, is something called improvisational
Js7-OWd19PE3,,, leadership and this is something that i
Js7-OWd19PE3,,, created over the years I've always had a
Js7-OWd19PE4,0.55,1.09, dual career where I have blended my work
Js7-OWd19PE4,,, as a consultant in organizations helping
Js7-OWd19PE4,,, organizations and leaders with executive
Js7-OWd19PE4,,, coaching as well grow their ideas
Js7-OWd19PE4,,, through their leadership effectively and
Js7-OWd19PE4,,, the leadership is something that I am
Js7-OWd19PE5,1.11,1.25, very passionate about early in my career
Js7-OWd19PE5,,, I realized that the very same skills
Js7-OWd19PE5,,, that actors use and musicians use are
Js7-OWd19PE5,,, there any people here who play music in
Js7-OWd19PE5,,, any way who are musicians yes you know
Js7-OWd19PE5,,, musicians improvise right actors
Js7-OWd19PE6,1.27,1.41, improvise and the skills that allow you
Js7-OWd19PE6,,, to do that well and to be very very
Js7-OWd19PE6,,, skilled at that are the same exact tools
Js7-OWd19PE6,,, that are needed for leaders in order to
Js7-OWd19PE6,,, be effective as influencers because
Js7-OWd19PE6,,, basically when it comes down to making a
Js7-OWd19PE7,1.43,1.57, pitch what you're doing is in that
Js7-OWd19PE7,,, moment you are the leader of the idea
Js7-OWd19PE7,,, that you're putting forth and you are
Js7-OWd19PE7,,, trying to influence whoever is listening
Js7-OWd19PE7,,, to you to buy into that idea right so
Js7-OWd19PE7,,, it's a job that really requires a lot of
Js7-OWd19PE8,2,2.12, skill and I mentioned the
Js7-OWd19PE8,,, improvisational leadership piece because
Js7-OWd19PE8,,, actually the very first dimension of
Js7-OWd19PE8,,, improvisational leadership has to do
Js7-OWd19PE8,,, with having a strong understanding that
Js7-OWd19PE8,,, really all that exists in any given
Js7-OWd19PE9,2.15,2.3, interaction is you the other person or
Js7-OWd19PE9,,, people and the
Js7-OWd19PE9,,, moment that you share together the
Js7-OWd19PE9,,, moment right now we're in a moment yes
Js7-OWd19PE9,,, you came from something a moment ago so
Js7-OWd19PE9,,, did I we rushed over here after talking
Js7-OWd19PE10,2.32,2.45, to the folks from that video challenge
Js7-OWd19PE10,,, competition and now we're here and
Js7-OWd19PE10,,, everyone in this room has another moment
Js7-OWd19PE10,,, to get to after this for this brief time
Js7-OWd19PE10,,, our time together needs to be focused on
Js7-OWd19PE10,,, making this moment rich for each of us a
Js7-OWd19PE11,2.48,3.01, collaboration when you're making a
Js7-OWd19PE11,,, business pitch one of the essential
Js7-OWd19PE11,,, aspects of the business pitch and
Js7-OWd19PE11,,, presentation is that we have a healthy
Js7-OWd19PE11,,, respect for the moment that we're
Js7-OWd19PE11,,, sharing with that person what does that
Js7-OWd19PE12,3.02,3.15, mean it means that we remove as many
Js7-OWd19PE12,,, distractions as possible so if you're
Js7-OWd19PE12,,, making a video pitch what we see
Js7-OWd19PE12,,, graphically that's in the presentation
Js7-OWd19PE12,,, especially at the very beginning has to
Js7-OWd19PE12,,, be in concert in harmony with what
Js7-OWd19PE13,3.19,3.32, you're saying the person who is there on
Js7-OWd19PE13,,, camera has to be communicating something
Js7-OWd19PE13,,, that connects to the audience and builds
Js7-OWd19PE13,,, a relationship and if you're in person
Js7-OWd19PE13,,, the very same thing has to happen the
Js7-OWd19PE13,,, job of the presenter is to make a
Js7-OWd19PE14,3.34,3.49, connection to make a relationship to the
Js7-OWd19PE14,,, people who are there now in any business
Js7-OWd19PE14,,, pitch or presentation the first
Js7-OWd19PE14,,, important reality speaking of the moment
Js7-OWd19PE14,,, is this it's the hook it's that which
Js7-OWd19PE14,,, will draw in the audience and I'm sure
Js7-OWd19PE15,3.51,4.05, you all know this how many people have
Js7-OWd19PE15,,, heard about the hook before of course to
Js7-OWd19PE15,,, hook somebody and means it's a simple
Js7-OWd19PE15,,, word that basically means this I care
Js7-OWd19PE15,,, enough about you and I have respect for
Js7-OWd19PE15,,, you in terms of your time and all that
Js7-OWd19PE16,4.08,4.23, you have going on that I will make sure
Js7-OWd19PE16,,, that I get right to the heart of what I
Js7-OWd19PE16,,, want you to know about what I think
Js7-OWd19PE16,,, might help you and hooking somebody and
Js7-OWd19PE16,,, means getting their attention it's means
Js7-OWd19PE16,,, snapping them into awareness we need the
Js7-OWd19PE17,4.26,4.38, hook now more than we needed it even 30
Js7-OWd19PE17,,, years ago in advertising 50 years ago
Js7-OWd19PE17,,, you know mad men period anybody know
Js7-OWd19PE17,,, Mad Men TV show that's in the United
Js7-OWd19PE17,,, States it'll it'll definitely i'm sure
Js7-OWd19PE17,,, reach here at some point it's all about
Js7-OWd19PE18,4.4,4.57, advertising in the 1960s and the hook
Js7-OWd19PE18,,, was important than to the difference now
Js7-OWd19PE18,,, is that our attention span today in 2015
Js7-OWd19PE18,,, is different literally the neuro
Js7-OWd19PE18,,, transmitters of the brain the synapses
Js7-OWd19PE18,,, our brains have changed the connection
Js7-OWd19PE19,5,5.18, between our brains the visual abilities
Js7-OWd19PE19,,, and our ability to process data has
Js7-OWd19PE19,,, changed we have a faster ability to
Js7-OWd19PE19,,, synthesize imagery because in video and
Js7-OWd19PE19,,, film edits and frames have changed have
Js7-OWd19PE19,,, you watched a movie made in the 1940s
Js7-OWd19PE20,5.2,5.32, for example and you notice that
Js7-OWd19PE20,,, sometimes it'll stay on the same scene
Js7-OWd19PE20,,, for quite a while and then it might
Js7-OWd19PE20,,, change to something else later in the
Js7-OWd19PE20,,, 1980s and so certainly the 70s there was
Js7-OWd19PE20,,, experimentation with the use of video
Js7-OWd19PE21,5.35,5.48, suddenly we have this very fast-paced
Js7-OWd19PE21,,, editing that happens which means that
Js7-OWd19PE21,,, people become accustomed to quick cuts
Js7-OWd19PE21,,, you know what i mean right so we have a
Js7-OWd19PE21,,, very very fast ability to go from one
Js7-OWd19PE21,,, thought to another to another that
Js7-OWd19PE22,5.49,6.02, almost replicates what goes on in the
Js7-OWd19PE22,,, brain so if you don't hook somebody and
Js7-OWd19PE22,,, right at the beginning your movie if
Js7-OWd19PE22,,, you're presenting a movie or your visual
Js7-OWd19PE22,,, presence because right now i'm like the
Js7-OWd19PE22,,, movie you're watching will become second
Js7-OWd19PE23,6.05,6.17, to the movie going on inside of the mind
Js7-OWd19PE23,,, of the audience because you didn't hook
Js7-OWd19PE23,,, them in so now they get hooked in by
Js7-OWd19PE23,,, their thoughts by who they have to call
Js7-OWd19PE23,,, by the fight they had with their
Js7-OWd19PE23,,, girlfriend before they left for work by
Js7-OWd19PE24,6.2,6.29, the fact that oh my god it's my
Js7-OWd19PE24,,, husband's birthday today i have to go
Js7-OWd19PE24,,, buy something and all of a sudden I'm
Js7-OWd19PE24,,, not listening to what the presenter is
Js7-OWd19PE24,,, saying so number one is grab the
Js7-OWd19PE24,,, attention of the listener how do we do
Js7-OWd19PE25,6.31,6.47, that before we even begin there's
Js7-OWd19PE25,,, something we bring on stage to help us
Js7-OWd19PE25,,, deal with the noise right the noise
Js7-OWd19PE25,,, there's always noise there's always
Js7-OWd19PE25,,, somebody doing something that
Js7-OWd19PE25,,, could be a distraction right now it's a
Js7-OWd19PE26,6.49,7.02, hammer you can hear a hammer the other
Js7-OWd19PE26,,, day yesterday when I was teaching a temp
Js7-OWd19PE26,,, jam in the middle of the workshop
Js7-OWd19PE26,,, somebody decided to wash the windows and
Js7-OWd19PE26,,, I mean really in a very devoted and
Js7-OWd19PE26,,, passionate way he was washing the
Js7-OWd19PE27,7.03,7.14, windows the windows were shaking and we
Js7-OWd19PE27,,, could feel the earth moving at first I
Js7-OWd19PE27,,, thought it's not an earthquake is it and
Js7-OWd19PE27,,, then I realized no there's a guy washing
Js7-OWd19PE27,,, the windows so there's always something
Js7-OWd19PE27,,, that we have to be in a way dealing with
Js7-OWd19PE28,7.16,7.3, what we bring on stage to hook people
Js7-OWd19PE28,,, before we open our mouths and say
Js7-OWd19PE28,,, anything is our body and our mind and
Js7-OWd19PE28,,, our intention one of the first things I
Js7-OWd19PE28,,, want to convey to you before I talk
Js7-OWd19PE28,,, about the presence which is the other
Js7-OWd19PE29,7.32,7.47, word that I would use the presence that
Js7-OWd19PE29,,, we have that has to find a way to
Js7-OWd19PE29,,, connect with the audience is this words
Js7-OWd19PE29,,, are important what's more important than
Js7-OWd19PE29,,, the words because people don't really
Js7-OWd19PE29,,, hear the words as much as they hear the
Js7-OWd19PE30,7.5,8.04, intention behind the words if you can go
Js7-OWd19PE30,,, home with that idea it would be maybe
Js7-OWd19PE30,,, the key to something very powerful in
Js7-OWd19PE30,,, making your pitches it's the intention
Js7-OWd19PE30,,, behind the word that is conveyed that
Js7-OWd19PE30,,, matters it's not all the data and you
Js7-OWd19PE31,8.07,8.2, telling me how great the data is that
Js7-OWd19PE31,,, really matters it's your intention it's
Js7-OWd19PE31,,, the emotion it's what I feel about the
Js7-OWd19PE31,,, idea it's what I feel about you and why
Js7-OWd19PE31,,, I think my idea might help you and what
Js7-OWd19PE31,,, my intention is which is hopefully to
Js7-OWd19PE32,8.22,8.35, help you to motivate you to influence
Js7-OWd19PE32,,, you to see that maybe your life might
Js7-OWd19PE32,,, need this improvement that I might be
Js7-OWd19PE32,,, talking about while I'm talking to you
Js7-OWd19PE32,,, right now there's an intention that I
Js7-OWd19PE32,,, feel as I'm speaking to you I'm saying
Js7-OWd19PE33,8.37,8.51, words and maybe you're picking up my
Js7-OWd19PE33,,, intention what intention are you picking
Js7-OWd19PE33,,, up as I speak to you right now about
Js7-OWd19PE33,,, this subject so far quick just somebody
Js7-OWd19PE33,,, call it out or raise a hand yes I want
Js7-OWd19PE33,,, to help this is true this is what I feel
Js7-OWd19PE34,8.52,9.03, so you're matching something that I feel
Js7-OWd19PE34,,, that I've been a little successful that
Js7-OWd19PE34,,, maybe you were feeling that any other
Js7-OWd19PE34,,, intention that you're feeling
Js7-OWd19PE34,,, me right now about what I feel about
Js7-OWd19PE34,,, this topic I want to hook you into yes
Js7-OWd19PE35,9.08,9.24, I'm talking about hooking and I'm doing
Js7-OWd19PE35,,, that while i'm talking yes exactly what
Js7-OWd19PE35,,, else what emotion do you feel I'm
Js7-OWd19PE35,,, conveying right now to be a model yes
Js7-OWd19PE35,,, thank you someone else I love the topic
Js7-OWd19PE35,,, yes and in fact can you feel that I love
Js7-OWd19PE36,9.27,9.43, this topic because I care about the
Js7-OWd19PE36,,, stories that get conveyed about business
Js7-OWd19PE36,,, I teach at MIT Sloan I am around many
Js7-OWd19PE36,,, people at MIT who have brilliant ideas
Js7-OWd19PE36,,, I'm in the business school so of course
Js7-OWd19PE36,,, there are many people doing startups and
Js7-OWd19PE37,9.45,9.56, the story of these startups is very
Js7-OWd19PE37,,, important to me because of my background
Js7-OWd19PE37,,, also in theatre there's another reason I
Js7-OWd19PE37,,, care about story because story is the
Js7-OWd19PE37,,, stuff that makes the human being the
Js7-OWd19PE37,,, human community move forward and learn
Js7-OWd19PE38,9.58,10.12, about itself it brings comfort religion
Js7-OWd19PE38,,, is a story it's the story that comforts
Js7-OWd19PE38,,, people science has a story it's a story
Js7-OWd19PE38,,, that makes us understand the universe so
Js7-OWd19PE38,,, when I say to you that the intention is
Js7-OWd19PE38,,, important I cannot say that strongly
Js7-OWd19PE39,10.14,10.27, enough because the words are great it's
Js7-OWd19PE39,,, nice to have the data it's important
Js7-OWd19PE39,,, it's essential we need to have a
Js7-OWd19PE39,,, concrete very very specific technical
Js7-OWd19PE39,,, backup to whatever we say I don't in any
Js7-OWd19PE39,,, way contradict that and all of the
Js7-OWd19PE40,10.3,10.43, technical knowledge will be lost if the
Js7-OWd19PE40,,, intention behind the words is not human
Js7-OWd19PE40,,, and making relationship and it has to
Js7-OWd19PE40,,, dare to look into the eyes of the person
Js7-OWd19PE40,,, you're talking to even if you're on a
Js7-OWd19PE40,,, video you have to look right through the
Js7-OWd19PE41,10.45,11, camera into the person who you visualize
Js7-OWd19PE41,,, you're talking to and speak to the heart
Js7-OWd19PE41,,, of that person as if you imagine that
Js7-OWd19PE41,,, that person is your friend a trusted
Js7-OWd19PE41,,, friend someone you're not threatened by
Js7-OWd19PE41,,, so there's the first issue most people
Js7-OWd19PE42,11.04,11.15, when they create a business pitch the
Js7-OWd19PE42,,, first instinct for a beginner and it's
Js7-OWd19PE42,,, very natural there's no fault to this
Js7-OWd19PE42,,, there's no judgment about this
Js7-OWd19PE42,,, most of us will think you know I really
Js7-OWd19PE42,,, need to convince the person right have
Js7-OWd19PE43,11.18,11.31, you felt I need to tell you why my idea
Js7-OWd19PE43,,, is good I need to really give you I have
Js7-OWd19PE43,,, to prove it to you I have to prove to
Js7-OWd19PE43,,, you that my idea is good what that does
Js7-OWd19PE43,,, if you consider it and by the way it's
Js7-OWd19PE43,,, understandable that you'd want to do
Js7-OWd19PE44,11.32,11.43, that because you want to get the money
Js7-OWd19PE44,,, you want the venture capitalists you
Js7-OWd19PE44,,, want the investors you want to get
Js7-OWd19PE44,,, people on board of course right the
Js7-OWd19PE44,,, problem that sets up strictly from the
Js7-OWd19PE44,,, point of view of telling the story and
Js7-OWd19PE45,11.46,12.02, having what I said is that moment of
Js7-OWd19PE45,,, relationship with your audience is this
Js7-OWd19PE45,,, if I am trying to prove to you and
Js7-OWd19PE45,,, convince you of my idea I am setting up
Js7-OWd19PE45,,, a conflict before I even open up my
Js7-OWd19PE45,,, mouth because the conflict becomes I'm
Js7-OWd19PE46,12.04,12.17, assuming that you don't like my idea or
Js7-OWd19PE46,,, that maybe my idea isn't good enough
Js7-OWd19PE46,,, until I have to prove it so now I've
Js7-OWd19PE46,,, already put myself in a lower position
Js7-OWd19PE46,,, and it makes me appear less confident if
Js7-OWd19PE46,,, my intention is to convince because do
Js7-OWd19PE47,12.21,12.31, we could try to convince people who
Js7-OWd19PE47,,, already want to listen to us no do you
Js7-OWd19PE47,,, like to listen to somebody who is
Js7-OWd19PE47,,, standing there trying to tell you why
Js7-OWd19PE47,,, you should really want to listen to them
Js7-OWd19PE47,,, how do you feel when somebody does that
Js7-OWd19PE48,12.33,12.45, you tell me when somebody is strongly
Js7-OWd19PE48,,, convincing you I'm trying to tell you
Js7-OWd19PE48,,, why you should listen to what they're
Js7-OWd19PE48,,, saying how do you feel you tell me
Js7-OWd19PE48,,, attacked that's a strong word and that's
Js7-OWd19PE48,,, exactly I think and that's why we call
Js7-OWd19PE49,12.47,13, it by the way hard sell because hard
Js7-OWd19PE49,,, sell is hard and it can feel like an
Js7-OWd19PE49,,, attack what else do you feel when
Js7-OWd19PE49,,, somebody is telling you what they want
Js7-OWd19PE49,,, you to think pressure exactly now you're
Js7-OWd19PE49,,, creating the conflict of pressure so the
Js7-OWd19PE50,13.04,13.18, challenge and the art and why we're all
Js7-OWd19PE50,,, sitting here standing here and sitting
Js7-OWd19PE50,,, here today is this the very natural
Js7-OWd19PE50,,, instinct that we would all have which is
Js7-OWd19PE50,,, normal which is to say I want to make a
Js7-OWd19PE50,,, business pitch so I want to convince you
Js7-OWd19PE51,13.2,13.34, is the very thing that can most work
Js7-OWd19PE51,,, against the business pinch pitch
Js7-OWd19PE51,,, if you most work against it so wow what
Js7-OWd19PE51,,, do we do about that that's our natural
Js7-OWd19PE51,,, instinct we have to find a way to
Js7-OWd19PE51,,, transform this desire of convincing into
Js7-OWd19PE52,13.38,13.53, an act of dialogue because when I'm in a
Js7-OWd19PE52,,, dialogue with you and when I'm in a
Js7-OWd19PE52,,, conversation I'm not thinking about
Js7-OWd19PE52,,, convincing if you're my friend if you're
Js7-OWd19PE52,,, somebody who I believe is interested I'm
Js7-OWd19PE52,,, more interested now in things like
Js7-OWd19PE53,13.54,14.08, listening to you sharing something with
Js7-OWd19PE53,,, you offering something which by the way
Js7-OWd19PE53,,, an improvisational leadership if you
Js7-OWd19PE53,,, took one of those seminars you'd hear me
Js7-OWd19PE53,,, say that at the heart of the
Js7-OWd19PE53,,, improvisation and improvisational
Js7-OWd19PE54,14.1,14.23, leadership skill base is something
Js7-OWd19PE54,,, called making an offer where you're
Js7-OWd19PE54,,, actually having what we call a yes and
Js7-OWd19PE54,,, mentality where you make an idea
Js7-OWd19PE54,,, offering and whatever the audience says
Js7-OWd19PE54,,, back to you you build on it and that's
Js7-OWd19PE55,14.25,14.4, collaboration these are the things that
Js7-OWd19PE55,,, start to happen when we shift from
Js7-OWd19PE55,,, convincing to dialogue can you follow
Js7-OWd19PE55,,, that and does that connect does that
Js7-OWd19PE55,,, make a connection for you yes so I
Js7-OWd19PE55,,, mentioned that when we come up on stage
Js7-OWd19PE56,14.42,14.54, we have something already with us that
Js7-OWd19PE56,,, we carry with us every day which is our
Js7-OWd19PE56,,, physical presence and I want to take
Js7-OWd19PE56,,, that last word presence because it's so
Js7-OWd19PE56,,, important there are five dimensions of
Js7-OWd19PE56,,, presence that we need in a presentation
Js7-OWd19PE57,14.58,15.11, or a pitch basically a pitch is a
Js7-OWd19PE57,,, presentation of an idea right it's
Js7-OWd19PE57,,, trying to hook someone in one is that
Js7-OWd19PE57,,, you if you're making this presentation
Js7-OWd19PE57,,, have to be accessible can somebody
Js7-OWd19PE57,,, translate accessible for me in Spanish
Js7-OWd19PE58,15.14,15.27, meaning you're somebody that somebody
Js7-OWd19PE58,,, can approach yes you're you're somebody
Js7-OWd19PE58,,, like I can walk towards you and I feel
Js7-OWd19PE58,,, like you're accessible you're somebody i
Js7-OWd19PE58,,, can go toward and there's not a wall or
Js7-OWd19PE58,,, a door or I don't have to call for
Js7-OWd19PE59,15.28,15.41, people in order to get connected to you
Js7-OWd19PE59,,, right so accessibility is very important
Js7-OWd19PE59,,, number two is engagement to have
Js7-OWd19PE59,,, presence
Js7-OWd19PE59,,, the audience needs to feel they can
Js7-OWd19PE59,,, engage with you and also that you are
Js7-OWd19PE60,15.43,15.56, engaging with them and not talking to
Js7-OWd19PE60,,, yourself or talking to the ideas what
Js7-OWd19PE60,,, often happens is that people become so
Js7-OWd19PE60,,, consumed in the idea and believe me I've
Js7-OWd19PE60,,, been there where you're thinking of a
Js7-OWd19PE60,,, new model you're thinking of a new
Js7-OWd19PE61,15.57,16.09, project your startup idea you've been
Js7-OWd19PE61,,, working on it all hours of the night
Js7-OWd19PE61,,, your family never sees you right you're
Js7-OWd19PE61,,, so working so much involved and suddenly
Js7-OWd19PE61,,, it's almost as if we forget to talk how
Js7-OWd19PE61,,, to talk to people we're only talking to
Js7-OWd19PE62,16.12,16.22, the project we're talking to the ideas
Js7-OWd19PE62,,, we're talking in such a very technical
Js7-OWd19PE62,,, way that we're not anymore with the
Js7-OWd19PE62,,, people we need to engage the human being
Js7-OWd19PE62,,, that's in a moment right in front of us
Js7-OWd19PE62,,, the third dimension after accessibility
Js7-OWd19PE63,16.25,16.42, and engagement is making sure that we
Js7-OWd19PE63,,, have what is perhaps the most essential
Js7-OWd19PE63,,, attribute or quality that is needed now
Js7-OWd19PE63,,, in business and I'm hearing this in
Js7-OWd19PE63,,, business schools everywhere empathy
Js7-OWd19PE63,,, empathy you might think wow business
Js7-OWd19PE64,16.46,17.02, empathy huh what business empathy yeah
Js7-OWd19PE64,,, the world has changed the world is
Js7-OWd19PE64,,, changing the hierarchical top-down the
Js7-OWd19PE64,,, boss says hey this is the plan now go do
Js7-OWd19PE64,,, it and everybody goes in runs and does
Js7-OWd19PE64,,, it this hierarchy we still see these
Js7-OWd19PE65,17.04,17.15, hierarchies and our companies I know
Js7-OWd19PE65,,, they're still here they're in the states
Js7-OWd19PE65,,, that hierarchy is changing sometimes
Js7-OWd19PE65,,, it's closed sometimes it's open it's
Js7-OWd19PE65,,, flat and sometimes you're wondering
Js7-OWd19PE65,,, where is the boss either way what is
Js7-OWd19PE66,17.19,17.33, needed is empathy because when you have
Js7-OWd19PE66,,, greater accessibility to the people and
Js7-OWd19PE66,,, you're having less of this hierarchical
Js7-OWd19PE66,,, ordering there's a need for more empathy
Js7-OWd19PE66,,, so when you're making your pitch you
Js7-OWd19PE66,,, have to find a way to talk to the human
Js7-OWd19PE67,17.35,17.51, heart of the person who you are trying
Js7-OWd19PE67,,, to influence it's not enough to talk to
Js7-OWd19PE67,,, their mind it's not enough to talk to
Js7-OWd19PE67,,, their knowledge it's very important to
Js7-OWd19PE67,,, let your knowledge go through your heart
Js7-OWd19PE67,,, and speak to their heart
Js7-OWd19PE68,17.53,18.03, don't leave the knowledge behind make
Js7-OWd19PE68,,, sure we include the heart when we're
Js7-OWd19PE68,,, speaking and the empathy and make sure
Js7-OWd19PE68,,, you imagine how that person might be
Js7-OWd19PE68,,, feeling and what it would be like to
Js7-OWd19PE68,,, feel from that person's perspective
Js7-OWd19PE69,18.05,18.17, about your idea that's incredibly
Js7-OWd19PE69,,, important one of the techniques I coach
Js7-OWd19PE69,,, for people to do when you're getting
Js7-OWd19PE69,,, ready to do the pitch the presentation
Js7-OWd19PE69,,, whether it's live or not is get a friend
Js7-OWd19PE69,,, to play the person that you're pitching
Js7-OWd19PE70,18.2,18.33, to and let them ask questions don't have
Js7-OWd19PE70,,, them play a skeptical person let them
Js7-OWd19PE70,,, play themselves and what they would want
Js7-OWd19PE70,,, to ask you what they care about and you
Js7-OWd19PE70,,, have to then dialogue with them and use
Js7-OWd19PE70,,, some of what you say in that little role
Js7-OWd19PE71,18.35,18.54, play in your pitch the other very very
Js7-OWd19PE71,,, important essence of presence has to do
Js7-OWd19PE71,,, with being able to be expressive and
Js7-OWd19PE71,,, when I say expressive I don't mean you
Js7-OWd19PE71,,, have to perform or you have to put on a
Js7-OWd19PE71,,, show when I say expressiveness what do
Js7-OWd19PE72,18.58,19.16, you think of what do you think I mean by
Js7-OWd19PE72,,, expressiveness say it again bully talk
Js7-OWd19PE72,,, bodytalk body language expressive
Js7-OWd19PE72,,, exactly allowing your body to be what we
Js7-OWd19PE72,,, say in harmony with your words so that's
Js7-OWd19PE72,,, part of one's expressiveness so that I'm
Js7-OWd19PE73,19.19,19.29, not standing here like now you know
Js7-OWd19PE73,,, talking to you like this right my body
Js7-OWd19PE73,,, is not right now we say congruent I just
Js7-OWd19PE73,,, learned that there's a similar word in
Js7-OWd19PE73,,, Spanish congruent my body isn't coming I
Js7-OWd19PE73,,, really care about this subject right but
Js7-OWd19PE74,19.31,19.44, I don't look right my body is completely
Js7-OWd19PE74,,, contradicting so to really let yourself
Js7-OWd19PE74,,, get engaged with what you're saying
Js7-OWd19PE74,,, what's another association you have to
Js7-OWd19PE74,,, expressiveness what does it mean to be
Js7-OWd19PE74,,, expressive it means yes go yes yes which
Js7-OWd19PE75,19.51,20.03, that emphasis he said the way you
Js7-OWd19PE75,,, emphasize words you don't emphasize the
Js7-OWd19PE75,,, words because you're thinking I should
Js7-OWd19PE75,,, emphasize usually we emphasize words for
Js7-OWd19PE75,,, the same reason in music when the
Js7-OWd19PE75,,, dynamics change and it gets louder or
Js7-OWd19PE76,20.05,20.19, softer or there's an emphasis that
Js7-OWd19PE76,,, happens because of the way the notes are
Js7-OWd19PE76,,, arranged it's because the the composer
Js7-OWd19PE76,,, felt something and wanted to convey that
Js7-OWd19PE76,,, feeling and once that feeling to come
Js7-OWd19PE76,,, through the particular tempo and rhythm
Js7-OWd19PE77,20.2,20.36, and choice of notes and that is the
Js7-OWd19PE77,,, expression expressiveness expressiveness
Js7-OWd19PE77,,, means emotion the emotion that's being
Js7-OWd19PE77,,, conveyed and that something from the
Js7-OWd19PE77,,, inside is being delivered to the outside
Js7-OWd19PE77,,, expressed instead of being internalized
Js7-OWd19PE78,20.42,20.52, finally what we need is a vision and of
Js7-OWd19PE78,,, course you with your startup's you have
Js7-OWd19PE78,,, that vision you have the store you have
Js7-OWd19PE78,,, the idea sometimes I'm giving
Js7-OWd19PE78,,, presentation coaching and people don't
Js7-OWd19PE78,,, even know the vision yet of what they
Js7-OWd19PE79,20.54,21.05, want to be talking about give me an
Js7-OWd19PE79,,, example please of some of the the
Js7-OWd19PE79,,, startup projects and ideas that you're
Js7-OWd19PE79,,, working on please so I know who's in the
Js7-OWd19PE79,,, room I'd love to hear just call it out
Js7-OWd19PE79,,, just give me your hand and then tell me
Js7-OWd19PE80,21.07,21.26, some of the ideas and projects you're
Js7-OWd19PE80,,, working on few people anybody have one
Js7-OWd19PE80,,, you want to offer yes delivering
Js7-OWd19PE80,,, groceries in two hours fantastic
Js7-OWd19PE80,,, something else and it doesn't have to be
Js7-OWd19PE80,,, that your idea is already fully formed
Js7-OWd19PE81,21.28,21.5, it can be this is still in an idea stage
Js7-OWd19PE81,,, somebody else yes
Js7-OWd19PE81,,, a prosthetic device that can help people
Js7-OWd19PE81,,, who've had imputations do the
Js7-OWd19PE81,,, rehabilitation process that is so
Js7-OWd19PE81,,, important we're dealing with that a lot
Js7-OWd19PE82,21.51,22.02, now in the states with many many
Js7-OWd19PE82,,, soldiers who've come back this is very
Js7-OWd19PE82,,, important it's a big deal it's a very
Js7-OWd19PE82,,, big thing and I come from Boston where
Js7-OWd19PE82,,, we had the Marathon bombing and we have
Js7-OWd19PE82,,, many many people who lost arms and legs
Js7-OWd19PE83,22.04,22.17, and some people who lost both legs so
Js7-OWd19PE83,,, this is a huge topic I connect with that
Js7-OWd19PE83,,, very much so when we have these ideas
Js7-OWd19PE83,,, that we have to put forth obviously this
Js7-OWd19PE83,,, already tells the story the delivering
Js7-OWd19PE83,,, of grocery within two hours groceries we
Js7-OWd19PE84,22.2,22.31, need that right we don't have time this
Js7-OWd19PE84,,, is not just a nice idea this could be
Js7-OWd19PE84,,, essential for somebody's quality of life
Js7-OWd19PE84,,, and what kind of family into environment
Js7-OWd19PE84,,, they can live in so there's a story
Js7-OWd19PE84,,, behind that idea it's practical it also
Js7-OWd19PE85,22.34,22.45, speaks to a human need right so that's
Js7-OWd19PE85,,, the kind of story you want to bring
Js7-OWd19PE85,,, forth but the rehabilitation process or
Js7-OWd19PE85,,, what happens when the person is looking
Js7-OWd19PE85,,, to have their grocery delivered is
Js7-OWd19PE85,,, something that will affect their
Js7-OWd19PE86,22.48,23.04, personal story and ultimately their
Js7-OWd19PE86,,, happiness and their well-being and their
Js7-OWd19PE86,,, enjoyment of life because ultimately all
Js7-OWd19PE86,,, of this stuff we're doing in business is
Js7-OWd19PE86,,, to make life a little easier let's face
Js7-OWd19PE86,,, it it's not easy to live on planet Earth
Js7-OWd19PE87,23.07,23.19, sometimes right it's a little bit
Js7-OWd19PE87,,, challenging so in order to make life a
Js7-OWd19PE87,,, little easier and to deal with the
Js7-OWd19PE87,,, conflicts of life business create
Js7-OWd19PE87,,, solutions when it's inspired through the
Js7-OWd19PE87,,, innovations that are represented by the
Js7-OWd19PE88,23.22,23.34, minds of the people sitting in this room
Js7-OWd19PE88,,, now there is something else I want to
Js7-OWd19PE88,,, mention about a business pitches and
Js7-OWd19PE88,,, presentations and it's this it's very
Js7-OWd19PE88,,, important to be able to know how to read
Js7-OWd19PE88,,, the moment and read the room which means
Js7-OWd19PE89,23.38,23.49, sensing your audience sensing what they
Js7-OWd19PE89,,, are thinking sensing what they're
Js7-OWd19PE89,,, feeling what they might wish that you
Js7-OWd19PE89,,, would be talking about what their
Js7-OWd19PE89,,, thoughts and reactions are being able to
Js7-OWd19PE89,,, read somebody's body language or even if
Js7-OWd19PE90,23.51,24.03, there's a tension in the room or there's
Js7-OWd19PE90,,, a calmness in the room the presenter
Js7-OWd19PE90,,, needs to be able to sense that and if
Js7-OWd19PE90,,, you're making a video presentation and
Js7-OWd19PE90,,, your pitch is in a film and voiceover
Js7-OWd19PE90,,, format we have to be sensing even in
Js7-OWd19PE91,24.06,24.18, that format what read the audience who
Js7-OWd19PE91,,, are these people and what might they be
Js7-OWd19PE91,,, interested in that's part of it
Js7-OWd19PE91,,, obviously how many of you here have made
Js7-OWd19PE91,,, a business pitch already I just like to
Js7-OWd19PE91,,, see a show of hands you've already
Js7-OWd19PE92,24.19,24.32, created a business how many of you
Js7-OWd19PE92,,, have ever given a presentation on a
Js7-OWd19PE92,,, particular idea or subject or topic that
Js7-OWd19PE92,,, you care about terrific how many of you
Js7-OWd19PE92,,, are here for a different reason you
Js7-OWd19PE92,,, haven't done either of those two things
Js7-OWd19PE93,24.34,24.48, anybody what's the reason that you're
Js7-OWd19PE93,,, here learning fantastic number one thing
Js7-OWd19PE93,,, about any activity don't forget the
Js7-OWd19PE93,,, learning and don't forget the fun right
Js7-OWd19PE93,,, we have to make sure business can be
Js7-OWd19PE93,,, very serious stuff there's also an
Js7-OWd19PE94,24.51,25, element of fun that has to be conveyed
Js7-OWd19PE94,,, in the presentation and I mean that in
Js7-OWd19PE94,,, all seriousness if we're not having fun
Js7-OWd19PE94,,, with these pitches and with these ideas
Js7-OWd19PE94,,, then there's something missing and it
Js7-OWd19PE94,,, won't be conveyed connecting with your
Js7-OWd19PE95,25.04,25.21, audience is incredibly important and let
Js7-OWd19PE95,,, me fill this idea out a little bit when
Js7-OWd19PE95,,, I speak to you if I'm not making a
Js7-OWd19PE95,,, connection and I'm not engaging your
Js7-OWd19PE95,,, story then my story will be lost what
Js7-OWd19PE95,,, I'm trying to say because people want to
Js7-OWd19PE96,25.24,25.38, feel validated for what they already
Js7-OWd19PE96,,, feel and they want to feel engaged so
Js7-OWd19PE96,,, it's very very very important that we
Js7-OWd19PE96,,, engage people's stories and that we use
Js7-OWd19PE96,,, story but we tell a story through our
Js7-OWd19PE96,,, presentation so that when the listener
Js7-OWd19PE97,25.41,25.54, is interacting with it they feel like
Js7-OWd19PE97,,, they've been brought into a story that
Js7-OWd19PE97,,, we have invited them into and the story
Js7-OWd19PE97,,, is part of what the hook is about right
Js7-OWd19PE97,,, the ability to tell the story and make
Js7-OWd19PE97,,, people feel like they're part of the
Js7-OWd19PE98,25.55,26.08, story instead of making them feel like
Js7-OWd19PE98,,, they're targets targets where we see
Js7-OWd19PE98,,, them as having something we want and
Js7-OWd19PE98,,, want to get something from you that's
Js7-OWd19PE98,,, not telling a story your ATAR you have
Js7-OWd19PE98,,, money I need your money so let me tell
Js7-OWd19PE99,26.1,26.23, you what I need from you and give it to
Js7-OWd19PE99,,, me no it's a story there has to be a
Js7-OWd19PE99,,, collaboration I know guys I know a lot
Js7-OWd19PE99,,, of people men and women who are their
Js7-OWd19PE99,,, passion in life quite frankly is to give
Js7-OWd19PE99,,, money to promising ideas they've
Js7-OWd19PE100,26.26,26.39, succeeded in their in their businesses
Js7-OWd19PE100,,, and their industries and now what they
Js7-OWd19PE100,,, want to do is help grow other ideas and
Js7-OWd19PE100,,, when I talk to them these are people who
Js7-OWd19PE100,,, have accomplished something already they
Js7-OWd19PE100,,, are very confident in what their
Js7-OWd19PE101,26.41,26.52, abilities are and sometimes they feel
Js7-OWd19PE101,,, like there was something more they
Js7-OWd19PE101,,, needed to do with their life there might
Js7-OWd19PE101,,, be a passion they had that they didn't
Js7-OWd19PE101,,, fulfill their might be that they were
Js7-OWd19PE101,,, very interested in let's say I don't
Js7-OWd19PE102,26.56,27.07, know sports but they went off into a
Js7-OWd19PE102,,, business direction so then somebody
Js7-OWd19PE102,,, comes to them with an idea a startup
Js7-OWd19PE102,,, that has to do with something about
Js7-OWd19PE102,,, measuring the heartbeat when somebody is
Js7-OWd19PE102,,, working out or being able to be aware of
Js7-OWd19PE103,27.1,27.21, all of your medical data when you're
Js7-OWd19PE103,,, working out or something else about
Js7-OWd19PE103,,, sports a sneaker design sports shoe
Js7-OWd19PE103,,, design that really helps give ultimate
Js7-OWd19PE103,,, performance when I talk to my colleagues
Js7-OWd19PE103,,, and friends who are investors and who
Js7-OWd19PE104,27.23,27.38, look to help people and contribute they
Js7-OWd19PE104,,, tell me that what they're looking for
Js7-OWd19PE104,,, most when somebody gives a presentation
Js7-OWd19PE104,,, is they're looking to see something in
Js7-OWd19PE104,,, that person that reminds them of the
Js7-OWd19PE104,,, passion they had when they first started
Js7-OWd19PE105,27.4,27.54, their idea so they go back into their
Js7-OWd19PE105,,, own story they want to feel like they
Js7-OWd19PE105,,, can help somebody else grow an idea the
Js7-OWd19PE105,,, way they did and they want to feel like
Js7-OWd19PE105,,, they could become an important partner
Js7-OWd19PE105,,, in that person's life so the story is
Js7-OWd19PE106,27.57,28.08, incredibly important I had one friend
Js7-OWd19PE106,,, say to me oh you know I heard a
Js7-OWd19PE106,,, presentation and he just he just gave me
Js7-OWd19PE106,,, like an avalanche how do you say
Js7-OWd19PE106,,, avalanche in Spanish like when they're
Js7-OWd19PE106,,, the mountain lunched okay there you go
Js7-OWd19PE107,28.11,28.24, good an avalanche of data and statistics
Js7-OWd19PE107,,, and bottom line and he said look I'm a
Js7-OWd19PE107,,, money person so of course I want to know
Js7-OWd19PE107,,, all of that he said but I didn't need
Js7-OWd19PE107,,, seventy percent of the presentation to
Js7-OWd19PE107,,, be pouring that on my head I walked away
Js7-OWd19PE108,28.27,28.38, and I didn't even know who these people
Js7-OWd19PE108,,, are why they care what what makes them
Js7-OWd19PE108,,, get up in the morning and go do this how
Js7-OWd19PE108,,, has this impacted their family where did
Js7-OWd19PE108,,, they get the idea in the first place
Js7-OWd19PE108,,, right somebody in the challenge we were
Js7-OWd19PE109,28.41,28.54, just doing now so I got this idea
Js7-OWd19PE109,,, because a family member I had had his
Js7-OWd19PE109,,, car stolen and it made me think of this
Js7-OWd19PE109,,, technology that would be a locking
Js7-OWd19PE109,,, system in the car but right away that's
Js7-OWd19PE109,,, a personal offer that says hey something
Js7-OWd19PE110,28.56,29.09, intimate happened to me and I want to
Js7-OWd19PE110,,, help people who have that experience so
Js7-OWd19PE110,,, finding a way to poke people in through
Js7-OWd19PE110,,, the story is very very important putting
Js7-OWd19PE110,,, yourself in the other person's shoes is
Js7-OWd19PE110,,, also very important and remembering that
Js7-OWd19PE111,29.13,29.29, if you're giving a presentation that is
Js7-OWd19PE111,,, in the moment and your audience isn't
Js7-OWd19PE111,,, saying very much to you what is a very
Js7-OWd19PE111,,, natural tendency is to tell is to begin
Js7-OWd19PE111,,, to imagine i should say that you know
Js7-OWd19PE111,,, what they're thinking have you ever had
Js7-OWd19PE112,29.32,29.41, that happen where you're standing in
Js7-OWd19PE112,,, front of people and they're not saying
Js7-OWd19PE112,,, something back and so then you start to
Js7-OWd19PE112,,, make up a story about what you think
Js7-OWd19PE112,,, they're thinking anybody have that
Js7-OWd19PE112,,, happen yes and have you ever made up a
Js7-OWd19PE113,29.45,29.58, story that sounds something like oh they
Js7-OWd19PE113,,, might be bored this isn't connecting
Js7-OWd19PE113,,, anybody have that thought oh wow I'm
Js7-OWd19PE113,,, really right now what I'm saying this
Js7-OWd19PE113,,, really this this really isn't going well
Js7-OWd19PE113,,, that they really think this this is no
Js7-OWd19PE114,30,30.17, good that is what we call the inner
Js7-OWd19PE114,,, story remember that everybody has an
Js7-OWd19PE114,,, inner story and an outer story and the
Js7-OWd19PE114,,, inner story is made up of our thoughts
Js7-OWd19PE114,,, feelings and ideas some of which are
Js7-OWd19PE114,,, coming from raw primitive emotion and
Js7-OWd19PE115,30.21,30.33, what we call it in acting is the inner
Js7-OWd19PE115,,, critic does anyone here know what the
Js7-OWd19PE115,,, inner critic is you hear that expression
Js7-OWd19PE115,,, before
Js7-OWd19PE115,,, you're saying yes how do you define the
Js7-OWd19PE115,,, inner critic I know you know what it is
Js7-OWd19PE116,30.39,31.17, yes yes yes in one sentence I'm going to
Js7-OWd19PE116,,, say it in Spanish okay ya es auto
Js7-OWd19PE116,,, kritika o se cuando estÃ¡ en frente a la
Js7-OWd19PE116,,, you DNC a'ight empiezas a question our
Js7-OWd19PE116,,, todo lo que tu haces if if someone could
Js7-OWd19PE116,,, help me to translate that in English
Js7-OWd19PE117,31.19,31.41, that would be good for you see translate
Js7-OWd19PE117,,, a quick that sentence yes yes and the
Js7-OWd19PE117,,, inner critic even goes a step beyond
Js7-OWd19PE117,,, that it's that self-questioning
Js7-OWd19PE117,,, self-doubting and you know it's the
Js7-OWd19PE117,,, inner critic when it starts to tell you
Js7-OWd19PE118,31.43,31.54, you're no good you're you're making a
Js7-OWd19PE118,,, mess of things it's terrible what you
Js7-OWd19PE118,,, said people don't like you how dare you
Js7-OWd19PE118,,, get up there you don't know what you're
Js7-OWd19PE118,,, doing you shouldn't really be doing this
Js7-OWd19PE118,,, because you don't really have any skill
Js7-OWd19PE119,31.56,32.07, at this they think you're a fool they
Js7-OWd19PE119,,, look stupid you look stupid you look too
Js7-OWd19PE119,,, fat you look too thin you look too smart
Js7-OWd19PE119,,, you don't look smart enough it's all
Js7-OWd19PE119,,, those toxic messages that go in the
Js7-OWd19PE119,,, brain and that sit there and activate us
Js7-OWd19PE120,32.1,32.23, some of us have an inner critic that
Js7-OWd19PE120,,, shows up before others during others
Js7-OWd19PE120,,, after a big event why am i bringing this
Js7-OWd19PE120,,, up I'm bringing this up because if we
Js7-OWd19PE120,,, don't have a strong relationship to
Js7-OWd19PE120,,, knowing how to manage our inner critic
Js7-OWd19PE121,32.25,32.39, that internal story is going to bleed
Js7-OWd19PE121,,, into the outer story that we're trying
Js7-OWd19PE121,,, to say the inner critic will say don't
Js7-OWd19PE121,,, say anything so we'll be quiet or it'll
Js7-OWd19PE121,,, make a second guess every word we say
Js7-OWd19PE121,,, and then
Js7-OWd19PE122,32.4,32.54, we will be very kind of awkward in our
Js7-OWd19PE122,,, speech because we're hearing something
Js7-OWd19PE122,,, say yeah that word no not that word yep
Js7-OWd19PE122,,, not that word can you imagine by the
Js7-OWd19PE122,,, time you go to speak right why is this
Js7-OWd19PE122,,, essential you tell me why is it
Js7-OWd19PE123,32.56,33.11, essential why am i coming here to say to
Js7-OWd19PE123,,, you in order to create a vibrant
Js7-OWd19PE123,,, influential persuasive business pitch
Js7-OWd19PE123,,, and presentation we need to be able to
Js7-OWd19PE123,,, manage our inner critic why am I saying
Js7-OWd19PE123,,, that make the connection you tell me why
Js7-OWd19PE124,33.15,33.37, is this important yes yes I think you
Js7-OWd19PE124,,, were going to say something yes you know
Js7-OWd19PE124,,, you you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what do
Js7-OWd19PE124,,, you what do you think is important about
Js7-OWd19PE124,,, that exactly see I love that you just
Js7-OWd19PE124,,, went right to the heart because it's
Js7-OWd19PE125,33.41,33.56, very practical if we're not paying
Js7-OWd19PE125,,, attention to the inner critic who are we
Js7-OWd19PE125,,, paying attention to the audience if I'm
Js7-OWd19PE125,,, all caught up in worrying about how do I
Js7-OWd19PE125,,, look how do I sound did I sound smart do
Js7-OWd19PE125,,, I sound like I have enough intelligence
Js7-OWd19PE126,33.57,34.08, do they like me do they like me do they
Js7-OWd19PE126,,, like me which is maybe on a baby level
Js7-OWd19PE126,,, what's underneath everything the inner
Js7-OWd19PE126,,, critic is saying do they like me and
Js7-OWd19PE126,,, what's my reputation going to be when I
Js7-OWd19PE126,,, finish are they going to think I'm okay
Js7-OWd19PE127,34.09,34.23, if I'm not worried about that I have the
Js7-OWd19PE127,,, time and the space and the energy to
Js7-OWd19PE127,,, care about you to care about the
Js7-OWd19PE127,,, audience to care about the person i'm
Js7-OWd19PE127,,, making the pitch to so this is
Js7-OWd19PE127,,, incredibly important i work with people
Js7-OWd19PE128,34.25,34.38, who are in industries I work with CEOs I
Js7-OWd19PE128,,, work with people who are in the
Js7-OWd19PE128,,, Performing Arts I've worked with actors
Js7-OWd19PE128,,, who work on Broadway and who tell me you
Js7-OWd19PE128,,, know what I'm an actor i have training
Js7-OWd19PE128,,, and the hardest thing for me to do is to
Js7-OWd19PE129,34.4,34.51, stand spontaneously and talk let's say
Js7-OWd19PE129,,, to the press or when I'm being
Js7-OWd19PE129,,, interviewed about something
Js7-OWd19PE129,,, spontaneously somebody sees me on the
Js7-OWd19PE129,,, street and it's a spontaneous grab we
Js7-OWd19PE129,,, call it it's a
Js7-OWd19PE130,34.52,35.03, RAB conversation or somebody now I have
Js7-OWd19PE130,,, to talk about something and these are
Js7-OWd19PE130,,, people that are trained to be on stage
Js7-OWd19PE130,,, so can you imagine the people who aren't
Js7-OWd19PE130,,, trained to be on stage and it is all the
Js7-OWd19PE130,,, same it's kind of there's a democracy
Js7-OWd19PE131,35.05,35.15, there's an egalitarian quality to this
Js7-OWd19PE131,,, it doesn't matter one status one's
Js7-OWd19PE131,,, wealth it doesn't matter family
Js7-OWd19PE131,,, background cultural background where you
Js7-OWd19PE131,,, were born in the world how much money
Js7-OWd19PE131,,, you have and how much fame or whether
Js7-OWd19PE132,35.18,35.33, you work as a janitor everybody deals
Js7-OWd19PE132,,, with those inner critic self-doubts the
Js7-OWd19PE132,,, smart leaders are leaders who understand
Js7-OWd19PE132,,, two things and you're a leader when
Js7-OWd19PE132,,, you're making a presentation number one
Js7-OWd19PE132,,, in order to be effective I need to know
Js7-OWd19PE133,35.36,35.48, myself I need to know when my inner
Js7-OWd19PE133,,, critic shows up maybe it shows up before
Js7-OWd19PE133,,, during or after the event and I need to
Js7-OWd19PE133,,, find a way to do either self coaching or
Js7-OWd19PE133,,, get coaching to help me with that
Js7-OWd19PE133,,, because if it shows up before I'm not
Js7-OWd19PE134,35.5,36.03, going to deliver my message clearly it's
Js7-OWd19PE134,,, going to it's going to stop me from what
Js7-OWd19PE134,,, I want to say if it happens during I'm
Js7-OWd19PE134,,, going to come across as less confident
Js7-OWd19PE134,,, less confident if it happens after I
Js7-OWd19PE134,,, won't be able to enjoy my success which
Js7-OWd19PE135,36.06,36.17, is what happens very often as some of
Js7-OWd19PE135,,, you are smiling exactly you know what I
Js7-OWd19PE135,,, mean the second thing the leader
Js7-OWd19PE135,,, understands is that it's not enough to
Js7-OWd19PE135,,, just know oneself we have to understand
Js7-OWd19PE135,,, the other person too because they may be
Js7-OWd19PE136,36.19,36.29, having the same thing happen and that's
Js7-OWd19PE136,,, how we build strong teams by the way
Js7-OWd19PE136,,, this isn't a team conversation that's
Js7-OWd19PE136,,, not what this presentation is about
Js7-OWd19PE136,,, today i will just say to you how many
Js7-OWd19PE136,,, people here work in teams all right it's
Js7-OWd19PE137,36.33,36.44, a collaborative world now right it's a
Js7-OWd19PE137,,, collaborative world now baby there's no
Js7-OWd19PE137,,, more just the individual right we need
Js7-OWd19PE137,,, to be able to interface with people that
Js7-OWd19PE137,,, are around the world people that are in
Js7-OWd19PE137,,, different areas and it's all about the
Js7-OWd19PE138,36.47,37, team if I really want to have a very
Js7-OWd19PE138,,, collaborative team I need to be able to
Js7-OWd19PE138,,, anticipate what are the inner critics
Js7-OWd19PE138,,, even of my other teammates and how can I
Js7-OWd19PE138,,, help them feel more confident and grow
Js7-OWd19PE138,,, them
Js7-OWd19PE139,37,37.21, and back to the presentation and pitch
Js7-OWd19PE139,,, piece remember that we can plan we can
Js7-OWd19PE139,,, have a specific agenda and we can have
Js7-OWd19PE139,,, everything laid out even in the video or
Js7-OWd19PE139,,, the PowerPoint or the live presentation
Js7-OWd19PE139,,, we need to learn how to prepare for the
Js7-OWd19PE140,37.26,37.39, unexpected to be ready for the
Js7-OWd19PE140,,, unexpected to be ready for the fact that
Js7-OWd19PE140,,, this PowerPoint slides don't work
Js7-OWd19PE140,,, because somehow the cable is frayed at
Js7-OWd19PE140,,, the end it's broken can't use the
Js7-OWd19PE140,,, powerpoint what do you do now this
Js7-OWd19PE141,37.41,37.54, happened to somebody I know recently who
Js7-OWd19PE141,,, is giving a talk in a company I was at
Js7-OWd19PE141,,, he said I froze his hands got very wet
Js7-OWd19PE141,,, his mouth was dry he's I didn't know
Js7-OWd19PE141,,, what to say I said well you know your
Js7-OWd19PE141,,, material right he's I know I lost every
Js7-OWd19PE142,37.57,38.1, thought in my mind so we have to almost
Js7-OWd19PE142,,, go into the moment expecting that we
Js7-OWd19PE142,,, don't have everything we think we'll
Js7-OWd19PE142,,, need and always have a back-up plan
Js7-OWd19PE142,,, always have a plan B and a Plan C in
Js7-OWd19PE142,,, case plan B doesn't work you need we
Js7-OWd19PE143,38.14,38.28, need to know our ideas well enough so
Js7-OWd19PE143,,, that you could pitch your idea alone
Js7-OWd19PE143,,, with one other person with only a candle
Js7-OWd19PE143,,, for your light in the middle of a desert
Js7-OWd19PE143,,, where there's no no food and no water
Js7-OWd19PE143,,, right though you can't depend on
Js7-OWd19PE144,38.31,38.41, anything and it's just you in that human
Js7-OWd19PE144,,, being and of course I'm saying that with
Js7-OWd19PE144,,, humor and I also mean it seriously so
Js7-OWd19PE144,,, have a back-up plan feel comfortable
Js7-OWd19PE144,,, enough that you don't have to rely on
Js7-OWd19PE144,,, the technology that you're going to be
Js7-OWd19PE145,38.42,38.58, utilizing now as far as the video
Js7-OWd19PE145,,, presentations I want to make some points
Js7-OWd19PE145,,, about that everything is created in
Js7-OWd19PE145,,, video and in the audio applications that
Js7-OWd19PE145,,, are utilized like voiceover and
Js7-OWd19PE145,,, certainly any music nowadays at a very
Js7-OWd19PE146,39.01,39.12, high level okay what we're watching
Js7-OWd19PE146,,, online has become increasingly
Js7-OWd19PE146,,, sophisticated if we look at what was put
Js7-OWd19PE146,,, on the internet
Js7-OWd19PE146,,, are on the web we used to call it right
Js7-OWd19PE146,,, in 1998 1999 our 2000 it we have very
Js7-OWd19PE147,39.17,39.28, different quality visually than what we
Js7-OWd19PE147,,, see today right things have really
Js7-OWd19PE147,,, changed so that means that we all have
Js7-OWd19PE147,,, to up our game in terms of the visual
Js7-OWd19PE147,,, material that we put out online because
Js7-OWd19PE147,,, there's a lot of competition and
Js7-OWd19PE148,39.29,39.42, competing imagery for us to look at so
Js7-OWd19PE148,,, in terms of video a couple of things are
Js7-OWd19PE148,,, very important that I want to mention
Js7-OWd19PE148,,, make sure you don't spread your budget
Js7-OWd19PE148,,, dollars too thin to try to do too many
Js7-OWd19PE148,,, fancy things in video and then therefore
Js7-OWd19PE149,39.44,40, sacrifice the basic quality of the video
Js7-OWd19PE149,,, as well as its accessibility to the user
Js7-OWd19PE149,,, make sure it's downloadable effectively
Js7-OWd19PE149,,, across platforms make sure that it is
Js7-OWd19PE149,,, clear in varying kinds of devices mobile
Js7-OWd19PE149,,, devices you know about the transition
Js7-OWd19PE150,40.02,40.12, that's happening now in terms of
Js7-OWd19PE150,,, websites and Google and and android
Js7-OWd19PE150,,, phones and and phones have to now be the
Js7-OWd19PE150,,, websites have to be designed so that
Js7-OWd19PE150,,, they are applicable to phones this is a
Js7-OWd19PE150,,, big deal people are using these devices
Js7-OWd19PE151,40.14,40.27, to view most of the data that's coming
Js7-OWd19PE151,,, in this is number one it's very
Js7-OWd19PE151,,, important so rather than spending your
Js7-OWd19PE151,,, dollars on something else that has to be
Js7-OWd19PE151,,, essential secondly the visual imagery in
Js7-OWd19PE151,,, Hollywood there's somebody called the
Js7-OWd19PE152,40.31,40.43, cinematographer and the designer there's
Js7-OWd19PE152,,, a designer who looks at everything
Js7-OWd19PE152,,, visual that comes across that screen now
Js7-OWd19PE152,,, when we're at working in startups and we
Js7-OWd19PE152,,, have low budgets we can't afford to go
Js7-OWd19PE152,,, buy some designer who might be have a
Js7-OWd19PE153,40.46,41, higher salary than my entire project
Js7-OWd19PE153,,, right what we can do however is think
Js7-OWd19PE153,,, smart a we can find people we know who
Js7-OWd19PE153,,, have a visual sense to help us
Js7-OWd19PE153,,, especially if we tend to be engineers
Js7-OWd19PE153,,, how many engineers are in the room hello
Js7-OWd19PE154,41.03,41.17, I love working with engineers obviously
Js7-OWd19PE154,,, I spend a lot of time at MIT so I love
Js7-OWd19PE154,,, working with engineers and many of you
Js7-OWd19PE154,,, have a very strong design sense who here
Js7-OWd19PE154,,, is in the design aspect who does
Js7-OWd19PE154,,, design working in various graphic
Js7-OWd19PE155,41.21,41.33, formats anybody here working software
Js7-OWd19PE155,,, and and implementing the code anybody
Js7-OWd19PE155,,, working code so I'm mentioning all these
Js7-OWd19PE155,,, different skill basis because I know
Js7-OWd19PE155,,, that some of us have more or less
Js7-OWd19PE155,,, strength in terms of seeing the visual
Js7-OWd19PE156,41.35,41.47, design seeing the visual design is not
Js7-OWd19PE156,,, unlike being able to feel the
Js7-OWd19PE156,,, relationship with the person because
Js7-OWd19PE156,,, design is sending like you said body
Js7-OWd19PE156,,, talk or body language design and visual
Js7-OWd19PE156,,, images are sending a signal to the
Js7-OWd19PE157,41.49,41.59, people in the audience so if you're
Js7-OWd19PE157,,, trying to tell something somebody
Js7-OWd19PE157,,, something very important but behind you
Js7-OWd19PE157,,, you have an image that makes people
Js7-OWd19PE157,,, laugh then you're going to be having a
Js7-OWd19PE157,,, cacophony an argument between what
Js7-OWd19PE158,42.01,42.12, you're saying and the visual behind you
Js7-OWd19PE158,,, so find people who can help you work
Js7-OWd19PE158,,, with that visual keep it simple keep it
Js7-OWd19PE158,,, clear and in connection to what I said
Js7-OWd19PE158,,, about the hook in the beginning with
Js7-OWd19PE158,,, your words and what you say your hook
Js7-OWd19PE159,42.15,42.28, has to be simple clear get to the point
Js7-OWd19PE159,,, and as Lee said at the very beginning
Js7-OWd19PE159,,, make sure you get to the hook right away
Js7-OWd19PE159,,, don't spend your first time your first
Js7-OWd19PE159,,, precious moments leading up to a big
Js7-OWd19PE159,,, introduction remember this people form
Js7-OWd19PE160,42.32,42.49, an impression of you your pitch and your
Js7-OWd19PE160,,, idea within the first five to ten
Js7-OWd19PE160,,, seconds ten seconds I already have an
Js7-OWd19PE160,,, impression of you sometimes one second
Js7-OWd19PE160,,, there is actually a video application
Js7-OWd19PE160,,, that is online that helps people look at
Js7-OWd19PE161,42.52,43.05, our internal biases against certain
Js7-OWd19PE161,,, races I actually did it it's a very
Js7-OWd19PE161,,, powerful thing I don't remember the name
Js7-OWd19PE161,,, of it right now but if you want it email
Js7-OWd19PE161,,, me and I'll get it and what it shows is
Js7-OWd19PE161,,, very fast images and you have to
Js7-OWd19PE162,43.08,43.19, immediately click something according to
Js7-OWd19PE162,,, your response to what you see and it
Js7-OWd19PE162,,, helps you understand if you have any
Js7-OWd19PE162,,, internalize biases or biases against
Js7-OWd19PE162,,, people who are from African American
Js7-OWd19PE162,,, descent in the case of what i was
Js7-OWd19PE163,43.21,43.35, looking at or people from other cultures
Js7-OWd19PE163,,, and this is happening very very very
Js7-OWd19PE163,,, fast so we form an impression and our
Js7-OWd19PE163,,, intern
Js7-OWd19PE163,,, all judgment is affected and activated
Js7-OWd19PE163,,, often within a second because this thing
Js7-OWd19PE164,43.37,43.5, i was looking at in this application was
Js7-OWd19PE164,,, less than a second very fast so when
Js7-OWd19PE164,,, you're giving your pitch make sure you
Js7-OWd19PE164,,, don't waste those opening moments and
Js7-OWd19PE164,,, give people time to let their mind
Js7-OWd19PE164,,, wander or make an impression about you
Js7-OWd19PE165,43.52,44.03, and put you in a box that has nothing to
Js7-OWd19PE165,,, do with who you are but rather that box
Js7-OWd19PE165,,, might be a reflection of the fact that
Js7-OWd19PE165,,, you are a little nervous about starting
Js7-OWd19PE165,,, and you didn't want to seem rude come
Js7-OWd19PE165,,, right out there with the hook now I want
Js7-OWd19PE166,44.05,44.16, to just pause before I go on and say
Js7-OWd19PE166,,, this sometimes mistakes happen where
Js7-OWd19PE166,,, people think I mean you have to be out
Js7-OWd19PE166,,, there and in their face and really
Js7-OWd19PE166,,, selling it from the beginning and
Js7-OWd19PE166,,, hooking because you know you hear the
Js7-OWd19PE167,44.18,44.34, word hook and you think of fishing right
Js7-OWd19PE167,,, and you want to throw the hook out and
Js7-OWd19PE167,,, grab the fish no it's not aggressive or
Js7-OWd19PE167,,, hook is something soft that happens in a
Js7-OWd19PE167,,, very human way that makes a person stop
Js7-OWd19PE167,,, and pay attention I say soft because
Js7-OWd19PE168,44.38,44.51, what I mean is if it comes to sharp the
Js7-OWd19PE168,,, hook it can actually push the person
Js7-OWd19PE168,,, back so you want to make that hook
Js7-OWd19PE168,,, something that feels like an invitation
Js7-OWd19PE168,,, that makes the person want to say oh
Js7-OWd19PE168,,, yeah I'd like to dialogue with you about
Js7-OWd19PE169,44.54,45.05, that as I said a moment ago the word
Js7-OWd19PE169,,, dialogue right and getting back to the
Js7-OWd19PE169,,, video and the production values which is
Js7-OWd19PE169,,, really what I'm talking about now we
Js7-OWd19PE169,,, have to make sure we're looking at the
Js7-OWd19PE169,,, production values of whatever we're
Js7-OWd19PE170,45.07,45.19, creating in these business pitch pieces
Js7-OWd19PE170,,, that we have because production values
Js7-OWd19PE170,,, are crucial and I mean you know the
Js7-OWd19PE170,,, quality of the sound the quality of the
Js7-OWd19PE170,,, visual and the quality of also the
Js7-OWd19PE170,,, actors remember this have any of you
Js7-OWd19PE171,45.23,45.38, used voiceover an audio where somebody
Js7-OWd19PE171,,, is speaking in your pitches raise your
Js7-OWd19PE171,,, hand if you have yes remember this the
Js7-OWd19PE171,,, voice-over is essential voiceover is an
Js7-OWd19PE171,,, art it is an art form that requires
Js7-OWd19PE171,,, training it isn't acting actually what
Js7-OWd19PE172,45.4,45.57, we call it now is voice artists or
Js7-OWd19PE172,,, actors I do voiceover where my voice is
Js7-OWd19PE172,,, used in narrations for museums you know
Js7-OWd19PE172,,, I might go and work at a ficial
Js7-OWd19PE172,,, institution and I am speaking the words
Js7-OWd19PE172,,, of the product that they are trying to
Js7-OWd19PE173,45.58,46.11, promote or it could be anywhere could be
Js7-OWd19PE173,,, television commercial and people who are
Js7-OWd19PE173,,, trained in this art will tell you two
Js7-OWd19PE173,,, things the first part of it is this in
Js7-OWd19PE173,,, voiceover you never try to sound like
Js7-OWd19PE173,,, you're an authority you try to speak to
Js7-OWd19PE174,46.14,46.27, the human being that's in front of you
Js7-OWd19PE174,,, everything I just said and the second
Js7-OWd19PE174,,, thing is voiceover is not something that
Js7-OWd19PE174,,, you can learn in a day or an hour and
Js7-OWd19PE174,,, sometimes the person who has the idea
Js7-OWd19PE174,,, for the project and the person who has
Js7-OWd19PE175,46.3,46.4, the startup baby that you've been
Js7-OWd19PE175,,, holding in your belly you know being
Js7-OWd19PE175,,, pregt with for all these years and
Js7-OWd19PE175,,, now you're giving birth even though you
Js7-OWd19PE175,,, love the project you may not be the best
Js7-OWd19PE175,,, person to do the voiceover because you
Js7-OWd19PE176,46.43,46.56, may not have that training so this is
Js7-OWd19PE176,,, called knowing how to grow a team to
Js7-OWd19PE176,,, give the opportunity for somebody else
Js7-OWd19PE176,,, to complete you as a leader at Sloan
Js7-OWd19PE176,,, there is a professor called Deborah
Js7-OWd19PE176,,, ancona who talks about the notion of the
Js7-OWd19PE178,46.58,47.17, incomplete leader and the incomplete
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, leader says I know that I don't have all
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, the tools and skills I don't have every
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, single quality perfectly developed and
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, so what I do now I have to do is find
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, people who can help to complete what is
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, missing so find people who can be very
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, effective in helping you to deliver the
Js7-OWd19PE178,,, product in the best possible quality
3ozZnT72XbM1,0,0.17, g'day everybody patrick here
3ozZnT72XbM1,,, um today we are going to
3ozZnT72XbM1,,, talk about sign posting language
3ozZnT72XbM1,,, sign posting language
3ozZnT72XbM1,,, and you can see here on the screen
3ozZnT72XbM1,,, um you know i'm on a website
3ozZnT72XbM2,0.21,0.39, uh called ielts buddy
3ozZnT72XbM2,,, and uh that's obviously a website
3ozZnT72XbM2,,, dedicated
3ozZnT72XbM2,,, to prepare to prepare the students
3ozZnT72XbM2,,, for ielts exams but this sign posting
3ozZnT72XbM2,,, language is not only important for
3ozZnT72XbM3,0.42,1.04, ielts it's important for any exam
3ozZnT72XbM3,,, any writing text
3ozZnT72XbM3,,, any writing piece that you are producing
3ozZnT72XbM3,,, but mainly we hear about sign posting
3ozZnT72XbM3,,, when we give presentations
3ozZnT72XbM3,,, or lectures okay
3ozZnT72XbM4,1.08,1.23, presentations or lectures when you are
3ozZnT72XbM4,,, giving a lecture or giving a
3ozZnT72XbM4,,, presentation to a
3ozZnT72XbM4,,, group of people an audience
3ozZnT72XbM4,,, it's very important to use sign posting
3ozZnT72XbM4,,, language and let me explain
3ozZnT72XbM5,1.26,1.46, what sign posting language is
3ozZnT72XbM5,,, so sign posting anyway
3ozZnT72XbM5,,, is what you do
3ozZnT72XbM5,,, to make sure that the listener
3ozZnT72XbM5,,, knows what you are talking about
3ozZnT72XbM5,,, and what will you be talking about
3ozZnT72XbM6,1.5,2.09, imagine a little child
3ozZnT72XbM6,,, right imagine well actually
3ozZnT72XbM6,,, imagine a father or a mother
3ozZnT72XbM6,,, or an adult holding the hand
3ozZnT72XbM6,,, of a child while walking in the street
3ozZnT72XbM6,,, if you don't hold the child's hand
3ozZnT72XbM7,2.13,2.26, the child might get
3ozZnT72XbM7,,, lost and so just
3ozZnT72XbM7,,, understanding that is very important for
3ozZnT72XbM7,,, you
3ozZnT72XbM7,,, because there's a connection between
3ozZnT72XbM7,,, this image of you holding as an adult
3ozZnT72XbM8,2.29,2.45, you holding the hand of a child so
3ozZnT72XbM8,,, the child will not get lost
3ozZnT72XbM8,,, strong connection between this image and
3ozZnT72XbM8,,, and that
3ozZnT72XbM8,,, of a presenter or a lecturer
3ozZnT72XbM8,,, using sign post
3ozZnT72XbM9,2.49,3.08, right to help the audience
3ozZnT72XbM9,,, stay attentive and not get lost
3ozZnT72XbM9,,, if you don't use signed posting language
3ozZnT72XbM9,,, your audience might just
3ozZnT72XbM9,,, get lost and you cannot
3ozZnT72XbM9,,, find them again then you end up talking
3ozZnT72XbM10,3.12,3.26, and talking and talking and they
3ozZnT72XbM10,,, are completely sleeping okay
3ozZnT72XbM10,,, they probably doze off they'll take a
3ozZnT72XbM10,,, nap
3ozZnT72XbM10,,, all right and they will probably lose
3ozZnT72XbM10,,, interest they lose interest
3ozZnT72XbM11,3.29,3.42, and you cannot afford that when you are
3ozZnT72XbM11,,, giving a talk
3ozZnT72XbM11,,, when you are delivering a presentation
3ozZnT72XbM11,,, or a lecture of any kind
3ozZnT72XbM11,,, you cannot take that risk you need to
3ozZnT72XbM11,,, make sure
3ozZnT72XbM12,3.44,3.58, that your audience is always
3ozZnT72XbM12,,, always attentive that means
3ozZnT72XbM12,,, paying attention and listening to you
3ozZnT72XbM12,,, and
3ozZnT72XbM12,,, is aware your audience is aware
3ozZnT72XbM12,,, of what you are going to talk about
3ozZnT72XbM13,4.01,4.14, what you just talked about and what will
3ozZnT72XbM13,,, you be
3ozZnT72XbM13,,, talking about okay all these things are
3ozZnT72XbM13,,, very important and that's what sign
3ozZnT72XbM13,,, posting language is
3ozZnT72XbM13,,, okay so this
3ozZnT72XbM14,4.17,4.29, article here and i'm going to include
3ozZnT72XbM14,,, the link to the article
3ozZnT72XbM14,,, on the screen it's good for you to read

3ozZnT72XbM14,,, that this is important for ielts well
3ozZnT72XbM15,4.3,4.41, it's not only important for ielts it's
3ozZnT72XbM15,,, important for
3ozZnT72XbM15,,, any talk that you give and even it's
3ozZnT72XbM15,,, important in writing

3ozZnT72XbM17,,, pick
3ozZnT72XbM17,,, a topic for the presentation and
3ozZnT72XbM18,5.14,5.25, i'm going to be using the signed posting
3ozZnT72XbM18,,, language
3ozZnT72XbM18,,, with that topic all right so
3ozZnT72XbM18,,, so i'm not going to give you a
3ozZnT72XbM18,,, presentation about this topic but
3ozZnT72XbM18,,, i'm going to use this topic as an
3ozZnT72XbM19,5.27,5.39, example
3ozZnT72XbM19,,, when i read the phrases for you the sign
3ozZnT72XbM19,,, posting language
3ozZnT72XbM19,,, okay so like
3ozZnT72XbM19,,, anything else in english you know in the
3ozZnT72XbM19,,, academic world like anything else
3ozZnT72XbM20,5.43,6.02, we have an introduction
3ozZnT72XbM20,,, we have a body and we have a conclusion
3ozZnT72XbM20,,, we have a body and we have a conclusion
3ozZnT72XbM20,,, presentations are not different okay
3ozZnT72XbM20,,, presentations and lectures
3ozZnT72XbM20,,, have the same characteristics they have
3ozZnT72XbM20,,, an
3ozZnT72XbM21,6.03,6.14, introduction they have a body and they
3ozZnT72XbM21,,, have a conclusion
3ozZnT72XbM21,,, so the first thing that you do when you
3ozZnT72XbM21,,, actually
3ozZnT72XbM21,,, open up a presentation when you start a
3ozZnT72XbM21,,, presentation
3ozZnT72XbM22,6.15,6.31, the first thing you do is you introduce
3ozZnT72XbM22,,, the topic of your presentation
3ozZnT72XbM22,,, okay so in other words for example you
3ozZnT72XbM22,,, say
3ozZnT72XbM22,,, today we're going to talk about
3ozZnT72XbM22,,, today we're going to talk about see
3ozZnT72XbM23,6.34,6.48, talk is the key word today we're going
3ozZnT72XbM23,,, to talk about
3ozZnT72XbM23,,, and now because you have about
3ozZnT72XbM23,,, you need to actually have a noun
3ozZnT72XbM23,,, after it you cannot use a verb
3ozZnT72XbM23,,, you can use a gerund or you can use
3ozZnT72XbM24,6.52,7.03, a noun any noun but you have to use a
3ozZnT72XbM24,,, noun
3ozZnT72XbM24,,, so for example you can say today we're
3ozZnT72XbM24,,, going to talk about
3ozZnT72XbM24,,, the greatest challenges of
3ozZnT72XbM24,,, international students studying in

3ozZnT72XbM27,,, find
3ozZnT72XbM28,7.56,8.06, synonyms and you have to use

3ozZnT72XbM52,,, so i will see i'm not going to say
3ozZnT72XbM52,,, points i'm going to say
3ozZnT72XbM53,14.4,14.55, three challenges and maybe i might add
3ozZnT72XbM53,,, something so in today's lecture
3ozZnT72XbM53,,, i'm going to cover three great
3ozZnT72XbM53,,, challenges international students
3ozZnT72XbM53,,, face or encounter or
3ozZnT72XbM53,,, struggle to overcome alright see i there
3ozZnT72XbM54,14.58,15.12, are different ways to do it
3ozZnT72XbM54,,, alright so you can see i'm going to
3ozZnT72XbM54,,, divide i'm going to divide this talk
3ozZnT72XbM54,,, into three parts
3ozZnT72XbM54,,, okay i'm going to divide this talk
3ozZnT72XbM54,,, into three parts and then you can say
3ozZnT72XbM55,15.15,15.29, and each part will be looking at a
3ozZnT72XbM55,,, difficult
3ozZnT72XbM55,,, challenge okay
3ozZnT72XbM55,,, now so what you did here you actually
3ozZnT72XbM55,,, divided that means you split you divided
3ozZnT72XbM55,,, you
3ozZnT72XbM56,15.3,15.45, you you you cut
3ozZnT72XbM56,,, your presentation into three parts you
3ozZnT72XbM56,,, are telling
3ozZnT72XbM56,,, the audience to expect hearing
3ozZnT72XbM56,,, about three different points
3ozZnT72XbM56,,, three different areas three different
3ozZnT72XbM57,15.48,16.02, challenges three different problems you
3ozZnT72XbM57,,, can call them
3ozZnT72XbM57,,, whatever you want but now there is that
3ozZnT72XbM57,,, structure in the audience's head
3ozZnT72XbM57,,, that they know what to expect they have
3ozZnT72XbM57,,, an idea
3ozZnT72XbM58,16.03,16.14, you introduce the topic first and now
3ozZnT72XbM58,,, you are telling them that they're going
3ozZnT72XbM58,,, to hear
3ozZnT72XbM58,,, three challenges they're going to hear
3ozZnT72XbM58,,, about three challenges or three
3ozZnT72XbM58,,, solutions or three areas or whatever
3ozZnT72XbM59,16.17,16.3, that may be
3ozZnT72XbM59,,, okay the important thing is you are
3ozZnT72XbM59,,, being clear
3ozZnT72XbM59,,, about what the structure looks like in
3ozZnT72XbM59,,, this presentation
3ozZnT72XbM59,,, next first we'll look at so you can say
3ozZnT72XbM60,16.32,16.44, first
3ozZnT72XbM60,,, and then and finally
3ozZnT72XbM60,,, so this way you are um creating that
3ozZnT72XbM60,,, structure in your audience's head that's
3ozZnT72XbM60,,, very important
3ozZnT72XbM60,,, okay so you can say first we'll look at
3ozZnT72XbM61,16.48,17.01, um at culture shock that's one challenge
3ozZnT72XbM61,,, that international students face
3ozZnT72XbM61,,, so you say first we'll look at culture
3ozZnT72XbM61,,, shock
3ozZnT72XbM61,,, then we'll go on to talk about the
3ozZnT72XbM61,,, difficulties
3ozZnT72XbM62,17.03,17.17, of learning a foreign language
3ozZnT72XbM62,,, and their impact on the student's
3ozZnT72XbM62,,, experience
3ozZnT72XbM62,,, and finally i'll touch on the ficial
3ozZnT72XbM62,,, problems
3ozZnT72XbM62,,, and try to offer some solutions to all
3ozZnT72XbM63,17.2,17.3, three
3ozZnT72XbM63,,, challenges so okay so now i'm
3ozZnT72XbM63,,, i'm also adding that i will give you an
3ozZnT72XbM63,,, idea of
3ozZnT72XbM63,,, what some of the solutions might be to
3ozZnT72XbM63,,, your problems okay
3ozZnT72XbM64,17.32,17.44, but so now the audience knows
3ozZnT72XbM64,,, that they expect to hear about the first
3ozZnT72XbM64,,, problem
3ozZnT72XbM64,,, the second problem and the third problem
3ozZnT72XbM64,,, there are only three problems so they
3ozZnT72XbM64,,, are ready to hear about
3ozZnT72XbM65,17.46,17.57, three not four not five but they are
3ozZnT72XbM65,,, ready to hear about
3ozZnT72XbM65,,, three problems and they hear uh
3ozZnT72XbM65,,, they're waiting to hear about the
3ozZnT72XbM65,,, challenges and the solutions at the end
3ozZnT72XbM65,,, that you're going to recommend
3ozZnT72XbM66,18,18.17, to international students so they can
3ozZnT72XbM66,,, overcome those challenges okay
3ozZnT72XbM66,,, all right so now we've just
3ozZnT72XbM66,,, covered right and how you explain the
3ozZnT72XbM66,,, structure of your presentation
3ozZnT72XbM66,,, to your audience okay
3ozZnT72XbM67,18.2,18.35, so now we've covered how you can explain
3ozZnT72XbM67,,, the structure of your presentation to
3ozZnT72XbM67,,, your audience
3ozZnT72XbM67,,, now i'd like to move on to um
3ozZnT72XbM67,,, to the phrases or the sentences that we
3ozZnT72XbM67,,, use
3ozZnT72XbM68,18.36,18.52, to introduce our first section
3ozZnT72XbM68,,, okay so we can start by let's start by
3ozZnT72XbM68,,, talking about
3ozZnT72XbM68,,, let's start by talking about remember
3ozZnT72XbM68,,, if you have about so that's a
3ozZnT72XbM68,,, preposition if you have about then you
3ozZnT72XbM69,18.55,19.04, have to
3ozZnT72XbM69,,, use a noun after it so you can say
3ozZnT72XbM69,,, something like
3ozZnT72XbM69,,, let's start by talking about culture
3ozZnT72XbM69,,, shock
3ozZnT72XbM69,,, if you remember i said before when i
3ozZnT72XbM70,19.06,19.19, introduced
3ozZnT72XbM70,,, or when i uh rather when i talked about
3ozZnT72XbM70,,, the structure of the presentation
3ozZnT72XbM70,,, i said that i'll be dividing my talk
3ozZnT72XbM70,,, into three parts or three challenges
3ozZnT72XbM70,,, okay and then now it's time to introduce
3ozZnT72XbM71,19.24,19.34, what is the first point and the first
3ozZnT72XbM71,,, point
3ozZnT72XbM71,,, is culture shock so i'll say let's start
3ozZnT72XbM71,,, by talking about culture shock let's
3ozZnT72XbM71,,, start
3ozZnT72XbM71,,, by talking about culture shock or
3ozZnT72XbM72,19.38,19.52, to begin to begin
3ozZnT72XbM72,,, okay so what do i say to begin let me
3ozZnT72XbM72,,, explain
3ozZnT72XbM72,,, what a culture shock actually
3ozZnT72XbM72,,, is ah so i started
3ozZnT72XbM72,,, my first section by defining
3ozZnT72XbM73,19.55,20.07, the key term of
3ozZnT72XbM73,,, my presentation the key term one of the
3ozZnT72XbM73,,, key terms
3ozZnT72XbM73,,, is culture shock because it's one of the
3ozZnT72XbM73,,, challenges
3ozZnT72XbM73,,, so now in other words i'm actually
3ozZnT72XbM74,20.11,20.26, explaining the topic sentence the topic
3ozZnT72XbM74,,, sentence
3ozZnT72XbM74,,, the the first the key word the key word
3ozZnT72XbM74,,, of the first section is culture shock
3ozZnT72XbM74,,, so there is no better way to start your
3ozZnT72XbM74,,, section your first section and then
3ozZnT72XbM75,20.29,20.45, defining
3ozZnT72XbM75,,, the key term of that section or defining
3ozZnT72XbM75,,, the key topic of that section which is
3ozZnT72XbM75,,, culture shock so to begin let me explain
3ozZnT72XbM75,,, what a culture shock actually
3ozZnT72XbM75,,, is or you can say
3ozZnT72XbM76,20.48,21.07, firstly um i'd like to define the term
3ozZnT72XbM76,,, culture shock firstly i'd like to define
3ozZnT72XbM76,,, i'd like i would like i'd like to define
3ozZnT72XbM76,,, i'd like to define the term
3ozZnT72XbM76,,, culture shock
3ozZnT72XbM76,,, which again is very important because
3ozZnT72XbM77,21.1,21.23, you are
3ozZnT72XbM77,,, defining the key term of your topic
3ozZnT72XbM77,,, or you can say i'll start with culture
3ozZnT72XbM77,,, shock
3ozZnT72XbM77,,, simple i'll start with culture shock
3ozZnT72XbM77,,, or you can say uh the first challenge
3ozZnT72XbM78,21.26,21.35, which
3ozZnT72XbM78,,, i'm certain many of you are familiar
3ozZnT72XbM78,,, with
3ozZnT72XbM78,,, i mean it depends who your audience is
3ozZnT72XbM78,,, not all audiences
3ozZnT72XbM78,,, are familiar with your topic
3ozZnT72XbM79,21.38,21.49, so you need to know your audience when
3ozZnT72XbM79,,, you are giving a presentation
3ozZnT72XbM79,,, you need to know who you are giving your
3ozZnT72XbM79,,, presentation to
3ozZnT72XbM79,,, who are you delivering your presentation
3ozZnT72XbM79,,, to
3ozZnT72XbM80,21.5,22.02, how much does your audience know about
3ozZnT72XbM80,,, the topic
3ozZnT72XbM80,,, what is the level of their knowledge of
3ozZnT72XbM80,,, the topic
3ozZnT72XbM80,,, how aware of the topic are they
3ozZnT72XbM80,,, so you need to know your audience but
3ozZnT72XbM81,22.03,22.15, let's assume that your audience knows
3ozZnT72XbM81,,, something about it okay
3ozZnT72XbM81,,, so we'll say uh the first challenge
3ozZnT72XbM81,,, which i'm certain that means i'm sure
3ozZnT72XbM81,,, the first
3ozZnT72XbM81,,, challenge which i'm certain many of you
3ozZnT72XbM82,22.17,22.29, are familiar with
3ozZnT72XbM82,,, is culture shock okay
3ozZnT72XbM82,,, so next is um

3ozZnT72XbM107,28.5,29.04, in australia and as we've discussed
3ozZnT72XbM107,,, those are a b and c and the best way to
3ozZnT72XbM107,,, handle them
3ozZnT72XbM107,,, is by doing a b and c
3ozZnT72XbM107,,, the main goal of
3ozZnT72XbM107,,, using signed posting language
3ozZnT72XbM108,29.07,29.27, is to really keep the audience

XyRjKCT_wrk1,0,0.14, when it comes to presenting online most
XyRjKCT_wrk1,,, of what we see is pretty in fact if
XyRjKCT_wrk1,,, you're invited to watch an online
XyRjKCT_wrk1,,, presentation or attend an online virtual
XyRjKCT_wrk1,,, meeting your expectations are pretty low
XyRjKCT_wrk1,,, well these are five top tips to make
XyRjKCT_wrk2,0.17,0.3, sure you deliver awesome content that
XyRjKCT_wrk2,,, everybody will remember now it's worth
XyRjKCT_wrk2,,, saying I'm assuming in this video that
XyRjKCT_wrk2,,, you're going to be either filming on
XyRjKCT_wrk2,,, your phone or on your laptop as most
XyRjKCT_wrk2,,, people would be tip number one think
XyRjKCT_wrk3,0.34,0.46, about the setting that you are in so
XyRjKCT_wrk3,,, when you're delivering an online
XyRjKCT_wrk3,,, presentation really think about your
XyRjKCT_wrk3,,, background what's behind you you don't
XyRjKCT_wrk3,,, want anything that's too distracting so
XyRjKCT_wrk3,,, not in the kitchen with all the kitchen
XyRjKCT_wrk4,0.48,1, crap behind you you want something
XyRjKCT_wrk4,,, that's plain and that looks professional
XyRjKCT_wrk4,,, just use a backdrop like I'm using now
XyRjKCT_wrk4,,, this is just a standard black backdrop
XyRjKCT_wrk4,,, and you can buy these on Amazon and
XyRjKCT_wrk4,,, they're really not that expensive the
XyRjKCT_wrk5,1.02,1.16, same you can get a stand to hold your
XyRjKCT_wrk5,,, backdrop on as well so I'd really
XyRjKCT_wrk5,,, consider investing in one of those if
XyRjKCT_wrk5,,, you're going to be doing more online
XyRjKCT_wrk5,,, presentations think about how quiet the
XyRjKCT_wrk5,,, area is that you're presenting in so you
XyRjKCT_wrk6,1.18,1.33, don't want any background noise close
XyRjKCT_wrk6,,, the windows make it as quiet as possible
XyRjKCT_wrk6,,, because when you're presenting online
XyRjKCT_wrk6,,, the sound is really important and think
XyRjKCT_wrk6,,, about the lighting as well so you want
XyRjKCT_wrk6,,, the space that you're in to be really
XyRjKCT_wrk7,1.35,1.46, well lit so turn the lights on if
XyRjKCT_wrk7,,, there's a window in the room that you're
XyRjKCT_wrk7,,, in make sure that that is in front of
XyRjKCT_wrk7,,, you and basically that no lighting
XyRjKCT_wrk7,,, source is directly behind you because
XyRjKCT_wrk7,,, what you'll find is it will look like
XyRjKCT_wrk8,1.48,2.03, you're in darkness to the viewers so
XyRjKCT_wrk8,,, really think about the setting that
XyRjKCT_wrk8,,, you're in number two stand up if you
XyRjKCT_wrk8,,, stand up you will naturally deliver a
XyRjKCT_wrk8,,, much better presentation you will look
XyRjKCT_wrk8,,, like you are performing far too often
XyRjKCT_wrk9,2.06,2.18, when we sit and we watch an online
XyRjKCT_wrk9,,, presentation we're watching somebody sat
XyRjKCT_wrk9,,, at the table slunt down
XyRjKCT_wrk9,,, it's hard to present from this point of
XyRjKCT_wrk9,,, view it looks like they don't care it's
XyRjKCT_wrk9,,, hard to retain somebody's attention when
XyRjKCT_wrk10,2.21,2.34, you look like that so stand up and
XyRjKCT_wrk10,,, really give it a presentation style it
XyRjKCT_wrk10,,, will shock the audience into listening
XyRjKCT_wrk10,,, because most of what they see in online
XyRjKCT_wrk10,,, presentations is crap and it will make
XyRjKCT_wrk10,,, them listen
XyRjKCT_wrk11,2.35,2.49, so deliver a performance by standing up
XyRjKCT_wrk11,,, now if you're going to stand up you need
XyRjKCT_wrk11,,, to raise your laptop up higher so that
XyRjKCT_wrk11,,, the lens of the camera is in your direct
XyRjKCT_wrk11,,, eyeline you do not want to be looking
XyRjKCT_wrk11,,, down at your camera lens because then
XyRjKCT_wrk12,2.52,3.06, all your audience can see is the inside
XyRjKCT_wrk12,,, of your nose cavity so standing up will
XyRjKCT_wrk12,,, just naturally make you deliver a better
XyRjKCT_wrk12,,, presentation and that is key when
XyRjKCT_wrk12,,, delivering a presentation online you are
XyRjKCT_wrk12,,, still performing so stand up and perform
XyRjKCT_wrk13,3.1,3.27, tip number three rehearse you need to
XyRjKCT_wrk13,,, treat your online presentation as you
XyRjKCT_wrk13,,, would a presentation on a stage in front
XyRjKCT_wrk13,,, of 200 people so practice get set up get
XyRjKCT_wrk13,,, the camera set up and practice
XyRjKCT_wrk13,,, performing to that camera lens tip
XyRjKCT_wrk14,3.3,3.43, number four dress to impress how often
XyRjKCT_wrk14,,, do we watch people presenting online and
XyRjKCT_wrk14,,, it looks like they've made no effort at
XyRjKCT_wrk14,,, all you need to treat your online
XyRjKCT_wrk14,,, presentation in the same way you would a
XyRjKCT_wrk14,,, performance in front of 200 people so
XyRjKCT_wrk15,3.46,3.58, dress to impress if it's casual
XyRjKCT_wrk15,,, something where you're maybe just
XyRjKCT_wrk15,,, talking to colleagues something casual
XyRjKCT_wrk15,,, like this would work but maybe if you're
XyRjKCT_wrk15,,, presenting to customers you need to
XyRjKCT_wrk15,,, dress smarter something like this the
XyRjKCT_wrk16,4.01,4.12, important thing to remember with online
XyRjKCT_wrk16,,, presentations is you need to treat it as
XyRjKCT_wrk16,,, you would a presentation in front of a
XyRjKCT_wrk16,,, live audience so when it comes to what
XyRjKCT_wrk16,,, to wear
XyRjKCT_wrk16,,, my advice is mirror the audience if
XyRjKCT_wrk17,4.14,4.26, you're presenting to colleagues then you
XyRjKCT_wrk17,,, can go with casual but if you're
XyRjKCT_wrk17,,, presenting to customers I'd always go
XyRjKCT_wrk17,,, with smart think about what you would be
XyRjKCT_wrk17,,, wearing if you were on
XyRjKCT_wrk17,,, and number five think about your
XyRjKCT_wrk18,4.28,4.42, supporting material by supporting
XyRjKCT_wrk18,,, material
XyRjKCT_wrk18,,, I mean PowerPoint Prezi whatever slide
XyRjKCT_wrk18,,, format you intend to use but also video
XyRjKCT_wrk18,,, as well don't ignore video you can still
XyRjKCT_wrk18,,, start an online presentation with an
XyRjKCT_wrk19,4.45,4.58, opening video if you want to and the
XyRjKCT_wrk19,,, slides that you use make sure you use
XyRjKCT_wrk19,,, pictures so that people really remember
XyRjKCT_wrk19,,, them and remember you and your content
XyRjKCT_wrk19,,, and importantly with supporting content
XyRjKCT_wrk19,,, you need to make sure that you have a
XyRjKCT_wrk20,5,5.14, backup as well when things are online
XyRjKCT_wrk20,,, you always run the risk of the stream
XyRjKCT_wrk20,,, going down and people not being able to
XyRjKCT_wrk20,,, see you if this happens have your
XyRjKCT_wrk20,,, supporting content your slides and your
XyRjKCT_wrk20,,, opening video available so that you can
XyRjKCT_wrk21,5.16,5.31, send it to people if they haven't been
XyRjKCT_wrk21,,, able to see it properly online so those
XyRjKCT_wrk21,,, are my five top tips when it comes to
XyRjKCT_wrk21,,, presenting online remember the
XyRjKCT_wrk21,,, audience's expectation is low most of
XyRjKCT_wrk21,,, these are [ __ ] so if you just put in
XyRjKCT_wrk23,5.33,5.48, some extra effort and follow those five
XyRjKCT_wrk23,,, top tips you'll deliver some awesome
XyRjKCT_wrk23,,, content that people will remember thanks

WufMj1xHX301,0,0.1,   What 's up guy ?
WufMj1xHX301,,,  It 's Rowan here from Art of Smart TV .
WufMj1xHX301,,,  And one of the thing that school
WufMj1xHX301,,,  are increasingly doing for English and for other subject
WufMj1xHX301,,,  is they 're doing assessment that
WufMj1xHX301,,,  are delivered by oral presentation .
WufMj1xHX302,0.13,0.24,  So in other word you 've got ta give a speech .
WufMj1xHX302,,,  And the reality is
WufMj1xHX302,,,  if you can speak confidently and effectively
WufMj1xHX302,,,  what you 're gon na find is that
WufMj1xHX302,,,  your mark are gon na be so much higher
WufMj1xHX302,,,  regardless of whether you 've got brilliant content or not .
WufMj1xHX303,0.28,0.41,  Do n't get me wrong content important .
WufMj1xHX303,,,  But your ability to present and communicate powerfully
WufMj1xHX303,,,  through a speech is gon na help you improve your result .
WufMj1xHX303,,,  Not just at school but the reality is
WufMj1xHX303,,,  throughout the rest of your career .
WufMj1xHX303,,,  In fact the ability to present confidently
WufMj1xHX304,0.45,1.01,  are actually result in a pay increase
WufMj1xHX304,,,  on average of just on eight and half thousand dollar
WufMj1xHX304,,,  per year for recent university graduate .
WufMj1xHX304,,,  So you 're not only you 're gon na do better at school
WufMj1xHX304,,,  you 're also gon na do better at your career .
WufMj1xHX304,,,  So what I 'm gon na look at in this video is
WufMj1xHX305,1.03,1.15,  some practical four in fact
WufMj1xHX305,,,  practical strategy that you can use .
WufMj1xHX305,,,  Super simple that will make a huge difference
WufMj1xHX305,,,  in helping you nail your school oral presentation
WufMj1xHX305,,,  and develop your public speaking skill
WufMj1xHX305,,,  for life beyond school .
WufMj1xHX306,1.17,1.33,  ( upbeat music )
WufMj1xHX306,,,  So strategy number one .
WufMj1xHX306,,,  The simple thing that you can do is actually look
WufMj1xHX306,,,  at your stance when you come to deliver a presentation .
WufMj1xHX306,,,  Often what happens is when student stand
WufMj1xHX306,,,  to deliver a presentation the stance is really pole
WufMj1xHX307,1.37,1.48,  and their foot are really close together .
WufMj1xHX307,,,  And what this mean is that you end up wiggling and
WufMj1xHX307,,,  you know all of these like nervous gesture
WufMj1xHX307,,,  and these look horrible .
WufMj1xHX307,,,  That can be incredibly distracting .
WufMj1xHX307,,,  In fact you 've probably seen someone deliver a speech
WufMj1xHX308,1.5,2.02,  and then just done this little this little dance
WufMj1xHX308,,,  you know throughout the entire presentation
WufMj1xHX308,,,  and all you could look at wa their dance
WufMj1xHX308,,,  and their foot and not the actual presentation .
WufMj1xHX308,,,  So the suggestion here is really really simple .
WufMj1xHX308,,,  I want you to pretend that you 're Wonder Woman .
WufMj1xHX309,2.04,2.13,  I know that sound weird .
WufMj1xHX309,,,  Walk onto the stage
WufMj1xHX309,,,  and get your foot roughly should width apart .
WufMj1xHX309,,,  Really really important
WufMj1xHX309,,,  because it gon na actually root you into the ground
WufMj1xHX309,,,  so you 've got a strong stance .
WufMj1xHX3010,2.14,2.25,  It 's much harder now to move around and wiggle .
WufMj1xHX3010,,,  It 's gon na really help you be able to present effectively .
WufMj1xHX3010,,,  That 's the first thing .
WufMj1xHX3010,,,  When you walk onto that stage
WufMj1xHX3010,,,  to present your speech at school
WufMj1xHX3010,,,  I want you to think about where are my foot
WufMj1xHX3011,2.27,2.36,  and I am Wonder Woman right .
WufMj1xHX3011,,,  Get on there .
WufMj1xHX3011,,,  Stand tall and strong
WufMj1xHX3011,,,  and have your foot shoulder width apart
WufMj1xHX3011,,,  and then start delivering your presentation .
WufMj1xHX3011,,,  So the next strategy that you can use
WufMj1xHX3012,2.38,2.5,  to be a more effective public speaker is pace .
WufMj1xHX3012,,,  So how quickly you 're speaking .
WufMj1xHX3012,,,  So one of the thing I find is that because
WufMj1xHX3012,,,  you 're nervous when you get onto that stage
WufMj1xHX3012,,,  the first thing that you want to do
WufMj1xHX3012,,,  is speak really really really really really quickly
WufMj1xHX3013,2.52,3.03,  and everything 's got ta come at the same time and
WufMj1xHX3013,,,  you might feel you 're speaking slowly
WufMj1xHX3013,,,  but the rest of the room is like whoa
WufMj1xHX3013,,,  what on earth is happening .
WufMj1xHX3013,,,  So you need to be able to slow your pace down
WufMj1xHX3013,,,  and use pause effectively .
WufMj1xHX3014,3.06,3.14,  And there 's a really simple way
WufMj1xHX3014,,,  that you can use pause effectively .
WufMj1xHX3014,,,  I want you to get your speech out
WufMj1xHX3014,,,  and identify what are some key area
WufMj1xHX3014,,,  on the speech that you think
WufMj1xHX3014,,,  pausing and slowing down is gon na be important
WufMj1xHX3015,3.17,3.32,  a a reminder for you .
WufMj1xHX3015,,,  So note what I did there wa a pause of course .
WufMj1xHX3015,,,  But one of the thing that you can do
WufMj1xHX3015,,,  to work at how long you should pause for
WufMj1xHX3015,,,  is to count for three second
WufMj1xHX3015,,,  because often it 's gon na it 's gon na feel like
WufMj1xHX3016,3.35,3.48,  you 're pausing for such a long period of time
WufMj1xHX3016,,,  but the reality is for the rest of the audience
WufMj1xHX3016,,,  in the room gon na go like that .
WufMj1xHX3016,,,  So to help you pause for long enough
WufMj1xHX3016,,,  when you pause I want you to count in your head
WufMj1xHX3016,,,  one two three .
WufMj1xHX3017,3.51,3.59,  Three second and then continue going on .
WufMj1xHX3017,,,  So really simple .
WufMj1xHX3017,,,  You 've got ta get your pacing right
WufMj1xHX3017,,,  when you deliver
WufMj1xHX3017,,,  and one of the thing that you can do
WufMj1xHX3017,,,  is mark out in your speech when you 're gon na pause
WufMj1xHX3018,4.02,4.11,  and then what you 're going to do
WufMj1xHX3018,,,  is you 're going to identify
WufMj1xHX3018,,,  that you 're gon na pause for three second
WufMj1xHX3018,,,  and count to three .
WufMj1xHX3018,,,  So unless you 've got an incredible memory
WufMj1xHX3018,,,  you 're not gon na be delivering your speech
WufMj1xHX3019,4.13,4.24,  without some form of note .
WufMj1xHX3019,,,  Now using note is okay .
WufMj1xHX3019,,,  You can deliver fantastic speech with note .
WufMj1xHX3019,,,  But often what happens in a lot of speech at school
WufMj1xHX3019,,,  is that
WufMj1xHX3019,,,  you know the note become a crutch
WufMj1xHX3020,4.27,4.39,  and so what end up happening is that
WufMj1xHX3020,,,  you know a student you walk out onto the stage
WufMj1xHX3020,,,  and then what will end up happening is you read the note .
WufMj1xHX3020,,,  So this is what need to happen
WufMj1xHX3020,,,  and then what also need to happen is this
WufMj1xHX3020,,,  and then I 'm going to read some more
WufMj1xHX3021,4.4,4.49,  and then I 'm occasionally look up
WufMj1xHX3021,,,  but I 'm going to be mainly reading
WufMj1xHX3021,,,  and then look up every now and then
WufMj1xHX3021,,,  but really I 'm reading .
WufMj1xHX3021,,,  In reality that 's not a great use of note .
WufMj1xHX3021,,,  That 's not a great use of note
WufMj1xHX3022,4.5,4.58,  because what you 're really doing
WufMj1xHX3022,,,  is reading
WufMj1xHX3022,,,  and getting lost in what you 're reading
WufMj1xHX3022,,,  and not maintaining eye contact
WufMj1xHX3022,,,  with the audience around you .
WufMj1xHX3022,,,  So a really simple thing that you can do
WufMj1xHX3023,5,5.09,  and when you 're using note
WufMj1xHX3023,,,  is that you wan na use them a a way to
WufMj1xHX3023,,,  to let you know what you need
WufMj1xHX3023,,,  but then to be able to come back and
WufMj1xHX3023,,,  make eye contact with the audience .
WufMj1xHX3023,,,  So the suggestion I have is
WufMj1xHX3024,5.11,5.2,  with your speech note
WufMj1xHX3024,,,  I want you to go through them .
WufMj1xHX3024,,,  I want you to pick up a pen
WufMj1xHX3024,,,  and at every point you think it 's gon na be really important
WufMj1xHX3024,,,  to look at the audience to build eye contact
WufMj1xHX3024,,,  I want you to make a little mark .
WufMj1xHX3025,5.22,5.3,  A little mark so that if you are reading your note
WufMj1xHX3025,,,  and you see that little dot appear
WufMj1xHX3025,,,  it 's a reminder to you to go
WufMj1xHX3025,,,  I better look up and make some eye contact
WufMj1xHX3025,,,  with the audience .
WufMj1xHX3025,,,  So put these mark throughout your entire speech .
WufMj1xHX3026,5.33,5.46,  It 'll make it really easy for you to look up
WufMj1xHX3026,,,  and then continue to go back to find where you were at .
WufMj1xHX3026,,,  It will help you build more eye contact
WufMj1xHX3026,,,  when you 're delivering your presentation using note .
WufMj1xHX3026,,,  Instead of just having head stuck in
WufMj1xHX3026,,,  and not actually building any repertoire or connection
WufMj1xHX3027,5.49,5.59,  with your audience .
WufMj1xHX3027,,,  So the final point
WufMj1xHX3027,,,  is that most of the time when people deliver speech
WufMj1xHX3027,,,  they speak really quietly
WufMj1xHX3027,,,  and no one can hear them .
WufMj1xHX3027,,,  Right so vocal projection really really important .
WufMj1xHX3028,6.02,6.13,  So you need to make sure that people at the back of the room
WufMj1xHX3028,,,  can still hear you .
WufMj1xHX3028,,,  So the way that you do this
WufMj1xHX3028,,,  is you 've actually got to over compensate
WufMj1xHX3028,,,  because you 're gon na think
WufMj1xHX3028,,,  you 're speaking really really loud
WufMj1xHX3029,6.15,6.22,  and I promise you you 're not .
WufMj1xHX3029,,,  Now what 's gon na be happening
WufMj1xHX3029,,,  is the nerve gon na get to you
WufMj1xHX3029,,,  and you 're actually gon na
WufMj1xHX3029,,,  be speaking quieter than you think .
WufMj1xHX3029,,,  So one of the way that you can do this
WufMj1xHX3030,6.23,6.33,  before going out to deliver a speech
WufMj1xHX3030,,,  is actually go to the toilet
WufMj1xHX3030,,,  go to like the back oval somewhere at school
WufMj1xHX3030,,,  and I want you to just shout .
WufMj1xHX3030,,,  The whole point of this is to just
WufMj1xHX3030,,,  go crazy and go extreme for a moment
WufMj1xHX3031,6.35,6.47,  stretch the comfort zone
WufMj1xHX3031,,,  because then when you come back in to deliver your speech
WufMj1xHX3031,,,  you 're gon na find that your volume
WufMj1xHX3031,,,  actually naturally ha got a little bit louder
WufMj1xHX3031,,,  because that 's what you were just doing before
WufMj1xHX3031,,,  and you know you 're sort of borrowing some of that
WufMj1xHX3032,6.49,6.59,  and bringing it into your space .
WufMj1xHX3032,,,  Its a really great way to really trick yourself
WufMj1xHX3032,,,  into speaking more loudly
WufMj1xHX3032,,,  in your presentation
WufMj1xHX3032,,,  and having better vocal projection .
WufMj1xHX3032,,,  So what I 've given you today guy
WufMj1xHX3033,7.02,7.14,  is four strategy that you can use
WufMj1xHX3033,,,  to significantly improve your ability
WufMj1xHX3033,,,  to deliver amazing oral presentation .
WufMj1xHX3033,,,  We 've looked at stance and the Wonder Woman pose .
WufMj1xHX3033,,,  We 've looked at pacing and the ability
WufMj1xHX3033,,,  to slow down what you 're saying .
WufMj1xHX3034,7.17,7.28,  We 've looked at vocal projection
WufMj1xHX3034,,,  and we 've looked at eye contact and use of note .
WufMj1xHX3034,,,  You can nail these four strategy
WufMj1xHX3034,,,  your ability to present confidently
WufMj1xHX3034,,,  is going to improve dramatically .
WufMj1xHX3034,,,  You 're going to get better result at school
WufMj1xHX3035,7.29,7.39,  in your oral presentation .
WufMj1xHX3035,,,  But you 're also gon na be laying
WufMj1xHX3035,,,  a really strong foundation for life beyond school .

Rua5eBaX4gw2,,,  going beyond bullet and focusing on
Rua5eBaX4gw2,,,  influence
Rua5eBaX4gw3,0.26,0.35,  we strongly believe that today a normal
Rua5eBaX4gw3,,,  boring
Rua5eBaX4gw3,,,  powerpoint presentation with 
Rua5eBaX4gw3,,,  bullet point on it i 'm not it 's
Rua5eBaX4gw3,,,  definitely not going to be enough for
Rua5eBaX4gw3,,,  you to score client
Rua5eBaX4gw4,0.37,0.47,  for you to close business deal for you
Rua5eBaX4gw4,,,  to get more sale
Rua5eBaX4gw4,,,  it 's just not enough if you want to know
Rua5eBaX4gw4,,,  if this course is really really
Rua5eBaX4gw4,,,  something that you need
Rua5eBaX4gw4,,,  i want you to ask yourself these
Rua5eBaX4gw5,0.49,0.58,  question okay
Rua5eBaX4gw5,,,  are you conducting or taking business
Rua5eBaX4gw5,,,  call over the phone right now
Rua5eBaX4gw5,,,  just say yes or no okay are you pitching
Rua5eBaX4gw5,,,  your product
Rua5eBaX4gw5,,,  or service or your service offering on
Rua5eBaX4gw6,1,1.11,  zoom or google meet or
Rua5eBaX4gw6,,,  any online portal right or window or
Rua5eBaX4gw6,,,  microsoft team whatever it is are you
Rua5eBaX4gw6,,,  pitching your product or service
Rua5eBaX4gw6,,,  online do you think you sound dull or
Rua5eBaX4gw6,,,  boring when you speak
Rua5eBaX4gw7,1.12,1.21,  if that 's a yes consider doing this
Rua5eBaX4gw7,,,  course
Rua5eBaX4gw7,,,  if any of these three question are yes
Rua5eBaX4gw7,,,  consider doing the course right
Rua5eBaX4gw7,,,  do you feel like people do n't quite
Rua5eBaX4gw7,,,  understand you when you speak
Rua5eBaX4gw8,1.23,1.33,  if it 's a yes consider doing the course
Rua5eBaX4gw8,,,  do you feel like your message always
Rua5eBaX4gw8,,,  lack clarity
Rua5eBaX4gw8,,,  again if it 's a yes you should consider
Rua5eBaX4gw8,,,  doing this course
Rua5eBaX4gw8,,,  most importantly are you doing well in
Rua5eBaX4gw9,1.35,1.43,  interview
Rua5eBaX4gw9,,,  and here 's where the answer change if
Rua5eBaX4gw9,,,  it 's a no
Rua5eBaX4gw9,,,  you should consider doing this course
Rua5eBaX4gw9,,,  let me tell you why
Rua5eBaX4gw9,,,  there are a few thing that you need to
Rua5eBaX4gw10,1.45,1.53,  know right now pitching is happening
Rua5eBaX4gw10,,,  online
Rua5eBaX4gw10,,,  and it 's going to be this way in the
Rua5eBaX4gw10,,,  foreseeable future
Rua5eBaX4gw10,,,  attention span are much much shorter
Rua5eBaX4gw10,,,  that mean visuals and crisp
Rua5eBaX4gw11,1.55,2.06,  presentation are of the essence deal
Rua5eBaX4gw11,,,  are getting closed on phone call
Rua5eBaX4gw11,,,  interview are happening on phone call
Rua5eBaX4gw11,,,  sale are getting closed on phone call
Rua5eBaX4gw11,,,  okay
Rua5eBaX4gw11,,,  so that mean your voice is the only
Rua5eBaX4gw12,2.08,2.16,  tool you have in your pocket
Rua5eBaX4gw12,,,  are you using it correctly most likely
Rua5eBaX4gw12,,,  that
Rua5eBaX4gw12,,,  the answer to this question is going to
Rua5eBaX4gw12,,,  be no because people do n't understand
Rua5eBaX4gw12,,,  the power of voice modulation
Rua5eBaX4gw13,2.18,2.3,  something that we are going to be
Rua5eBaX4gw13,,,  covering in depth and in detail
Rua5eBaX4gw13,,,  during this course audience engagement
Rua5eBaX4gw13,,,  and speaker charisma
Rua5eBaX4gw13,,,  is everything like literally everything
Rua5eBaX4gw13,,,  if you ca n't keep your audience engaged
Rua5eBaX4gw14,2.32,2.41,  if you ca n't keep them hooked and if you
Rua5eBaX4gw14,,,  ca n't keep them
Rua5eBaX4gw14,,,  interested you might a well just not
Rua5eBaX4gw14,,,  speak
Rua5eBaX4gw14,,,  and that 's why these three thing
Rua5eBaX4gw14,,,  right now is something you should be
Rua5eBaX4gw15,2.44,2.53,  acing you should be async pitching
Rua5eBaX4gw15,,,  online or doing great virtual
Rua5eBaX4gw15,,,  presentation
Rua5eBaX4gw15,,,  you should be doing great call if it 's
Rua5eBaX4gw15,,,  a tele call it 's a sale call it 's a
Rua5eBaX4gw15,,,  business development call whatever it is
Rua5eBaX4gw16,2.55,3.04,  you need to start acing them
Rua5eBaX4gw16,,,  and if you are someone who doe n't have
Rua5eBaX4gw16,,,  charisma
Rua5eBaX4gw16,,,  or who doe n't have the ability to keep
Rua5eBaX4gw16,,,  your audience engaged
Rua5eBaX4gw16,,,  consider doing this course okay
Rua5eBaX4gw17,3.07,3.17,  this is what we plan to teach you our
Rua5eBaX4gw17,,,  entire module is focused on just three
Rua5eBaX4gw17,,,  important word
Rua5eBaX4gw17,,,  the first one is engage right and we
Rua5eBaX4gw17,,,  just spoke about it
Rua5eBaX4gw17,,,  so you will learn to engage with your
Rua5eBaX4gw18,3.19,3.28,  audience because let 's face it
Rua5eBaX4gw18,,,  no one like one communication it 's
Rua5eBaX4gw18,,,  dull
Rua5eBaX4gw18,,,  it 's drab and it 's a complete waste of
Rua5eBaX4gw18,,,  time you will also learn how to
Rua5eBaX4gw18,,,  excite your audience you will learn
Rua5eBaX4gw19,3.31,3.42,  technique and method to excite your
Rua5eBaX4gw19,,,  audience or your learner
Rua5eBaX4gw19,,,  because this excitement is what 's going
Rua5eBaX4gw19,,,  to ultimately lead to the third step
Rua5eBaX4gw19,,,  and the third step the third pillar of
Rua5eBaX4gw19,,,  this module
Rua5eBaX4gw20,3.43,3.54,  is empower right what is empower
Rua5eBaX4gw20,,,  you will learn to empower and empowering
Rua5eBaX4gw20,,,  mean leaving
Rua5eBaX4gw20,,,  every presentation with a cta which is a
Rua5eBaX4gw20,,,  call to action
Rua5eBaX4gw20,,,  that mean you should want to make your
Rua5eBaX4gw21,3.56,4.04,  learner want
Rua5eBaX4gw21,,,  to take action every time you 're done
Rua5eBaX4gw21,,,  with a presentation if it 's a sale
Rua5eBaX4gw21,,,  presentation
Rua5eBaX4gw21,,,  they should want to buy a product if
Rua5eBaX4gw21,,,  it 's a service presentation where you 're
Rua5eBaX4gw22,4.06,4.15,  pitching a service
Rua5eBaX4gw22,,,  they should want to subscribe to your
Rua5eBaX4gw22,,,  service if it 's a
Rua5eBaX4gw22,,,  presentation at college people should
Rua5eBaX4gw22,,,  want your professor should want to give
Rua5eBaX4gw22,,,  you full mark right
Rua5eBaX4gw23,4.17,4.25,  the goal should be that you should make
Rua5eBaX4gw23,,,  people want to do something
Rua5eBaX4gw23,,,  it could be empowering them to take
Rua5eBaX4gw23,,,  action
Rua5eBaX4gw23,,,  and go and change their life it could
Rua5eBaX4gw23,,,  be empowering them to
Rua5eBaX4gw24,4.26,4.38,  subscribe to your service it could be
Rua5eBaX4gw24,,,  empowering them to buy a product

Rua5eBaX4gw24,,,  this is what we plan to teach you engage
Rua5eBaX4gw24,,,  excite and empower so what are you
Rua5eBaX4gw24,,,  waiting for
Rua5eBaX4gw25,4.39,4.49,  sign up for the course start learning
Rua5eBaX4gw25,,,  start getting better at giving
Rua5eBaX4gw25,,,  really good effective presentation what
Rua5eBaX4gw25,,,  you absolutely need to know is that this
Rua5eBaX4gw25,,,  is not just
Rua5eBaX4gw25,,,  going to be video we want holistic
Rua5eBaX4gw26,4.52,5.01,  development and so we 're going to have
Rua5eBaX4gw26,,,  assessment after each section
Rua5eBaX4gw26,,,  we 're also going to be giving you a lot
Rua5eBaX4gw26,,,  of learning material so that you can go
Rua5eBaX4gw26,,,  back to this learning material
Rua5eBaX4gw26,,,  and refer to it throughout we 're going
Rua5eBaX4gw27,5.03,5.12,  to be giving you ton and ton of
Rua5eBaX4gw27,,,  example so it 's going to be
Rua5eBaX4gw27,,,  very very experiential in in nature you
Rua5eBaX4gw27,,,  will be able to relate to everything
Rua5eBaX4gw27,,,  that we 're seeing
Rua5eBaX4gw27,,,  and that 's going to help you remember
Rua5eBaX4gw29,5.14,5.41,  every concept that you learn
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  you 've probably heard this line that the
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  best investment
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  that you make is the investment in
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  yourself so stop thinking and start
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  investing start the course get better
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  be better perform better right if you
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  want professional success
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  start now
Rua5eBaX4gw29,,,  you
cj5aSWeJFj41,0.06,0.19,  here 's a little tip sometimes it help
cj5aSWeJFj41,,,  if thing go wrong because then your
cj5aSWeJFj41,,,  audience warms up to you when they see
cj5aSWeJFj41,,,  how you manage it because we see you
cj5aSWeJFj41,,,  when you 're under pressure how you react
cj5aSWeJFj41,,,  that 's closer to the real deal
cj5aSWeJFj42,0.24,0.42,  first thing to look more confident is
cj5aSWeJFj42,,,  believe in yourself but that do n't
cj5aSWeJFj42,,,  student that day another technique to
cj5aSWeJFj42,,,  look more confident when you 're speaking
cj5aSWeJFj42,,,  is to breathe sound silly but you need
cj5aSWeJFj42,,,  to turn it and bring on the life not
cj5aSWeJFj43,0.43,0.57,  tell me to breathe but here 's something
cj5aSWeJFj43,,,  to keep in mind
cj5aSWeJFj43,,,  number one when we get nervous we tense
cj5aSWeJFj43,,,  up and we tend to hold our breath it 's a
cj5aSWeJFj43,,,  normal reaction we hear noise hear you
cj5aSWeJFj43,,,  breathe we do the same thing up there on
cj5aSWeJFj44,1,1.14,  stage how many get nervous so remember
cj5aSWeJFj44,,,  to remind celebrate and the second thing
cj5aSWeJFj44,,,  is to read member or house that we read
cj5aSWeJFj44,,,  correctly do we have any singer in the
cj5aSWeJFj44,,,  room
cj5aSWeJFj44,,,  okay so tell me the belly breath you get
cj5aSWeJFj45,1.17,1.3,  really really teeny crack that the
cj5aSWeJFj45,,,  correct way to breathe this from the
cj5aSWeJFj45,,,  bottom of your diaphragm which is behind
cj5aSWeJFj45,,,  your belly and if you 're breathing
cj5aSWeJFj45,,,  correctly there 's not a test result just
cj5aSWeJFj45,,,  try it right now put your hand on your
cj5aSWeJFj46,1.32,1.46,  waist like this and then breathe it and
cj5aSWeJFj46,,,  if you do it incorrectly you should be
cj5aSWeJFj46,,,  pushing out so they will not the tire
cj5aSWeJFj46,,,  wait a minute yourself now
cj5aSWeJFj46,,,  bring the air when you suck the air all
cj5aSWeJFj46,,,  the way down hold it for a few second
cj5aSWeJFj47,1.49,2.07,  and then let it out slowly and when you
cj5aSWeJFj47,,,  let it over
cj5aSWeJFj47,,,  that 's the correct way degree problem is
cj5aSWeJFj47,,,  we get busy and you watch a baby see
cj5aSWeJFj47,,,  we 're born with the ability to breathe
cj5aSWeJFj47,,,  correctly but we learn we learn math
cj5aSWeJFj48,2.1,2.43,  you watch your baby if a baby 's the time
cj5aSWeJFj48,,,  if you breathe correctly every one of
cj5aSWeJFj48,,,  you breathe correctly to calm yourself
cj5aSWeJFj48,,,  down you prevent the flutter in your
cj5aSWeJFj48,,,  head in your brain because sometimes
cj5aSWeJFj48,,,  that flutter is a lack of oxygen it 's
cj5aSWeJFj49,2.46,2.57,  not enough oxygen
cj5aSWeJFj49,,,  redirecting advantage enough number to
cj5aSWeJFj49,,,  breathe correctly you can project your
cj5aSWeJFj49,,,  voice how loud your eye got nothing to
cj5aSWeJFj49,,,  do how small or how big you are remember
cj5aSWeJFj49,,,  the baby it 's about how much area and
cj5aSWeJFj411,3,3.24,  the third thing is if you breathe
cj5aSWeJFj411,,,  correctly
cj5aSWeJFj411,,,  then you will be able to pause when you
cj5aSWeJFj411,,,  want to the next time you go to speak
cj5aSWeJFj411,,,  before you get up the speech you do n't
cj5aSWeJFj411,,,  check yourself remind yourself take a
cj5aSWeJFj411,,,  couple deep breath because it might be
cj5aSWeJFj411,,,  the last one you take for a while

0EI3rSYARpQ11,,,  either upfront or after engagement to
0EI3rSYARpQ11,,,  their senior leader and their board and
0EI3rSYARpQ11,,,  lately it 's been a lot about
0EI3rSYARpQ12,2.32,2.48,  cybersecurity and an integration with
0EI3rSYARpQ12,,,  business continuity plan or actually
0EI3rSYARpQ12,,,  actionable result and you yourselves
0EI3rSYARpQ12,,,  have probably been in presentation and
0EI3rSYARpQ12,,,  felt like what 's actually on this image
0EI3rSYARpQ12,,,  and presenting itself standing up in
0EI3rSYARpQ13,2.52,3.07,  front of an audience so if we look at
0EI3rSYARpQ13,,,  the top 10 it 's it 's right there at
0EI3rSYARpQ13,,,  number 2 so understandable
0EI3rSYARpQ13,,,  now take that fear of public speaking
0EI3rSYARpQ13,,,  and put it in front of your bos or your
0EI3rSYARpQ13,,,  bos 's bos and it get a little
0EI3rSYARpQ14,3.09,3.22,  stressful
0EI3rSYARpQ14,,,  so I want to make a point during this
0EI3rSYARpQ14,,,  presentation I 'm actually going to play
0EI3rSYARpQ14,,,  two different role my first role a I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ14,,,  doing now is a the presenter I will
0EI3rSYARpQ14,,,  step aside in a dual personality world
0EI3rSYARpQ15,3.24,3.37,  and talk about the presentation itself
0EI3rSYARpQ15,,,  so I 'm going to be playing that
0EI3rSYARpQ15,,,  balancing act a we go so will you
0EI3rSYARpQ15,,,  normally see it a good presentation is
0EI3rSYARpQ15,,,  usually there 's a start and I love this
0EI3rSYARpQ15,,,  one especially why if you in an audience
0EI3rSYARpQ16,3.42,3.56,  and your are doing a present or watching
0EI3rSYARpQ16,,,  a presentation look around how fast the
0EI3rSYARpQ16,,,  people pick up the phone with open the
0EI3rSYARpQ16,,,  laptop you 've got 30 second that impact
0EI3rSYARpQ16,,,  of what you 're going to do have to have
0EI3rSYARpQ16,,,  a captured audience attention otherwise
0EI3rSYARpQ17,3.59,4.15,  it becomes a lot more difficult so in
0EI3rSYARpQ17,,,  doing it and building that it relates to
0EI3rSYARpQ17,,,  the human brain or one side of the brain
0EI3rSYARpQ17,,,  is our feeling right it 's that
0EI3rSYARpQ17,,,  creativity to the thinking side but on
0EI3rSYARpQ17,,,  the other side it 's the analytical side
0EI3rSYARpQ18,4.17,4.32,  and if we 're going to do an effective
0EI3rSYARpQ18,,,  presentation it 's got to cover both
0EI3rSYARpQ18,,,  side of that and that presentation the
0EI3rSYARpQ18,,,  best way to get it across is to tell u
0EI3rSYARpQ18,,,  and that 's exactly what we 're going to
0EI3rSYARpQ18,,,  do so let 's take a look we 're doing
0EI3rSYARpQ19,4.36,4.51,  we 're gon na find out understand who our
0EI3rSYARpQ19,,,  audience is why they 're there go through
0EI3rSYARpQ19,,,  that process what 's the message what 's
0EI3rSYARpQ19,,,  the takeaway we 're going to give them
0EI3rSYARpQ19,,,  and how do we build that story for them
0EI3rSYARpQ19,,,  talk about some of the delivery tip and
0EI3rSYARpQ20,4.54,5.08,  making sure that we 're successful and
0EI3rSYARpQ20,,,  that your presentation is heard and they
0EI3rSYARpQ20,,,  leave with it
0EI3rSYARpQ20,,,  I even that reference I 'll cover them
0EI3rSYARpQ20,,,  a well so let 's start with our audience
0EI3rSYARpQ20,,,  I call it the four value who are they
0EI3rSYARpQ21,5.13,5.26,  who 's sitting there who 's who 's sitting
0EI3rSYARpQ21,,,  in the hi audience now will they know
0EI3rSYARpQ21,,,  about the subject that I 'm going to be
0EI3rSYARpQ21,,,  speaking on whether that be in an indie
0EI3rSYARpQ21,,,  industry conference or my board I really
0EI3rSYARpQ21,,,  want to get in good sense because I 've
0EI3rSYARpQ22,5.28,5.45,  got to build that story and content to
0EI3rSYARpQ22,,,  them think why are they there again it
0EI3rSYARpQ22,,,  sit there because you 've been required
0EI3rSYARpQ22,,,  to show up or you have finding what 's
0EI3rSYARpQ22,,,  that core and more importantly what do
0EI3rSYARpQ22,,,  we want them to lead with it you go to a
0EI3rSYARpQ23,5.48,6.04,  presentation what it is about learning
0EI3rSYARpQ23,,,  one is it an aha moment is n't it ask
0EI3rSYARpQ23,,,  usually board and senior leadership I
0EI3rSYARpQ23,,,  find it 's an ask I need money to fund
0EI3rSYARpQ23,,,  this or mitigate these risk so let 's
0EI3rSYARpQ23,,,  take the valve into the two key
0EI3rSYARpQ24,6.06,6.24,  audience that we 're going to be looking
0EI3rSYARpQ24,,,  at first one is the board amount I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ24,,,  gon na step back what you 'll notice is my
0EI3rSYARpQ24,,,  background I use a lot of imagery I make
0EI3rSYARpQ24,,,  it strong it support exactly what I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ24,,,  going to be talking about but it doe n't
0EI3rSYARpQ25,6.27,6.42,  over shadow it 's about the content so
0EI3rSYARpQ25,,,  I 'm using complimentary ms/ms imagery a
0EI3rSYARpQ25,,,  I go through this sometimes to make a
0EI3rSYARpQ25,,,  point or otherwise support it back to
0EI3rSYARpQ25,,,  our regular schedule
0EI3rSYARpQ25,,,  so who are they your board come from
0EI3rSYARpQ26,6.46,7.02,  all over and the larger your
0EI3rSYARpQ26,,,  organization
0EI3rSYARpQ26,,,  the bigger the people they 're going to
0EI3rSYARpQ26,,,  be teeth information security CEOs of
0EI3rSYARpQ26,,,  both current and retired for position
0EI3rSYARpQ26,,,  let 's make some assumption one thing
0EI3rSYARpQ27,7.04,7.16,  though they 're going to have a very
0EI3rSYARpQ27,,,  little knowledge of business continuity
0EI3rSYARpQ27,,,  I 've got to make that assumption and
0EI3rSYARpQ27,,,  we 'll talk through that a well if
0EI3rSYARpQ27,,,  that 's not their key even from a CIO it
0EI3rSYARpQ27,,,  is a former CI oh you do n't have that
0EI3rSYARpQ28,7.19,7.35,  desk and honestly this you 're a stranger
0EI3rSYARpQ28,,,  you 're coming in usually through senior
0EI3rSYARpQ28,,,  leadership they probably do n't know you
0EI3rSYARpQ28,,,  especially if it 's your first
0EI3rSYARpQ28,,,  presentation and this is a real
0EI3rSYARpQ28,,,  important so I 'm going to talk about
0EI3rSYARpQ29,7.36,7.5,  this they have a sanitized view a a
0EI3rSYARpQ29,,,  former senior leader what our board knew
0EI3rSYARpQ29,,,  about our organization is what we
0EI3rSYARpQ29,,,  present it to them
0EI3rSYARpQ29,,,  so when you 're doing in developing a
0EI3rSYARpQ29,,,  presentation it 's probably going to go
0EI3rSYARpQ30,7.52,8.1,  through about four to five hundred
0EI3rSYARpQ30,,,  iteration because everybody want to
0EI3rSYARpQ30,,,  make sure that that message is clean and
0EI3rSYARpQ30,,,  correct again now it 's the senior
0EI3rSYARpQ30,,,  leadership notice the image image show
0EI3rSYARpQ30,,,  that support what I presented so right
0EI3rSYARpQ31,8.17,8.31,  obviously Captain Obvious is the
0EI3rSYARpQ31,,,  currency 's fo io Sol alphabet soup but
0EI3rSYARpQ31,,,  again there are those are the people
0EI3rSYARpQ31,,,  that are going to be sitting in that
0EI3rSYARpQ31,,,  boardroom that we 're going to be talking
0EI3rSYARpQ31,,,  to I 'm going to make some assumption
0EI3rSYARpQ32,8.33,8.44,  that they have some passing note
0EI3rSYARpQ32,,,  whether you 've got it predecessor or
0EI3rSYARpQ32,,,  previous organization or a they 've
0EI3rSYARpQ32,,,  grown through a organization the chance
0EI3rSYARpQ32,,,  are they know that there 's thing such
0EI3rSYARpQ32,,,  a plan and disaster recovery so
0EI3rSYARpQ33,8.47,8.56,  they 're on the passing knowledge and the
0EI3rSYARpQ33,,,  nice thing is hey they may even know you
0EI3rSYARpQ33,,,  spending it at your bos your bos 's
0EI3rSYARpQ33,,,  bos at your bos 's bos 's bos they
0EI3rSYARpQ33,,,  mean
0EI3rSYARpQ33,,,  having a relationship or a knowledge of
0EI3rSYARpQ34,9,9.15,  that person will help and honestly they
0EI3rSYARpQ34,,,  have a very or more realistic view than
0EI3rSYARpQ34,,,  the board because again a thing go up
0EI3rSYARpQ34,,,  they do get filtered and that really is
0EI3rSYARpQ34,,,  important to the perspective that we 're
0EI3rSYARpQ34,,,  going to have is that so when we look at
0EI3rSYARpQ35,9.17,9.32,  perspective let 's look at it from a
0EI3rSYARpQ35,,,  board view hmm business continuity what
0EI3rSYARpQ35,,,  they know is probably from an internal
0EI3rSYARpQ35,,,  or an external audit of a company that
0EI3rSYARpQ35,,,  they 've dealt with the report of
0EI3rSYARpQ35,,,  finding that come up that 's going to be
0EI3rSYARpQ36,9.35,9.52,  their knowledge or if somebody like you
0EI3rSYARpQ36,,,  were or I have student front of them in
0EI3rSYARpQ36,,,  their own organization and dowsing this
0EI3rSYARpQ36,,,  is big this is it current news in the
0EI3rSYARpQ36,,,  new this is how are we reacting so
0EI3rSYARpQ36,,,  they 're going to take that to senior
0EI3rSYARpQ37,9.54,10.06,  leader and so so how are you and I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ37,,,  going to be  fall out or how are we
0EI3rSYARpQ37,,,  handling what the data breach that is
0EI3rSYARpQ37,,,  that if that 's that occur what is our
0EI3rSYARpQ37,,,  stance and what are you doing to fix it
0EI3rSYARpQ37,,,  so that drive a lot of the board down
0EI3rSYARpQ38,10.09,10.25,  to senior leadership and then down to u
0EI3rSYARpQ38,,,  hey their own staff may have have been
0EI3rSYARpQ38,,,  involved in a presentation internally a
0EI3rSYARpQ38,,,  them at senior leader so we really want
0EI3rSYARpQ38,,,  to know okay I 've got this much
0EI3rSYARpQ38,,,  knowledge again passing our senior
0EI3rSYARpQ39,10.29,10.41,  leader Oh a little different again
0EI3rSYARpQ39,,,  notice very similar the board procedure
0EI3rSYARpQ39,,,  see new leader may be board member
0EI3rSYARpQ39,,,  elsewhere
0EI3rSYARpQ39,,,  it 's their internal finding there are
0EI3rSYARpQ39,,,  chief risk officer coming and saying
0EI3rSYARpQ40,10.43,11,  hey we 've got to mitigate these issue
0EI3rSYARpQ40,,,  usually come from top board as
0EI3rSYARpQ40,,,  and senior leader senior leader ask
0EI3rSYARpQ40,,,  those director a president and if all
0EI3rSYARpQ40,,,  of them and that 's where becoming I love
0EI3rSYARpQ40,,,  this one I have to tell you that in a
0EI3rSYARpQ41,11.02,11.13,  guy little story here view
0EI3rSYARpQ41,,,  self this is probably where
0EI3rSYARpQ41,,,  you 'll see the most success
0EI3rSYARpQ41,,,  [ Music ]
0EI3rSYARpQ41,,,  in an organization your organization is
0EI3rSYARpQ41,,,  we know there 's an issue we want to fix
0EI3rSYARpQ42,11.16,11.32,  this what do we need to do it really
0EI3rSYARpQ42,,,  resounds it start the top
0EI3rSYARpQ42,,,  that 's like goverce that so effective
0EI3rSYARpQ42,,,  in business continuity success is that
0EI3rSYARpQ42,,,  that board ha that aura senior leader
0EI3rSYARpQ42,,,  ha that self
0EI3rSYARpQ43,11.34,11.51,  Matt let 's take the positive and just
0EI3rSYARpQ43,,,  put some caveat out there any question
0EI3rSYARpQ43,,,  are usually going to be politically
0EI3rSYARpQ43,,,  motivated and when they explain why or
0EI3rSYARpQ43,,,  how having been through receiving it
0EI3rSYARpQ43,,,  into those question
0EI3rSYARpQ44,11.52,12.1,  so first I 'm a smartest guy in the room
0EI3rSYARpQ44,,,  I need to ask this question a I already
0EI3rSYARpQ44,,,  know the answer but remember we 're the
0EI3rSYARpQ44,,,  subject matter expert when that happens
0EI3rSYARpQ44,,,  we have a board level I will look to the
0EI3rSYARpQ44,,,  senior leader we probably revert
0EI3rSYARpQ45,12.12,12.25,  rehearse this so I 've already covered
0EI3rSYARpQ45,,,  this a an outside consultant it 's a lot
0EI3rSYARpQ45,,,  easier you can nobody tell me to lead so
0EI3rSYARpQ45,,,  here 's the big one not only am i smarter
0EI3rSYARpQ45,,,  than you meeting them in the audience
0EI3rSYARpQ45,,,  back and forth is there usually is
0EI3rSYARpQ46,12.28,12.41,  posturing that somebody that person
0EI3rSYARpQ46,,,  want to be the next CEO and so when the
0EI3rSYARpQ46,,,  board doe their nomination that come
0EI3rSYARpQ46,,,  around a hey this guy is really really
0EI3rSYARpQ46,,,  smart or the scout really really smart
0EI3rSYARpQ46,,,  we should make them antsy so how do I
0EI3rSYARpQ47,12.46,13.01,  fix it normally at this point I would
0EI3rSYARpQ47,,,  have played the video but video audio
0EI3rSYARpQ47,,,  sound doe not play well so I 've
0EI3rSYARpQ47,,,  actually you can have this deck my
0EI3rSYARpQ47,,,  email at the end of this book the link
0EI3rSYARpQ47,,,  in there is also at the bottom this is a
0EI3rSYARpQ48,13.03,13.18,  two minute and 40 second ideo remember
0EI3rSYARpQ48,,,  I said start in tactful have that
0EI3rSYARpQ48,,,  imagery I 'm using video this video is
0EI3rSYARpQ48,,,  about an identical twin that an elevator
0EI3rSYARpQ48,,,  once prepared and one not and it cover
0EI3rSYARpQ48,,,  all aspect of why you need a plan how
0EI3rSYARpQ49,13.21,13.32,  to prepare for disaster
0EI3rSYARpQ49,,,  what you should be doing in disaster
0EI3rSYARpQ49,,,  and the imagery and the background
0EI3rSYARpQ49,,,  change but what it doe is this is
0EI3rSYARpQ49,,,  replicates the board because those
0EI3rSYARpQ49,,,  people or senior leader may be afraid
0EI3rSYARpQ50,13.35,13.47,  to ask question because they do n't want
0EI3rSYARpQ50,,,  to look stupid to their peer it also
0EI3rSYARpQ50,,,  set a baseline remember we do n't know
0EI3rSYARpQ50,,,  what they do n't know this kind of raise
0EI3rSYARpQ50,,,  it up
0EI3rSYARpQ50,,,  I also recommend it 's a great use if
0EI3rSYARpQ51,13.49,14.01,  you 're doing business continuity
0EI3rSYARpQ51,,,  training a part of your life cycle it 's
0EI3rSYARpQ51,,,  a great video I suggest you download it
0EI3rSYARpQ51,,,  because we are a business continuity and
0EI3rSYARpQ51,,,  playing it off the web can be risky
0EI3rSYARpQ51,,,  so I usually embed this in the
0EI3rSYARpQ52,14.03,14.13,  PowerPoint when I do my PowerPoint
0EI3rSYARpQ52,,,  presentation but again very highly
0EI3rSYARpQ52,,,  effective and even ha a Department of
0EI3rSYARpQ52,,,  Homeland Security and it talk
0EI3rSYARpQ52,,,  essentially about active shooter at the
0EI3rSYARpQ52,,,  end and it open the question which is
0EI3rSYARpQ53,14.15,14.34,  a beautiful beautiful introduction to
0EI3rSYARpQ53,,,  your presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ53,,,  so speaking of presentation this is a
0EI3rSYARpQ53,,,  national photo off my phone what 's the
0EI3rSYARpQ53,,,  message what what is my takeaway from
0EI3rSYARpQ53,,,  this line otherwise my eye are bleeding
0EI3rSYARpQ54,14.37,14.51,  what I find is even more ironic if you
0EI3rSYARpQ54,,,  look in the upper right hand corner
0EI3rSYARpQ54,,,  it 's from the marketing communication
0EI3rSYARpQ54,,,  cooking journalism it 's overwhelming if
0EI3rSYARpQ54,,,  you 're going to start or tell that story
0EI3rSYARpQ54,,,  have an impact
0EI3rSYARpQ55,14.53,15.04,  I 'll give you a great example let 's stay
0EI3rSYARpQ55,,,  with cybersecurity
0EI3rSYARpQ55,,,  ransomware it 's a great one ok I 'm going
0EI3rSYARpQ55,,,  to start talking about so when we look
0EI3rSYARpQ55,,,  at threat to our organization and I
0EI3rSYARpQ55,,,  start going through this slide where 's
0EI3rSYARpQ56,15.06,15.23,  your eye are you listening to me
0EI3rSYARpQ56,,,  no you 're trying to figure this slide
0EI3rSYARpQ56,,,  out and it 's not personal it doe n't
0EI3rSYARpQ56,,,  impact you most of the presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ56,,,  that I do I will use very visual and
0EI3rSYARpQ56,,,  strong imagery because it becomes the
0EI3rSYARpQ57,15.26,15.4,  point to tell the story so instead of
0EI3rSYARpQ57,,,  this to talk about it I say ok this ha
0EI3rSYARpQ57,,,  just hit our
0EI3rSYARpQ57,,,  company this is on everybody 's desk top
0EI3rSYARpQ57,,,  right back
0EI3rSYARpQ57,,,  what are we going to do
0EI3rSYARpQ58,15.46,16.02,  pause are great by the way give u a
0EI3rSYARpQ58,,,  chance to capture our thought use the
0EI3rSYARpQ58,,,  emphasis and lead on into the next slide
0EI3rSYARpQ58,,,  so now I can tell my story of what we 're
0EI3rSYARpQ58,,,  going to do and how we 're going to do
0EI3rSYARpQ58,,,  that but this is relatable this is new
0EI3rSYARpQ59,16.04,16.18,  this is current I actually use this for
0EI3rSYARpQ59,,,  our tabletop exercise that we actually
0EI3rSYARpQ59,,,  have an animated oh they see it going
0EI3rSYARpQ59,,,  let 's look at that story let 's talk
0EI3rSYARpQ59,,,  about building the story itself so the
0EI3rSYARpQ59,,,  story where do we start
0EI3rSYARpQ60,16.21,16.34,  it 's hard it 's overwhelming so start
0EI3rSYARpQ60,,,  with an outline whether it be word or
0EI3rSYARpQ60,,,  the PowerPoint outline like way just
0EI3rSYARpQ60,,,  create the outline and then I wa called
0EI3rSYARpQ60,,,  rankbrain and I keep looking at I talk
0EI3rSYARpQ60,,,  and I socialize that outline got it
0EI3rSYARpQ61,16.37,16.51,  okay from there this work really well
0EI3rSYARpQ61,,,  create the title from the slide now that
0EI3rSYARpQ61,,,  I 've got the outline because I 'm a oh I
0EI3rSYARpQ61,,,  miss this one let me go back and put one
0EI3rSYARpQ61,,,  in there creating the title create that
0EI3rSYARpQ61,,,  flow that organic way again I 'm speaking
0EI3rSYARpQ62,16.54,17.06,  and it 's flowing we want the same thing
0EI3rSYARpQ62,,,  I 'm doing that by having the title and
0EI3rSYARpQ62,,,  if you 've noticed I do n't have a lot of
0EI3rSYARpQ62,,,  title sometimes I just have the content
0EI3rSYARpQ62,,,  or the image but again this is exactly
0EI3rSYARpQ62,,,  how you start now they 've got it create
0EI3rSYARpQ63,17.1,17.22,  the or find the image to support it
0EI3rSYARpQ63,,,  look at this title say building a story
0EI3rSYARpQ63,,,  and I 've got a story book open and we 're
0EI3rSYARpQ63,,,  building that story what that 's
0EI3rSYARpQ63,,,  supporting image is exactly what 's
0EI3rSYARpQ63,,,  needed for this slide Matt lean content
0EI3rSYARpQ64,17.28,17.42,  we 'll talk a little bit later on about
0EI3rSYARpQ64,,,  how we knit should be remember press
0EI3rSYARpQ64,,,  it 's more we want to put it in it got
0EI3rSYARpQ64,,,  to support the image and the outline and
0EI3rSYARpQ64,,,  that title so now we 're building up from
0EI3rSYARpQ64,,,  that here we go I need to test it go
0EI3rSYARpQ65,17.48,18,  through that walkthrough
0EI3rSYARpQ65,,,  socialize it internally with your team
0EI3rSYARpQ65,,,  with your bos this point is what you 're
0EI3rSYARpQ65,,,  going to do is always go back and refine
0EI3rSYARpQ65,,,  in all honesty when I do a presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ65,,,  at a conference or for a client
0EI3rSYARpQ66,18.03,18.19,  I 'm usually refining it the day of or
0EI3rSYARpQ66,,,  that morning in fact this presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ66,,,  here pinky an hour of no we were
0EI3rSYARpQ66,,,  changing image because I did n't feel
0EI3rSYARpQ66,,,  that it worked and I wa doing just that
0EI3rSYARpQ66,,,  I wa refining it defining it and then
0EI3rSYARpQ67,18.22,18.39,  delivery let 's take a look at some of
0EI3rSYARpQ67,,,  those delivery of tip that we can
0EI3rSYARpQ67,,,  help make you have that confidence in
0EI3rSYARpQ67,,,  that success in front of data lady
0EI3rSYARpQ67,,,  and see that you immediately laxity you
0EI3rSYARpQ67,,,  look at the image of one right to the
0EI3rSYARpQ68,18.41,18.57,  top because again I want to support that
0EI3rSYARpQ68,,,  so first of all you can probably if you
0EI3rSYARpQ68,,,  were this is live I used to be a chuckle
0EI3rSYARpQ68,,,  you do n't read your supply which I just
0EI3rSYARpQ68,,,  did because people read faster then you
0EI3rSYARpQ68,,,  talk no matter how fast you talk so I
0EI3rSYARpQ69,19.01,19.17,  ca n't focus on two different thing
0EI3rSYARpQ69,,,  if they call it power point too often
0EI3rSYARpQ69,,,  you go to a presentation and it 's not
0EI3rSYARpQ69,,,  even a power read so we do n't want that
0EI3rSYARpQ69,,,  use it a a talking point and that 's
0EI3rSYARpQ69,,,  that refine on the previous slide we
0EI3rSYARpQ70,19.18,19.35,  want to refine it let me get it down so
0EI3rSYARpQ70,,,  the message there with that take away
0EI3rSYARpQ70,,,  this is really really hard to do a
0EI3rSYARpQ70,,,  conference my presentation will say
0EI3rSYARpQ70,,,  here 's the ally I do n't in my
0EI3rSYARpQ70,,,  presentation at an event I 'm six let 's
0EI3rSYARpQ71,19.37,19.55,  fix them up to that point but why why go
0EI3rSYARpQ71,,,  what right if you 're coming to hear this
0EI3rSYARpQ71,,,  content come hear the content
0EI3rSYARpQ71,,,  do n't ever ever use somebody else 's deck
0EI3rSYARpQ71,,,  it 's not your own you need to know those
0EI3rSYARpQ71,,,  material and you need to know them well
0EI3rSYARpQ72,19.57,20.07,  I do n't say memorize them I think that 's
0EI3rSYARpQ72,,,  really hard because it lock you into
0EI3rSYARpQ72,,,  into it and you
0EI3rSYARpQ72,,,  they 're not able to read the audience
0EI3rSYARpQ72,,,  and you might make change my last
0EI3rSYARpQ72,,,  presentation at a secure conference on
0EI3rSYARpQ73,20.11,20.24,  my flight over I wa reading and that
0EI3rSYARpQ73,,,  Facebook 3.1 million people of that I
0EI3rSYARpQ73,,,  did that right into my slide and I
0EI3rSYARpQ73,,,  changed it right under there so what I
0EI3rSYARpQ73,,,  use a mirror right it sound kind of
0EI3rSYARpQ73,,,  funny but until you 're comfortable take
0EI3rSYARpQ74,20.27,20.38,  a look at it
0EI3rSYARpQ74,,,  have somebody friend family record it
0EI3rSYARpQ74,,,  use your phone
0EI3rSYARpQ74,,,  we 're our own worst critic so let 's use
0EI3rSYARpQ74,,,  that where can I refine it watch the
0EI3rSYARpQ74,,,  presentation listen to let me see how I
0EI3rSYARpQ75,20.42,21.1,  am presenting big one here remember
0EI3rSYARpQ75,,,  people read faster than we talk I want
0EI3rSYARpQ75,,,  to talk to the point but not read it so
0EI3rSYARpQ75,,,  now I 'm controlling the audience and how
0EI3rSYARpQ75,,,  we 're going through so this building of
0EI3rSYARpQ75,,,  those slide really meant let me do just
0EI3rSYARpQ76,21.13,21.3,  that so another delivery tip you 've done
0EI3rSYARpQ76,,,  the refinement you 've done the testing
0EI3rSYARpQ76,,,  you know how long it take big point
0EI3rSYARpQ76,,,  here just because you have an hour which
0EI3rSYARpQ76,,,  maybe you do n't but just because you
0EI3rSYARpQ76,,,  have that timeframe do n't do it if
0EI3rSYARpQ77,21.33,21.45,  you 've got a lot of slide you might
0EI3rSYARpQ77,,,  want to speak a little better at a
0EI3rSYARpQ77,,,  faster pace or talk at a normal pace
0EI3rSYARpQ77,,,  because I have enough slide and I know
0EI3rSYARpQ77,,,  the time that it 's going to take to do
0EI3rSYARpQ77,,,  it and I 'm not saying being an
0EI3rSYARpQ78,21.47,22,  auctioneer you 've got too many slide if
0EI3rSYARpQ78,,,  you 're trying to cram them in I did a
0EI3rSYARpQ78,,,  previous presentation on lizard brain
0EI3rSYARpQ78,,,  and that wa almost 60 slide I 'm just
0EI3rSYARpQ78,,,  done in 40 minute at talking at a pace
0EI3rSYARpQ78,,,  like this why because weather or more
0EI3rSYARpQ79,22.03,22.22,  slide were very graphic and they were
0EI3rSYARpQ79,,,  just for a second to explain the topic
0EI3rSYARpQ79,,,  you 've heard me a I 've been presenting
0EI3rSYARpQ79,,,  I speed it up I 've lowered my voice I
0EI3rSYARpQ79,,,  can use pause for emphasis and do that
0EI3rSYARpQ79,,,  you 've seen Ferris Bueller 's Day Off
0EI3rSYARpQ80,22.26,22.46,  that 's the example of what not to do
0EI3rSYARpQ80,,,  their Earth revolves around the Sun
0EI3rSYARpQ80,,,  someone who doe n't moderate their pitch
0EI3rSYARpQ80,,,  and speed I do this it 's a very
0EI3rSYARpQ80,,,  effective technique I follow this craft
0EI3rSYARpQ80,,,  and that presentation very closely in
0EI3rSYARpQ81,22.48,23,  the award he did a presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ81,,,  on why he is the world 's greatest
0EI3rSYARpQ81,,,  speaker and it 's the one with the
0EI3rSYARpQ81,,,  psychological thing opening up the hand
0EI3rSYARpQ81,,,  to your audience show vulnerability and
0EI3rSYARpQ81,,,  build trust so by doing this it really
0EI3rSYARpQ82,23.06,23.25,  engages that what is even further and
0EI3rSYARpQ82,,,  again overdress you are the subject
0EI3rSYARpQ82,,,  matter expert you should come across
0EI3rSYARpQ82,,,  that way now I know this may be a little
0EI3rSYARpQ82,,,  difficult so I 'm going to point it out
0EI3rSYARpQ82,,,  to you it 's a trick I 've used for year
0EI3rSYARpQ83,23.29,23.42,  in doing my slide is how do I
0EI3rSYARpQ83,,,  transition verbal how do I blend
0EI3rSYARpQ83,,,  seamlessly from one slide to the other
0EI3rSYARpQ83,,,  so I do n't know if you can see this or
0EI3rSYARpQ83,,,  not but down in the lower left corner I
0EI3rSYARpQ83,,,  made it even darker than I would
0EI3rSYARpQ84,23.44,24.01,  normally it ha my transition word so
0EI3rSYARpQ84,,,  now I 'll use it coming back laying the
0EI3rSYARpQ84,,,  door up so now that we 've got some good
0EI3rSYARpQ84,,,  delivery tip let 's talk a little bit
0EI3rSYARpQ84,,,  more about making them effective and one
0EI3rSYARpQ84,,,  of the way I like to make thing
0EI3rSYARpQ85,24.02,24.17,  effective again how do you know your
0EI3rSYARpQ85,,,  audience you may not have direct contact
0EI3rSYARpQ85,,,  with is linked it is oh look at them
0EI3rSYARpQ85,,,  because one of the thing that I pointed
0EI3rSYARpQ85,,,  out again it is having that relationship
0EI3rSYARpQ85,,,  of having something to talk about before
0EI3rSYARpQ86,24.21,24.38,  after the presentation really help
0EI3rSYARpQ86,,,  so learning the port hey I just see you
0EI3rSYARpQ86,,,  guy bought heartland security wa
0EI3rSYARpQ86,,,  really neat how 's that going front
0EI3rSYARpQ86,,,  before or afterwards is what it again
0EI3rSYARpQ86,,,  what do we want them to leave with it 's
0EI3rSYARpQ87,24.39,24.55,  the content it 's the message is that ask
0EI3rSYARpQ87,,,  them the story key point here and
0EI3rSYARpQ87,,,  actually a red flag you 're going to
0EI3rSYARpQ87,,,  start late especially a senior leader or
0EI3rSYARpQ87,,,  board and you 're finishing on quote time
0EI3rSYARpQ87,,,  that you were supposed to or maybe early
0EI3rSYARpQ88,24.57,25.08,  because they 're now running behind I wa
0EI3rSYARpQ88,,,  out in Carlsbad California at a board in
0EI3rSYARpQ88,,,  the boardroom to do a presentation that
0EI3rSYARpQ88,,,  started at eight o'clock and I went on a
0EI3rSYARpQ88,,,  date o'clock I wa there at 7:00 that
0EI3rSYARpQ88,,,  you truly a being all that wa working
0EI3rSYARpQ89,25.1,25.22,  great view of the Pacific Ocean
0EI3rSYARpQ89,,,  ox like this is awesome I think it
0EI3rSYARpQ89,,,  started until eight twenty three I wa
0EI3rSYARpQ89,,,  in the room they 're right they 're
0EI3rSYARpQ89,,,  getting their coffee and they 're
0EI3rSYARpQ89,,,  chatting around and they 're waiting for
0EI3rSYARpQ90,25.24,25.47,  everybody else and there are CEOs wait I
0EI3rSYARpQ90,,,  knew and again I had built my
0EI3rSYARpQ90,,,  presentation so that I could talk slower
0EI3rSYARpQ90,,,  or faster to get that material across
0EI3rSYARpQ90,,,  now I did say a red flag look I got mad
0EI3rSYARpQ90,,,  PowerPoint skill I can do cool thing
0EI3rSYARpQ91,25.49,26.08,  of it this is not the time I do n't know
0EI3rSYARpQ91,,,  where it is to do that keep it clean and
0EI3rSYARpQ91,,,  concise use a single font and do a
0EI3rSYARpQ91,,,  simple build you can see I 'm using
0EI3rSYARpQ91,,,  appear once in a while with my arrow
0EI3rSYARpQ91,,,  I 'll use them for emphasis but I 'm using
0EI3rSYARpQ92,26.11,26.24,  that simple bill remember direct and
0EI3rSYARpQ92,,,  guide the audience through your
0EI3rSYARpQ92,,,  presentation a little read ahead
0EI3rSYARpQ92,,,  otherwise ah
0EI3rSYARpQ92,,,  again Matt power point crease skill
0EI3rSYARpQ92,,,  we see that the rainbow or the dissolve
0EI3rSYARpQ93,26.28,26.41,  that their sin it 's a problem people
0EI3rSYARpQ93,,,  will start to count them and lose the
0EI3rSYARpQ93,,,  presentation it 's no different and when
0EI3rSYARpQ93,,,  I used to start
0EI3rSYARpQ93,,,  and again this is a very common
0EI3rSYARpQ93,,,  presentation skill how do you fill the
0EI3rSYARpQ94,26.44,27.01,  silence you know well people are
0EI3rSYARpQ94,,,  uncomfortable to present with that you
0EI3rSYARpQ94,,,  need to have that comfort people will
0EI3rSYARpQ94,,,  start to count the omen and the you
0EI3rSYARpQ94,,,  note and that overpowers that is that
0EI3rSYARpQ94,,,  presentation that 's that 's a skill that
0EI3rSYARpQ95,27.03,27.2,  you need to learn it and that come out
0EI3rSYARpQ95,,,  when you do your rehearsal here 's a
0EI3rSYARpQ95,,,  great one I 'm talking about animation
0EI3rSYARpQ95,,,  bullet everybody us dumb and when I
0EI3rSYARpQ95,,,  suppose I actually presented this a a
0EI3rSYARpQ95,,,  national ACP and Charlie did a
0EI3rSYARpQ96,27.24,27.39,  presentation after me and actually made
0EI3rSYARpQ96,,,  reference to the fact that it she 's not
0EI3rSYARpQ96,,,  taking the math you do n't have to but
0EI3rSYARpQ96,,,  it 's clean it clean that up it give
0EI3rSYARpQ96,,,  you more room for larger haunt
0EI3rSYARpQ96,,,  now guy Kawasaki is a great presenter
0EI3rSYARpQ97,27.43,28.04,  the futurist technologist I follow him
0EI3rSYARpQ97,,,  he ha a 10 rule and again it 's a
0EI3rSYARpQ97,,,  role I use it a a guide ten slide
0EI3rSYARpQ97,,,  twenty point five thirty minute it 's a
0EI3rSYARpQ97,,,  guy remember we want to build lean
0EI3rSYARpQ97,,,  content so in building that lean content
0EI3rSYARpQ98,28.07,28.2,  this is a good way to do it so what
0EI3rSYARpQ98,,,  we 've done we 've looked at building the
0EI3rSYARpQ98,,,  story we look that we know who the
0EI3rSYARpQ98,,,  audience is so you guy are ready I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ98,,,  going to turn the camera around
0EI3rSYARpQ98,,,  well it 's nervous hey they go on in
0EI3rSYARpQ99,28.28,28.46,  sometimes there 's camera there 's that
0EI3rSYARpQ99,,,  podium in front of me so now let 's get
0EI3rSYARpQ99,,,  out front let 's get in front of that
0EI3rSYARpQ99,,,  first of all do n't use the pose
0EI3rSYARpQ99,,,  psychologically it is a support
0EI3rSYARpQ99,,,  mechanism
0EI3rSYARpQ100,28.47,29,  it put me
0EI3rSYARpQ100,,,  from my audience want to come around
0EI3rSYARpQ100,,,  from the polio Hotel you do n't touch the
0EI3rSYARpQ100,,,  podium even for emphasis for
0EI3rSYARpQ100,,,  president
0EI3rSYARpQ100,,,  how doe graduation absolutely State of
0EI3rSYARpQ101,29.03,29.19,  the Union speech absolutely for u
0EI3rSYARpQ101,,,  we 're here present a material I need you
0EI3rSYARpQ101,,,  to get it get there early why you need
0EI3rSYARpQ101,,,  to have anchor now who 's an anchor if
0EI3rSYARpQ101,,,  somebody in the audience or people in
0EI3rSYARpQ101,,,  the audience right it established a
0EI3rSYARpQ102,29.21,29.36,  rapport we 've talked about it hey how 's
0EI3rSYARpQ102,,,  that coffee earth hey you came in from
0EI3rSYARpQ102,,,  the beautiful hi oh wow why because a
0EI3rSYARpQ102,,,  I 'm presenting I now have that I can
0EI3rSYARpQ102,,,  establish eye contact with those do n't
0EI3rSYARpQ102,,,  lock in just one person you 're going to
0EI3rSYARpQ103,29.39,29.51,  look over the audience establish that
0EI3rSYARpQ103,,,  eye contact it show confidence and
0EI3rSYARpQ103,,,  having those anchor are really good
0EI3rSYARpQ103,,,  because what do they think they 're going
0EI3rSYARpQ103,,,  to do when you look at them they 're
0EI3rSYARpQ103,,,  going to smile and I need that that 's
0EI3rSYARpQ104,29.54,30.03,  going to make me feel good I 'm on target
0EI3rSYARpQ104,,,  this reading the audience is going to be
0EI3rSYARpQ104,,,  very effective
0EI3rSYARpQ104,,,  remember that slide you 've got 30
0EI3rSYARpQ104,,,  second you can tell how well you 're
0EI3rSYARpQ104,,,  doing let 's set the Asia Pacific Rim
0EI3rSYARpQ105,30.06,30.16,  because they never ever look at this the
0EI3rSYARpQ105,,,  presenter they close their eye or
0EI3rSYARpQ105,,,  they 're on their laptop but I get to see
0EI3rSYARpQ105,,,  that I context like engage how well am i
0EI3rSYARpQ105,,,  doing
0EI3rSYARpQ105,,,  do I need to raise my voice up a little
0EI3rSYARpQ106,30.18,30.32,  bit to get that attention or can I keep
0EI3rSYARpQ106,,,  it we 're on that really really important
0EI3rSYARpQ106,,,  reading the audience getting those
0EI3rSYARpQ106,,,  anchor and that eye contact
0EI3rSYARpQ106,,,  so the next one engaging the audience no
0EI3rSYARpQ106,,,  upfront are you going to take question
0EI3rSYARpQ107,30.35,30.52,  during it now during a board meeting you
0EI3rSYARpQ107,,,  usually do n't have a choice why we use
0EI3rSYARpQ107,,,  the video up front but you need to make
0EI3rSYARpQ107,,,  that determination it is a skill how to
0EI3rSYARpQ107,,,  facilitate question where people that
0EI3rSYARpQ107,,,  are just like your board that want to
0EI3rSYARpQ108,30.54,31.03,  show that the audience that they know
0EI3rSYARpQ108,,,  more how do you effectively defer that
0EI3rSYARpQ108,,,  hey that 's a great question we talked
0EI3rSYARpQ108,,,  about that later because right now is
0EI3rSYARpQ108,,,  kind of doe n't relate to what I need to
0EI3rSYARpQ108,,,  do so thank you just
0EI3rSYARpQ109,31.05,31.17,  asked him a question and gave him the
0EI3rSYARpQ109,,,  answer and I wa able to move on that 's
0EI3rSYARpQ109,,,  hard it is a very difficult one to do
0EI3rSYARpQ109,,,  especially in the leadership of board
0EI3rSYARpQ109,,,  meeting so you want to ask those
0EI3rSYARpQ109,,,  question will they be asking question
0EI3rSYARpQ110,31.19,31.31,  or am I just doing the presentation and
0EI3rSYARpQ110,,,  waiting to after work Jim did a great
0EI3rSYARpQ110,,,  job and unfortunately on the WebEx you
0EI3rSYARpQ110,,,  ca n't have that interactive so we 're
0EI3rSYARpQ110,,,  going to do it at the end but again
0EI3rSYARpQ110,,,  having that set up front make a big
0EI3rSYARpQ111,31.35,31.55,  difference cause for effect the jumpa my
0EI3rSYARpQ111,,,  role so again lower corner of the screen
0EI3rSYARpQ111,,,  tell me what my next slide transition
0EI3rSYARpQ111,,,  is and it 's difficult a usual your back
0EI3rSYARpQ111,,,  is to your screen so you want to put it
0EI3rSYARpQ111,,,  there so in this case I 'd be standing on
0EI3rSYARpQ112,31.57,32.1,  this side and then be able to look to
0EI3rSYARpQ112,,,  the right and pick it up nobody ha ever
0EI3rSYARpQ112,,,  noticed it cuz again we 're keeping the
0EI3rSYARpQ112,,,  focus on that date twenty four to thirty
0EI3rSYARpQ112,,,  point one and the image and the content
0EI3rSYARpQ112,,,  but it 's just subtle so let 's talk about
0EI3rSYARpQ113,32.15,32.32,  now we 're upfront no fear or hope now
0EI3rSYARpQ113,,,  I 'm gon na tell you why you 're gon na be
0EI3rSYARpQ113,,,  successful if you 've seen American Idol
0EI3rSYARpQ113,,,  you 've been in a presentation the
0EI3rSYARpQ113,,,  audience want you to succeed they 're
0EI3rSYARpQ113,,,  cheering for you
0EI3rSYARpQ114,32.34,32.5,  early on sometimes it get to a point
0EI3rSYARpQ114,,,  where it 's a law of diminishing return
0EI3rSYARpQ114,,,  but they do they want you to succeed
0EI3rSYARpQ114,,,  here 's another another caveat healthy
0EI3rSYARpQ114,,,  life here if you 're nervous and then
0EI3rSYARpQ114,,,  you 're comfortable with that or eight
0EI3rSYARpQ115,32.51,33.03,  is n't my first time boy they 're going to

0EI3rSYARpQ126,,,  the tool you have the knowledge it 's a
0EI3rSYARpQ126,,,  matter of refining them building them
0EI3rSYARpQ126,,,  and effectively using so thank you Jim
0EI3rSYARpQ126,,,  would like to open it up for question
0EI3rSYARpQ126,,,  if there are n't yes certainly and thank
0EI3rSYARpQ127,36.19,36.33,  you so much Chris very informative and
0EI3rSYARpQ127,,,  certainly very useful and we encourage
0EI3rSYARpQ127,,,  obviously people to make the best use of
0EI3rSYARpQ127,,,  what you had to offer here today a
0EI3rSYARpQ127,,,  number of people have asked if the
0EI3rSYARpQ127,,,  slide would be available and they will
0EI3rSYARpQ128,36.36,36.53,  be you see Chris 's email right there and
0EI3rSYARpQ128,,,  if you dropped him a line he will email
0EI3rSYARpQ128,,,  you the PDF Yeah right all you 're gon na
0EI3rSYARpQ128,,,  get in the debt nothing else I 'm not
0EI3rSYARpQ128,,,  obsessed all right so a couple of the
0EI3rSYARpQ128,,,  other question oh how do you cover all
0EI3rSYARpQ129,36.56,37.08,  of your point without reading the slide
0EI3rSYARpQ129,,,  and it 's add parenthetically I agree
0EI3rSYARpQ129,,,  you should not read directly from the
0EI3rSYARpQ129,,,  slide but how do you remember all the
0EI3rSYARpQ129,,,  thing you want to communicate during
0EI3rSYARpQ129,,,  the slide ah that 's a great question
0EI3rSYARpQ130,37.13,37.27,  that 's awesome actually so thank you is
0EI3rSYARpQ130,,,  so one of the thing that I 'll do is
0EI3rSYARpQ130,,,  like right now I 'm presenting to you my
0EI3rSYARpQ130,,,  laptop is facing me and I 've got my
0EI3rSYARpQ130,,,  note up if I need them right so I can
0EI3rSYARpQ130,,,  use them a point so I can go with the
0EI3rSYARpQ131,37.29,37.41,  slide that 's coming up obviously in
0EI3rSYARpQ131,,,  presentation mode
0EI3rSYARpQ131,,,  I 've been asked on the awesome with PC
0EI3rSYARpQ131,,,  go to but I 'm just looking at the two
0EI3rSYARpQ131,,,  and I 'll use them a that and again in
0EI3rSYARpQ131,,,  building the presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ132,37.42,37.53,  and we 're urging it I 'll end up going
0EI3rSYARpQ132,,,  back and changing with the bullet head
0EI3rSYARpQ132,,,  by the way it 's not an absolutely if you
0EI3rSYARpQ132,,,  have to read the point and there 's no
0EI3rSYARpQ132,,,  way around it then you do it it 's okay
0EI3rSYARpQ132,,,  just do n't make it a habit cuz then it
0EI3rSYARpQ133,37.56,38.07,  over arch that so hopefully that
0EI3rSYARpQ133,,,  answer that question
0EI3rSYARpQ133,,,  all right there next one I 'm the one
0EI3rSYARpQ133,,,  font of slide the question is is n't
0EI3rSYARpQ133,,,  there more than one font and not just
0EI3rSYARpQ133,,,  the locos differently if you set up a
0EI3rSYARpQ134,38.14,38.26,  template it will do it for heading and
0EI3rSYARpQ134,,,  the body itself again I try to stay with
0EI3rSYARpQ134,,,  that one spot again unless I 'm making a
0EI3rSYARpQ134,,,  point and again it 's not an absolute but
0EI3rSYARpQ134,,,  I 've seen so many presentation where
0EI3rSYARpQ134,,,  it 's got time Roman Helvetica they 're
0EI3rSYARpQ135,38.28,38.42,  not even close and it distracts from the
0EI3rSYARpQ135,,,  message and again is what you 're
0EI3rSYARpQ135,,,  comfortable with I 'm just providing you
0EI3rSYARpQ135,,,  some guideline that I 've learned over
0EI3rSYARpQ135,,,  year I actually went to school with the
0EI3rSYARpQ135,,,  training exclusion for present for
0EI3rSYARpQ136,38.45,38.59,  effective presentation and training so
0EI3rSYARpQ136,,,  again it 's what you 're comfortable with
0EI3rSYARpQ136,,,  if you 're comfortable with bullet and
0EI3rSYARpQ136,,,  use them again it 's where you need to be
0EI3rSYARpQ136,,,  effective but great question alright our
0EI3rSYARpQ136,,,  next one asks if your suggestion are
0EI3rSYARpQ137,39.01,39.14,  only for board and senior management or
0EI3rSYARpQ137,,,  should they also be applied to any
0EI3rSYARpQ137,,,  presentation regardless of their level
0EI3rSYARpQ137,,,  excellent
0EI3rSYARpQ137,,,  yes and yes and yes the presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ137,,,  here
0EI3rSYARpQ138,39.15,39.26,  the presentation I do for my board are
0EI3rSYARpQ138,,,  always the same like know who my
0EI3rSYARpQ138,,,  audience is going to be I know what my
0EI3rSYARpQ138,,,  message is going to be I do n't build it
0EI3rSYARpQ138,,,  out so any of my previous and future
0EI3rSYARpQ138,,,  presentation are always going to follow
0EI3rSYARpQ139,39.28,39.46,  these guideline and I break them myself
0EI3rSYARpQ139,,,  so yeah absolutely all right the next
0EI3rSYARpQ139,,,  attendee say you use some great image
0EI3rSYARpQ139,,,  in your presentation where did you find
0EI3rSYARpQ139,,,  them all did you just start googling the
0EI3rSYARpQ139,,,  meaning or is there one or two place
0EI3rSYARpQ140,39.47,40.02,  you go to actually I use dr. Google a
0EI3rSYARpQ140,,,  extensively and then what I 'm looking
0EI3rSYARpQ140,,,  for you
0EI3rSYARpQ140,,,  is a PNG file it will have a transparent
0EI3rSYARpQ140,,,  background I do a lot of Photoshop work
0EI3rSYARpQ140,,,  so that I can take my image into
0EI3rSYARpQ141,40.05,40.16,  Photoshop and utilize them a well so
0EI3rSYARpQ141,,,  for example but thank you I a you see
0EI3rSYARpQ141,,,  here it 's a little pixelated but I
0EI3rSYARpQ141,,,  could n't find it any better other than
0EI3rSYARpQ141,,,  doing it myself our challenge and
0EI3rSYARpQ141,,,  image is a lot of them will have a
0EI3rSYARpQ142,40.19,40.32,  watermark to pay for them right you got
0EI3rSYARpQ142,,,  to buy those but if you click view
0EI3rSYARpQ142,,,  similar and start to refine your search
0EI3rSYARpQ142,,,  you 'll find them so it absolutely is you
0EI3rSYARpQ142,,,  know it 's basically Google if you have a
0EI3rSYARpQ142,,,  medium department in your organization
0EI3rSYARpQ143,40.34,40.5,  you 're that fortunate usable I when
0EI3rSYARpQ143,,,  you 're in a team presentation if one of
0EI3rSYARpQ143,,,  the presenter state something
0EI3rSYARpQ143,,,  incorrectly you have any suggestion on
0EI3rSYARpQ143,,,  how you might correct them or add to
0EI3rSYARpQ143,,,  what they say to help make it accurate
0EI3rSYARpQ144,40.52,41.14,  oh politically question first of
0EI3rSYARpQ144,,,  all when governor thank you I 'm sorry
0EI3rSYARpQ144,,,  it 's a politically charged question do I
0EI3rSYARpQ144,,,  want to be General Custer on this one do
0EI3rSYARpQ144,,,  I let it go doe it change the rest of
0EI3rSYARpQ144,,,  the presentation it really is going to
0EI3rSYARpQ145,41.17,41.3,  depend on the situation that 's a really
0EI3rSYARpQ145,,,  hard one and I 've done team
0EI3rSYARpQ145,,,  presentation with my own organization I
0EI3rSYARpQ145,,,  think we refine me or I may just let it
0EI3rSYARpQ145,,,  go again it really depends on where we
0EI3rSYARpQ145,,,  are in the in the in the field or the
0EI3rSYARpQ146,41.32,41.47,  deck all right this next one say when
0EI3rSYARpQ146,,,  right on this next one now when training
0EI3rSYARpQ146,,,  and I have to excuse me back it up a
0EI3rSYARpQ146,,,  little bit here to get from the
0EI3rSYARpQ146,,,  beginning oh when training how do you
0EI3rSYARpQ146,,,  address people who are on their laptop
0EI3rSYARpQ147,41.49,42.02,  or phone or read to re their
0EI3rSYARpQ147,,,  attention training all the manager in
0EI3rSYARpQ147,,,  my department this person say they have
0EI3rSYARpQ147,,,  a terrible habit of tuning out and being
0EI3rSYARpQ147,,,  a level lower addressing this is a bit
0EI3rSYARpQ147,,,  sensitive okay so what I 'll do is
0EI3rSYARpQ148,42.08,42.19,  usually say at the beginning
0EI3rSYARpQ148,,,  the presentation I 've got a lot of
0EI3rSYARpQ148,,,  material or kind of make note of it you
0EI3rSYARpQ148,,,  material or kind of make note of it you
0EI3rSYARpQ148,,,  know I appreciate it you can silence put
0EI3rSYARpQ148,,,  your phone down and close your laptop 's
0EI3rSYARpQ148,,,  so that I 'm able to provide a more
0EI3rSYARpQ149,42.21,42.33,  effective presentation I 'm putting it on
0EI3rSYARpQ149,,,  me I 'm able to provide a more effective
0EI3rSYARpQ149,,,  presentation that will resound with you
0EI3rSYARpQ149,,,  I kind of put it I mean I did n't tell
0EI3rSYARpQ149,,,  you to do it I 've asked gently and
0EI3rSYARpQ149,,,  nicely so you can make that your own
0EI3rSYARpQ150,42.35,42.49,  word but that 's a challenge I do well I
0EI3rSYARpQ150,,,  did a presentation in the Pacific Rim
0EI3rSYARpQ150,,,  and they all I did n't see any eye and I
0EI3rSYARpQ150,,,  thought it wa like my presentation I
0EI3rSYARpQ150,,,  learned that that 's a cultural piece so
0EI3rSYARpQ150,,,  again it 's what 's my level of exception
0EI3rSYARpQ151,42.53,43.12,  threshold of pain okay our next one how
0EI3rSYARpQ151,,,  do you make all of your point without
0EI3rSYARpQ151,,,  bullet any hint tip yes so let 's
0EI3rSYARpQ151,,,  let 's go back right I 'm gon na go back in
0EI3rSYARpQ151,,,  here I just turned the bullet the bullet
0EI3rSYARpQ151,,,  point off here and what I do is all
0EI3rSYARpQ152,43.16,43.32,  cheat a well I 'll open that up because
0EI3rSYARpQ152,,,  that bullet take about a full font
0EI3rSYARpQ152,,,  that bullet take about a full font
0EI3rSYARpQ152,,,  letter away so for example if I have the
0EI3rSYARpQ152,,,  audience is here for a reason it wo n't
0EI3rSYARpQ152,,,  fit so again it 's a style thing I 've
0EI3rSYARpQ152,,,  actually gone through might have some
0EI3rSYARpQ153,43.34,43.49,  way older stuff and if I 'm you reusing
0EI3rSYARpQ153,,,  it or rebuilding it and I take it away
0EI3rSYARpQ153,,,  sometimes again I 'll leave it in it 's a
0EI3rSYARpQ153,,,  comfort level alright and could you
0EI3rSYARpQ153,,,  please repeat the name of the site where
0EI3rSYARpQ153,,,  you get your slide um do n't be
0EI3rSYARpQ154,43.55,44.06,  available through ACP correct
0EI3rSYARpQ154,,,  Jim no I mean the one the one do I
0EI3rSYARpQ154,,,  think they mean the one that you use in
0EI3rSYARpQ154,,,  your PowerPoint uh again I 'll hand this
0EI3rSYARpQ154,,,  down these are actually hyperlink a
0EI3rSYARpQ154,,,  well but the big one that Department of
0EI3rSYARpQ155,44.09,44.2,  Homeland Security and they 've changed
0EI3rSYARpQ155,,,  like Tessa Tessa ha n't done a lot but
0EI3rSYARpQ155,,,  God ha done quite a bit so there 's a
0EI3rSYARpQ155,,,  lot more out there but again it just
0EI3rSYARpQ155,,,  sent me an email
0EI3rSYARpQ155,,,  I 'll tell you the deck and I 'll expose
0EI3rSYARpQ156,44.22,44.35,  the hyperlink
0EI3rSYARpQ156,,,  I write for the image themselves if you
0EI3rSYARpQ156,,,  look at the number of image there 's
0EI3rSYARpQ156,,,  probably about a hundred image here I
0EI3rSYARpQ156,,,  do n't keep track of where I get them I
0EI3rSYARpQ156,,,  usually take them all that it 's own
0EI3rSYARpQ157,44.37,44.52,  clean them up and I just throw them in
0EI3rSYARpQ157,,,  that 's the difficult if you have a
0EI3rSYARpQ157,,,  specific want you me an email and I 'd
0EI3rSYARpQ157,,,  be more than happy to see if I swear I
0EI3rSYARpQ157,,,  got it from all right the next question
0EI3rSYARpQ157,,,  asks do you share your note and talk
0EI3rSYARpQ158,44.55,45.05,  track with the audience after the
0EI3rSYARpQ158,,,  presentation and if not how do you
0EI3rSYARpQ158,,,  ensure that they have all the
0EI3rSYARpQ158,,,  information that you verbally shared ah
0EI3rSYARpQ158,,,  great question
0EI3rSYARpQ158,,,  first of all they get recorded like this
0EI3rSYARpQ159,45.07,45.2,  when she doe it I 've stopped depending
0EI3rSYARpQ159,,,  on the presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ159,,,  there 'll be sporadic note that are in
0EI3rSYARpQ159,,,  there so if they want the slide you
0EI3rSYARpQ159,,,  do n't give them them with the note but
0EI3rSYARpQ159,,,  more often it it 's this type of effect
0EI3rSYARpQ160,45.22,45.34,  where you know having that benefit of
0EI3rSYARpQ160,,,  being a member of a CP you have access
0EI3rSYARpQ160,,,  to it at any time on and again it
0EI3rSYARpQ160,,,  slide were there a well so I again the
0EI3rSYARpQ160,,,  more you do the presentation and
0EI3rSYARpQ160,,,  present the le you use your note a
0EI3rSYARpQ161,45.37,45.53,  you go okay our next one is X what asks
0EI3rSYARpQ161,,,  what is the best way to gain interaction
0EI3rSYARpQ161,,,  or awareness if you feel the room is
0EI3rSYARpQ161,,,  dead do you recommend calling someone
0EI3rSYARpQ161,,,  out with a question to help gain some
0EI3rSYARpQ161,,,  traction ah calling somebody out buy
0EI3rSYARpQ162,45.57,46.16,  by individual can be deadly especially
0EI3rSYARpQ162,,,  if they 're not paying attention so uh
0EI3rSYARpQ162,,,  stop they so I have a question for you
0EI3rSYARpQ162,,,  in the audience so alright so I now
0EI3rSYARpQ162,,,  telling them to pay attention let me ask
0EI3rSYARpQ162,,,  you you know in doing a presentation and
0EI3rSYARpQ163,46.2,46.33,  I 'll look over in this direction but I
0EI3rSYARpQ163,,,  wo n't ask anybody there 's anybody here
0EI3rSYARpQ163,,,  think that the color are too bad when
0EI3rSYARpQ163,,,  the background make a difference right
0EI3rSYARpQ163,,,  so um but I 've got to be prepared and it
0EI3rSYARpQ163,,,  may be you over here go great doe
0EI3rSYARpQ164,46.35,46.48,  anybody else want to comment
0EI3rSYARpQ164,,,  so it again it go back to engaging the
0EI3rSYARpQ164,,,  audience
0EI3rSYARpQ164,,,  when I present I take question a they
0EI3rSYARpQ164,,,  come but that again come with time and
0EI3rSYARpQ164,,,  practice and failure where you 're now
0EI3rSYARpQ165,46.53,47.08,  sweating on the stage because somebody 's
0EI3rSYARpQ165,,,  dominating it you do n't know how to get
0EI3rSYARpQ165,,,  it back it 's like being a comedian right
0EI3rSYARpQ165,,,  the heckler so that 's good that 's a good
0EI3rSYARpQ165,,,  one hopefully the house there 's a little
0EI3rSYARpQ165,,,  curiosity a to why you object to the
0EI3rSYARpQ166,47.1,47.3,  use of bullet point ah for me it 's just
0EI3rSYARpQ166,,,  keeping the slide cleaner there seems to
0EI3rSYARpQ166,,,  be a trend in professional presenter
0EI3rSYARpQ166,,,  there 's another one bullet point are
0EI3rSYARpQ166,,,  for kitten there 's a couple of you know
0EI3rSYARpQ166,,,  if you actually look out there so again
0EI3rSYARpQ167,47.32,47.46,  it 's all personal preference I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ167,,,  presenting I want my material to look a
0EI3rSYARpQ167,,,  little differently a well and again I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ167,,,  using a large spot I want a much of
0EI3rSYARpQ167,,,  that screen a I can use see that 's why
0EI3rSYARpQ167,,,  in again you notice I do n't have a lot
0EI3rSYARpQ168,47.48,48,  of sub I 'll use those a talking
0EI3rSYARpQ168,,,  point in my title of my draft I 'll use
0EI3rSYARpQ168,,,  them a I can talk and present practice
0EI3rSYARpQ168,,,  it but then I go back and I 'll remove
0EI3rSYARpQ168,,,  them because they become talking point
0EI3rSYARpQ168,,,  one of those logic talk about I write
0EI3rSYARpQ169,48.02,48.16,  you you guy immediately went to that
0EI3rSYARpQ169,,,  visualization of the eye because I
0EI3rSYARpQ169,,,  mentioned that and you remember that but
0EI3rSYARpQ169,,,  I had in there talking about it instills
0EI3rSYARpQ169,,,  confidence I took it out because I knew
0EI3rSYARpQ169,,,  what I wanted to do America nursing so
0EI3rSYARpQ170,48.18,48.32,  again bullet point again it 's personal
0EI3rSYARpQ170,,,  everybody want to feel comfortable in
0EI3rSYARpQ170,,,  their presentation and I thought the
0EI3rSYARpQ170,,,  bullet for the NRA wa a cute one and
0EI3rSYARpQ170,,,  how do you keep your audience engaged
0EI3rSYARpQ170,,,  during a web or a screen share session
0EI3rSYARpQ171,48.35,48.48,  oh these are the hardest I will tell you
0EI3rSYARpQ171,,,  better brighten that up and that is one
0EI3rSYARpQ171,,,  of the thing is changing it up is if
0EI3rSYARpQ171,,,  I 'm presenting I wanted you to see me
0EI3rSYARpQ171,,,  and it 's why because talking to a webcam
0EI3rSYARpQ171,,,  or a speaker
0EI3rSYARpQ172,48.5,49.03,  is very difficult there 's no there 's no
0EI3rSYARpQ172,,,  way around it you know people are on
0EI3rSYARpQ172,,,  email they 're on Facebook while you 're
0EI3rSYARpQ172,,,  doing this you do n't know and again
0EI3rSYARpQ172,,,  that 's where the rehearsal it 's got to
0EI3rSYARpQ172,,,  be comfortable in that you 're like I
0EI3rSYARpQ173,49.06,49.2,  find when I do a webinar I 'm actually
0EI3rSYARpQ173,,,  talking faster cuz I do n't have anybody
0EI3rSYARpQ173,,,  in the room so but we were not in my
0EI3rSYARpQ173,,,  office today I have an audience
0EI3rSYARpQ173,,,  did you again not going to need an
0EI3rSYARpQ173,,,  anchor but it 's going to keep my pace
0EI3rSYARpQ174,49.23,49.36,  where it is if I 'm using them a engaged
0EI3rSYARpQ174,,,  but webinars are the hardest when they
0EI3rSYARpQ174,,,  CP asked me to do this I 've done this
0EI3rSYARpQ174,,,  for them in person in the national my
0EI3rSYARpQ174,,,  marketing team did a great immediate
0EI3rSYARpQ174,,,  communication she did an awesome job of
0EI3rSYARpQ175,49.38,49.51,  setting it up in this way so that I
0EI3rSYARpQ175,,,  could do it all the way sitting at my
0EI3rSYARpQ175,,,  desk is difficult well here 's a good one
0EI3rSYARpQ175,,,  how do you keep track if the audience
0EI3rSYARpQ175,,,  ask question a you 're going along this
0EI3rSYARpQ175,,,  person that say he or she tends to lose
0EI3rSYARpQ176,49.55,50.1,  the trail of thought with all the
0EI3rSYARpQ176,,,  interruption from the audience
0EI3rSYARpQ176,,,  ah so two thing on the podium or near
0EI3rSYARpQ176,,,  the podium I have my phone with a timer
0EI3rSYARpQ176,,,  so I 'm watching the clock I 'm not doing
0EI3rSYARpQ176,,,  that I know how long this take but what
0EI3rSYARpQ177,50.14,50.25,  I 'll do is hey that 's great I 'll kind of
0EI3rSYARpQ177,,,  bring it back in by saying you know can
0EI3rSYARpQ177,,,  we table that here can you talk to me
0EI3rSYARpQ177,,,  afterwards about it cuz I know where I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ177,,,  at with my debt I can see my powerpoint
0EI3rSYARpQ177,,,  I know what my next slide is and they
0EI3rSYARpQ178,50.28,50.41,  need to bring it back in
0EI3rSYARpQ178,,,  sometimes it 's graceful it 's not sort of
0EI3rSYARpQ178,,,  graceful but you know it 's inner you
0EI3rSYARpQ178,,,  know what interest of respecting your
0EI3rSYARpQ178,,,  time can we hold question to the end
0EI3rSYARpQ178,,,  but I like the finish the presentation
0EI3rSYARpQ179,50.44,50.56,  and I know it 's great please write them
0EI3rSYARpQ179,,,  down or let 's hold them to the end
0EI3rSYARpQ179,,,  so again again taking that control back
0EI3rSYARpQ179,,,  recognizing what they want and it is
0EI3rSYARpQ179,,,  important I 'm looking at somebody right
0EI3rSYARpQ179,,,  now make that sense that again notice
0EI3rSYARpQ180,50.59,51.1,  my hand gesture I 'm going like this I 'm
0EI3rSYARpQ180,,,  being open I 'm wrecking my
0EI3rSYARpQ180,,,  that person they 're actually smiling at
0EI3rSYARpQ180,,,  me so it make it show that that we 're
0EI3rSYARpQ180,,,  good and if they 're not to my man it 's
0EI3rSYARpQ180,,,  gon na keep going anyway
0EI3rSYARpQ181,51.12,51.24,  but again use your time allocated
0EI3rSYARpQ181,,,  recognized always recognize that the
0EI3rSYARpQ181,,,  question and it is decide whether you
0EI3rSYARpQ181,,,  need to answer it or defer it and then
0EI3rSYARpQ181,,,  just say hey I have a lot of question
0EI3rSYARpQ181,,,  this is great I 'm excited about that
0EI3rSYARpQ182,51.26,51.43,  but we need to get through this

0EI3rSYARpQ192,,,  rest of the day everyone
ryXOW1QS0ZM1,0.06,0.23,  For seven year I presented the news
ryXOW1QS0ZM1,,,  on television and every thursday I wa there in front of my camera
ryXOW1QS0ZM1,,,  and I heard the director in my ear saying : Attention studio for life
ryXOW1QS0ZM1,,,  5 4 3 ...
ryXOW1QS0ZM1,,,  and every Thursday
ryXOW1QS0ZM1,,,  I felt my heart racing . Every week seven year ...
ryXOW1QS0ZM2,0.27,0.47,  Now I tell you this because there is this huge misunderstanding
ryXOW1QS0ZM2,,,  that experienced speaker they are not nervous . When you see that speaker on
ryXOW1QS0ZM2,,,  stage and you say like like : `` Well they do it in a natural way ''
ryXOW1QS0ZM2,,,  No they do n't . They are nervous . But the difference to me
ryXOW1QS0ZM2,,,  between an experienced and inexperienced speaker is that experience people
ryXOW1QS0ZM2,,,  know how to handle the nerve . I want to give you this insight because it
ryXOW1QS0ZM3,0.52,1.08,  really helped me a lot
ryXOW1QS0ZM3,,,  to deal with my nerve .
ryXOW1QS0ZM3,,,  Because it all begin with the brain . That 's where my explanation begin .
ryXOW1QS0ZM3,,,  Because you have to look at your brain
ryXOW1QS0ZM3,,,  a having these different antenna
ryXOW1QS0ZM3,,,  Your brain really want to protect yourself and it take that job very seriously
ryXOW1QS0ZM4,1.12,1.29,  So a soon a the antenna perceive a kind of danger
ryXOW1QS0ZM4,,,  a button is pushed . It 's a button somewhere here
ryXOW1QS0ZM4,,,  in your head in your brain and it 's called the amygdala . It ha to shape
ryXOW1QS0ZM4,,,  of an almond the color of an almond .
ryXOW1QS0ZM4,,,  It is small a an almond It is a very important button
ryXOW1QS0ZM4,,,  because a soon a the button is pushed that 's what we call the fight or flight reaction
ryXOW1QS0ZM5,1.33,1.49,  You have all these sensation in your body typically the thing that you experience
ryXOW1QS0ZM5,,,  when you are nervous
ryXOW1QS0ZM5,,,  like a dry mouth
ryXOW1QS0ZM5,,,  Legs shaking your heart really beating very fast
ryXOW1QS0ZM5,,,  your respiration is going faster and
ryXOW1QS0ZM5,,,  this is something that actually is there to protect yourself because
ryXOW1QS0ZM6,1.54,2.14,  a it is a fight or flight reaction imagine that there is this car
ryXOW1QS0ZM6,,,  nearly racing into you when you when you cross a road . The fact that you have this
ryXOW1QS0ZM6,,,  Heart beat that is faster it actually prepares you
ryXOW1QS0ZM6,,,  to react and to run actually
ryXOW1QS0ZM6,,,  Now the thing is when you stand in front of an audience
ryXOW1QS0ZM6,,,  you can not run . So the antenna they do n't make a difference between
ryXOW1QS0ZM7,2.19,2.38,  real danger and a danger in your head . So what happens is when you
ryXOW1QS0ZM7,,,  in front of your audience you can not run you kind of freeze
ryXOW1QS0ZM7,,,  but still you have these sensation so you want to protect yourself
ryXOW1QS0ZM7,,,  now this is on a subconscious level
ryXOW1QS0ZM7,,,  what happens on a conscious level is that actually
ryXOW1QS0ZM7,,,  when you stand in front of your audience you want to protect yourselve
ryXOW1QS0ZM8,2.42,3,  actually by doing this now this is overdoing it but
ryXOW1QS0ZM8,,,  to some extent that 's what speaker actually do in front of an audience
ryXOW1QS0ZM8,,,  stand like that you really want to protect yourself looking down looking
ryXOW1QS0ZM8,,,  very quickly from one person to another
ryXOW1QS0ZM8,,,  Now what doe an experienced speaker do ? Exactly the opposite
ryXOW1QS0ZM8,,,  They on a conscious level
ryXOW1QS0ZM9,3.03,3.24,  They make themselves big in front of the audience you could say that they fake it
ryXOW1QS0ZM9,,,  making yourself big what I mean with that is
ryXOW1QS0ZM9,,,  having that posture in in front of your audience
ryXOW1QS0ZM9,,,  that give you a kind of a positive attitude . Now to know what that is
ryXOW1QS0ZM9,,,  just watch television . You can really learn a lot from it
ryXOW1QS0ZM9,,,  And I advise you to look especially at people for example presenting the news
ryXOW1QS0ZM10,3.29,3.49,  but people standing because that 's the most difficult thing to do have to stand
ryXOW1QS0ZM10,,,  in front of that audience what to do with your arm what to do with your leg
ryXOW1QS0ZM10,,,  just look at how they stand and imitate that
ryXOW1QS0ZM10,,,  because this is a good neutral position same thing for the way you look
ryXOW1QS0ZM10,,,  tip that I have there is that you actually look at your audience
ryXOW1QS0ZM10,,,  a if you pour them a glass of wine because this will help you
ryXOW1QS0ZM11,3.53,4.11,  to stay with one person you look at one
ryXOW1QS0ZM11,,,  individual at the time . The time it take
ryXOW1QS0ZM11,,,  to pour them a glass of wine . To avoid that you would either look away
ryXOW1QS0ZM11,,,  or look very nervously from one person to another
ryXOW1QS0ZM11,,,  so the next time you experience these nerve
ryXOW1QS0ZM11,,,  what I advise you to do is stand
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,4.14,4.47,  and look it a conscious way just watch television
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  to know what that can be and watch Ted.com
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  because on that website you have all these presentation with PowerPoint
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  without PowerPoint
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  look at it without volume because it help you to look how they stand
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  What I absolutely advise you to do is watch
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  Amy Cuddy she 's an expert on body language
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  and this is exactly what she 's talking about about faking it
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  to just have a look imitate integrate
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,,,  and make it your own .
wd9reH4g--Y1,0.03,0.19,  hello everybody great time seems to be
wd9reH4g--Y1,,,  getting lot of yes so that 's
wd9reH4g--Y1,,,  fantastic so welcome presentation skill
wd9reH4g--Y1,,,  and confidence in public speaking I 'm
wd9reH4g--Y1,,,  wondering what your thought are about
wd9reH4g--Y1,,,  what scare either you in public
wd9reH4g--Y2,0.24,0.39,  speaking or perhaps your student and
wd9reH4g--Y2,,,  what the challenge are an awkward
wd9reH4g--Y2,,,  nurse 'll knowledge or topic expertise or
wd9reH4g--Y2,,,  connection with the audience there are
wd9reH4g--Y2,,,  lot of issue that get in the way of
wd9reH4g--Y2,,,  people being really great public
wd9reH4g--Y3,0.41,0.57,  speaker and some of the thing that I 'd
wd9reH4g--Y3,,,  like to explore today are about mindset
wd9reH4g--Y3,,,  attitude and about our delivery style
wd9reH4g--Y3,,,  and how we can that take a little bit
wd9reH4g--Y3,,,  more control of our voice and body
wd9reH4g--Y3,,,  and our relationship with the audience
wd9reH4g--Y4,0.59,1.14,  and then a little bit on content I do n't
wd9reH4g--Y4,,,  know if any of you were present for the
wd9reH4g--Y4,,,  storytelling webinar that we did a few
wd9reH4g--Y4,,,  month ago that had quite a lot on
wd9reH4g--Y4,,,  narrative and content but we 'll revisit
wd9reH4g--Y4,,,  a little bit of those principle bit a
wd9reH4g--Y5,1.16,1.35,  bit of that and it principle today so
wd9reH4g--Y5,,,  yes three three main topic for today
wd9reH4g--Y5,,,  and another thing it might be helpful to
wd9reH4g--Y5,,,  think about is to have a topic in mind
wd9reH4g--Y5,,,  for yourself so that when we 're
wd9reH4g--Y5,,,  discussing strategy or activity or
wd9reH4g--Y6,1.38,1.53,  idea that you might be able to apply
wd9reH4g--Y6,,,  some of your thinking to a particular
wd9reH4g--Y6,,,  topic which might be about your teaching
wd9reH4g--Y6,,,  it might be about this very topic okay
wd9reH4g--Y6,,,  so
wd9reH4g--Y6,,,  there are the way I see it is that there
wd9reH4g--Y7,1.58,2.13,  are three principal element that we
wd9reH4g--Y7,,,  need to think about what we have
wd9reH4g--Y7,,,  available to u are our self a the
wd9reH4g--Y7,,,  presenter and of course our relationship
wd9reH4g--Y7,,,  with the audience and what they need and
wd9reH4g--Y7,,,  then the message the content and
wd9reH4g--Y8,2.16,2.42,  everything that we do in a presentation
wd9reH4g--Y8,,,  is to the end of meeting the purpose
wd9reH4g--Y8,,,  that we want to achieve so presentation
wd9reH4g--Y8,,,  are not a particularly effective time
wd9reH4g--Y8,,,  effective or efficient way of getting
wd9reH4g--Y8,,,  information across that 's obvious
wd9reH4g--Y9,2.44,3.02,  you know requires people in a room
wd9reH4g--Y9,,,  together and that is quite resource a B
wd9reH4g--Y9,,,  so one thing to think about is how can
wd9reH4g--Y9,,,  we most powerfully Drive the message
wd9reH4g--Y9,,,  through that we want to drive through
wd9reH4g--Y9,,,  and more importantly how do we help
wd9reH4g--Y10,3.04,3.18,  people to remember them now what
wd9reH4g--Y10,,,  presentation and public speaking are
wd9reH4g--Y10,,,  very good for is creating relationship
wd9reH4g--Y10,,,  with an audience
wd9reH4g--Y10,,,  so although audience do n't remember
wd9reH4g--Y10,,,  very much and that 's where we need to
wd9reH4g--Y11,3.2,3.32,  think about how we craft the message in
wd9reH4g--Y11,,,  the delivery so that we help them to
wd9reH4g--Y11,,,  remember what they 're grateful is
wd9reH4g--Y11,,,  influencing people and encouraging them
wd9reH4g--Y11,,,  to get on board with idea because we
wd9reH4g--Y11,,,  are usually either present in the room
wd9reH4g--Y12,3.35,3.51,  with them or they can see and hear u by
wd9reH4g--Y12,,,  some other mean so it 's a very special
wd9reH4g--Y12,,,  thing public speaking and it 's partly
wd9reH4g--Y12,,,  why it make people so vulnerable I
wd9reH4g--Y12,,,  think is because it 's all about creating
wd9reH4g--Y12,,,  a real relationship
wd9reH4g--Y13,3.56,4.14,  so I 'm hoping that everybody can see in
wd9reH4g--Y13,,,  here now in creating this relationship
wd9reH4g--Y13,,,  so we 've got me and the audience for the
wd9reH4g--Y13,,,  message and that mean that I need to be
wd9reH4g--Y13,,,  credible I need to be trustworthy and to
wd9reH4g--Y13,,,  be the right person speaking on the
wd9reH4g--Y14,4.15,4.33,  topic and to have passion for my subject
wd9reH4g--Y14,,,  I need to be aware of what the audience
wd9reH4g--Y14,,,  need and in content term putting those
wd9reH4g--Y14,,,  two together I need to be relevant so
wd9reH4g--Y14,,,  it 's not really good enough to just
wd9reH4g--Y14,,,  think about everything that we would
wd9reH4g--Y15,4.34,4.48,  like to say on the topic we really need
wd9reH4g--Y15,,,  to focus it down to what the audience
wd9reH4g--Y15,,,  need and care about and that is still
wd9reH4g--Y15,,,  predicated by what is the aim of this
wd9reH4g--Y15,,,  presentation but if the purpose so we
wd9reH4g--Y15,,,  always start with the purpose so there
wd9reH4g--Y16,4.59,5.09,  are way in which we can practice
wd9reH4g--Y16,,,  thinking about what an audience need
wd9reH4g--Y16,,,  and the kind of conversation that we
wd9reH4g--Y16,,,  want to have with them when they 're
wd9reH4g--Y16,,,  concerned from their value what are
wd9reH4g--Y16,,,  their priority what is their level of
wd9reH4g--Y17,5.12,5.3,  experience and expertise in the topic
wd9reH4g--Y17,,,  what is it that they need so I 've got an
wd9reH4g--Y17,,,  activity that you might not arrive
wd9reH4g--Y17,,,  yourself or with your student and it 's
wd9reH4g--Y17,,,  a peer activity which is about
wd9reH4g--Y17,,,  explaining thing to somebody who ha no
wd9reH4g--Y18,5.33,5.53,  context they 're not the expert on this
wd9reH4g--Y18,,,  topic and this is the activity and it 's
wd9reH4g--Y18,,,  really quite straightforward to execute
wd9reH4g--Y18,,,  the subtlety come in really teasing out
wd9reH4g--Y18,,,  whether this person from the past that
wd9reH4g--Y18,,,  we 're imagining we 're talking to really
wd9reH4g--Y19,5.55,6.07,  truly understands and ha a context for
wd9reH4g--Y19,,,  what we 're saying by the time we
wd9reH4g--Y19,,,  finished explaining so we have two
wd9reH4g--Y19,,,  people we choose and love an object
wd9reH4g--Y19,,,  between if it could
wd9reH4g--Y19,,,  or a microwave or a phone or an
wd9reH4g--Y20,6.1,6.27,  aeroplane anything that would n't have
wd9reH4g--Y20,,,  existed 100 200 300 year ago and your
wd9reH4g--Y20,,,  partner imago they are that person
wd9reH4g--Y20,,,  from the past and you your job is to
wd9reH4g--Y20,,,  help your partner to really understand
wd9reH4g--Y20,,,  what this piece of technology or
wd9reH4g--Y21,6.29,6.45,  appliance or object is for and how it
wd9reH4g--Y21,,,  benefit your life and how it could
wd9reH4g--Y21,,,  benefit their life and their job is to
wd9reH4g--Y21,,,  absolutely challenge and ask question
wd9reH4g--Y21,,,  at any point they do n't have a reference
wd9reH4g--Y21,,,  or do n't understand what you 're saying
wd9reH4g--Y22,6.47,7.08,  and in that way we really have to
wd9reH4g--Y22,,,  interrogate whether we are meeting our
wd9reH4g--Y22,,,  audience value system their context
wd9reH4g--Y22,,,  their culture and it 's a really lovely
wd9reH4g--Y22,,,  fun way of starting to think about what
wd9reH4g--Y22,,,  doe an audience need how do I step into
wd9reH4g--Y23,7.12,7.26,  their shoe a a presenter or a public
wd9reH4g--Y23,,,  speaker and in my preparation than in my
wd9reH4g--Y23,,,  imagination try and focus it a closely
wd9reH4g--Y23,,,  a I possibly can towards them so that
wd9reH4g--Y23,,,  we can really have a conversation that 's
wd9reH4g--Y23,,,  meaningful and that I 'm not just
wd9reH4g--Y24,7.27,7.39,  blinding them with thing that they
wd9reH4g--Y24,,,  do n't think are important or relevant to
wd9reH4g--Y24,,,  people get that can I just have a quick
wd9reH4g--Y24,,,  response a to whether people understand
wd9reH4g--Y24,,,  that activity but if not I 'll say a
wd9reH4g--Y24,,,  little bit more about it if I need to
wd9reH4g--Y25,7.43,7.59,  anybody would have it in yes yes yes
wd9reH4g--Y25,,,  cool that 's great that 's really great
wd9reH4g--Y25,,,  okay if anybody have any question of
wd9reH4g--Y25,,,  course we can come back to them at the
wd9reH4g--Y25,,,  end so okay moving on a little bit and
wd9reH4g--Y25,,,  thinking about u and our delivery style
wd9reH4g--Y26,8.02,8.25,  and being confident looking and sounding
wd9reH4g--Y26,,,  confident
wd9reH4g--Y26,,,  so we know that there are body posture
wd9reH4g--Y26,,,  and physical attitude that make u feel
wd9reH4g--Y26,,,  and look confidence and credible and
wd9reH4g--Y26,,,  comfortable and they involve being
wd9reH4g--Y27,8.28,8.48,  relaxed and they involve being alert and
wd9reH4g--Y27,,,  energized and they involve in an ideal
wd9reH4g--Y27,,,  world having quite a strong awareness of
wd9reH4g--Y27,,,  the impact that our physical habit have
wd9reH4g--Y27,,,  so I 'm just going to talk you through
wd9reH4g--Y27,,,  one way of starting to become aware of
wd9reH4g--Y28,8.51,9.04,  your posture and to become centered and
wd9reH4g--Y28,,,  to look confident so I 'm going to invite
wd9reH4g--Y28,,,  you either to try this if you can
wd9reH4g--Y28,,,  standing up or if not just stay in your
wd9reH4g--Y28,,,  chair and we will we 'll do it from there
wd9reH4g--Y28,,,  so start with your foot about hip
wd9reH4g--Y29,9.09,9.2,  apart and if you 're standing obviously
wd9reH4g--Y29,,,  there on the floor if you 're sitting
wd9reH4g--Y29,,,  really grounding your foot into the
wd9reH4g--Y29,,,  floor okay
wd9reH4g--Y29,,,  so you get a sense of of being very
wd9reH4g--Y29,,,  solid in the lower body and relaxing
wd9reH4g--Y30,9.23,9.41,  your knee and unlocking any tension and
wd9reH4g--Y30,,,  sitting or standing really balanced so
wd9reH4g--Y30,,,  you 're not slumping forward you 're not
wd9reH4g--Y30,,,  arching your back you 're allowing your
wd9reH4g--Y30,,,  spine just to really release towards the
wd9reH4g--Y30,,,  ceiling crown of your head floating
wd9reH4g--Y31,9.42,9.54,  towards the ceiling so you 're thinking
wd9reH4g--Y31,,,  about lengthening in height and also
wd9reH4g--Y31,,,  just allowing your chest to open a
wd9reH4g--Y31,,,  little bit and soften and so you 're
wd9reH4g--Y31,,,  imagining spreading a little bit width
wd9reH4g--Y31,,,  wise a well and your head position
wd9reH4g--Y32,9.58,10.15,  ideally is so that your chin is more or
wd9reH4g--Y32,,,  le parallel with the floor and in
wd9reH4g--Y32,,,  presenting coaching we do a lot of work
wd9reH4g--Y32,,,  on our physical body and on our face
wd9reH4g--Y32,,,  and our eye contact a well a our
wd9reH4g--Y32,,,  voice
wd9reH4g--Y33,10.16,10.29,  because the first thing that people
wd9reH4g--Y33,,,  perceive about you is what you look like
wd9reH4g--Y33,,,  and very small adjustment can make a
wd9reH4g--Y33,,,  really big difference to that so I 'm
wd9reH4g--Y33,,,  also going to invite you just to let
wd9reH4g--Y33,,,  your shoulder drop away from your ear
wd9reH4g--Y34,10.32,10.49,  a little bit just scratch them off and
wd9reH4g--Y34,,,  let them go and start to start to tune
wd9reH4g--Y34,,,  in to when you feel relaxed and
wd9reH4g--Y34,,,  comfortable and mobile and when you have
wd9reH4g--Y34,,,  tension in your body and start to think
wd9reH4g--Y34,,,  about how to let it go just relax those
wd9reH4g--Y35,10.51,11.08,  muscle that might be holding tension
wd9reH4g--Y35,,,  that make you feel and look le
wd9reH4g--Y35,,,  confident and comfortable than perhaps
wd9reH4g--Y35,,,  you could be and little illustration of
wd9reH4g--Y35,,,  what that might look like so
wd9reH4g--Y35,,,  our chat on on the left there who 's
wd9reH4g--Y36,11.11,11.23,  slumping forward and looking really
wd9reH4g--Y36,,,  under energized and our chap on the
wd9reH4g--Y36,,,  right who 's looking a little bit formal
wd9reH4g--Y36,,,  and stiff maybe overcompensating and
wd9reH4g--Y36,,,  then just thinking about the one in the
wd9reH4g--Y36,,,  middle who 's just adjusting nicely and
wd9reH4g--Y37,11.25,11.39,  who is standing in a really comfortable
wd9reH4g--Y37,,,  body posture and softening their neck
wd9reH4g--Y37,,,  and growing towards the ceiling so you
wd9reH4g--Y37,,,  can practice that and you can practice
wd9reH4g--Y37,,,  it with your student and it 's really
wd9reH4g--Y37,,,  worth just observing when people look
wd9reH4g--Y38,11.44,12.06,  comfortable because also it link to how
wd9reH4g--Y38,,,  we feel inside now this is a picture of
wd9reH4g--Y38,,,  a Lee cubby showing a power pose she 's
wd9reH4g--Y38,,,  done a wonderful TED talk called body language
wd9reH4g--Y38,,,and you can go and have a look
wd9reH4g--Y38,,,  at that yourselves but what she 's
wd9reH4g--Y39,12.08,12.18,  talking about she 's a social scientist
wd9reH4g--Y39,,,  and what she 's talking about is the fact
wd9reH4g--Y39,,,  that we know that how we feel affect
wd9reH4g--Y39,,,  what we look like and how we carry
wd9reH4g--Y39,,,  ourselves but they 've done a big study
wd9reH4g--Y39,,,  on the fact that how we physically hold
wd9reH4g--Y40,12.22,12.35,  ourselves and put my arm up in the air
wd9reH4g--Y40,,,  now because that 's a classic power pose
wd9reH4g--Y40,,,  that 's what athlete do when they cross
wd9reH4g--Y40,,,  the line it 's a Vic
wd9reH4g--Y40,,,  suppose that by preparing by habitually
wd9reH4g--Y40,,,  going into strong power pose taking up
wd9reH4g--Y41,12.37,12.51,  a lot of room it radically effect on an
wd9reH4g--Y41,,,  unconscious level our readiness and
wd9reH4g--Y41,,,  confidence and our ability to succeed or
wd9reH4g--Y41,,,  get through interview well we 'll get
wd9reH4g--Y41,,,  through speech and present
wd9reH4g--Y41,,,  presentation well so again that 's
wd9reH4g--Y42,12.54,13.05,  something I 'm going to invite you to try
wd9reH4g--Y42,,,  out for yourself and with your student
wd9reH4g--Y42,,,  is play with confident posture before
wd9reH4g--Y42,,,  you have to speak just get yourself into
wd9reH4g--Y42,,,  some really powerful pose for a while
wd9reH4g--Y42,,,  and see how it make you feel and see if
wd9reH4g--Y43,13.07,13.19,  it make a difference
wd9reH4g--Y43,,,  again just checking in doe everybody
wd9reH4g--Y43,,,  doe that make sense to people just give
wd9reH4g--Y43,,,  me a few yes if it doe fabulous
wd9reH4g--Y43,,,  that 's lovely
wd9reH4g--Y43,,,  okay I 'm disconnect to our breathing in
wd9reH4g--Y44,13.23,13.41,  term of presentation and calm and mind
wd9reH4g--Y44,,,  management and voice control breathing
wd9reH4g--Y44,,,  is really key now you may well be very
wd9reH4g--Y44,,,  familiar with breathing exercise
wd9reH4g--Y44,,,  already but very briefly I just want you
wd9reH4g--Y44,,,  to think about your own breath and
wd9reH4g--Y45,13.45,14.03,  encouraging your breath to drop really
wd9reH4g--Y45,,,  deeply into your body and so now
wd9reH4g--Y45,,,  everybody just let 's let 's all put a
wd9reH4g--Y45,,,  hand just below your sternum maybe just
wd9reH4g--Y45,,,  above your waist where there 's lot of
wd9reH4g--Y45,,,  moving to the belly and on your lower
wd9reH4g--Y46,14.05,14.19,  rib yes drinking water is very
wd9reH4g--Y46,,,  important to thank you for that and just
wd9reH4g--Y46,,,  to experience relaxing and letting your
wd9reH4g--Y46,,,  breath drop really easily not a big
wd9reH4g--Y46,,,  force to top up breath because that is a
wd9reH4g--Y46,,,  fight reaction but a nice
wd9reH4g--Y47,14.23,14.35,  energy relaxed breath really seep into
wd9reH4g--Y47,,,  your body just feel it going to where
wd9reH4g--Y47,,,  your hand are if somebody 's already
wd9reH4g--Y47,,,  done philosophy today perfect I did n't
wd9reH4g--Y47,,,  have time but I will later and then
wd9reH4g--Y47,,,  feeling the breath leave the body and
wd9reH4g--Y48,14.37,14.55,  being aware of all those support muscle
wd9reH4g--Y48,,,  that are helping
wd9reH4g--Y48,,,  the breath to be controlled and strong
wd9reH4g--Y48,,,  and consistent empowering the voice yeah
wd9reH4g--Y48,,,  and I think I saw somebody say and smile
wd9reH4g--Y48,,,  indeed so of course our face and the
wd9reH4g--Y49,15,15.12,  muscle in the face and the throat are
wd9reH4g--Y49,,,  also very much connected to not only how
wd9reH4g--Y49,,,  people feel about u emotionally but
wd9reH4g--Y49,,,  also connected to the quality of our
wd9reH4g--Y49,,,  voice so in smiling and releasing the
wd9reH4g--Y49,,,  muscle in allowing u we also brighten
wd9reH4g--Y50,15.14,15.26,  up the voice and allows the voice to be
wd9reH4g--Y50,,,  more resoce and that 's a whole other
wd9reH4g--Y50,,,  piece of work we 've made to talk about
wd9reH4g--Y50,,,  another time so relax release the breath
wd9reH4g--Y50,,,  use the torso muscle to support the
wd9reH4g--Y50,,,  voice and smile and remember that that
wd9reH4g--Y51,15.31,15.45,  it 's much easier to show warmth in the
wd9reH4g--Y51,,,  face of the voice when we 're relaxed
wd9reH4g--Y51,,,  it 's quite hard if we 're very tense so
wd9reH4g--Y51,,,  practice those facial muscle relaxing
wd9reH4g--Y51,,,  and the body relaxing and being alert
wd9reH4g--Y51,,,  okay anybody ha any question just
wd9reH4g--Y52,15.49,16.06,  please send them in our direction
wd9reH4g--Y52,,,  okay so clarity and variety I think you
wd9reH4g--Y52,,,  guy are probably pretty much expert on
wd9reH4g--Y52,,,  clarity already but let 's just think
wd9reH4g--Y52,,,  about what these two thing might be how
wd9reH4g--Y52,,,  we might most usefully think about those
wd9reH4g--Y53,16.07,16.22,  in this context so in term of clarity
wd9reH4g--Y53,,,  my take on listening to many many many
wd9reH4g--Y53,,,  people doing presentation is what they
wd9reH4g--Y53,,,  tend to lose is the end of word and
wd9reH4g--Y53,,,  the middle consot so I would very
wd9reH4g--Y53,,,  much encourage you to be listening for
wd9reH4g--Y54,16.23,16.36,  those I 'm sure you do already but end
wd9reH4g--Y54,,,  of word the middle continent and where
wd9reH4g--Y54,,,  we live and where we 're going to live
wd9reH4g--Y54,,,  word in term of clarity and one thing
wd9reH4g--Y54,,,  that I do a lot with my student is to
wd9reH4g--Y54,,,  get them to over enunciate speech and
wd9reH4g--Y55,16.4,16.5,  text and their own material in their
wd9reH4g--Y55,,,  speech before they come back to
wd9reH4g--Y55,,,  speaking normally just to really get
wd9reH4g--Y55,,,  those muscle working and exaggerate the
wd9reH4g--Y55,,,  vowel
wd9reH4g--Y55,,,  isolate the consot play with those
wd9reH4g--Y56,16.53,17.05,  isolate the vowel play with those to
wd9reH4g--Y56,,,  get more space in
wd9reH4g--Y56,,,  to the mouth and we 'll look at a piece
wd9reH4g--Y56,,,  of text in just a moment and what we
wd9reH4g--Y56,,,  might want to do with that in term of
wd9reH4g--Y56,,,  practice variety we all know that one of
wd9reH4g--Y57,17.09,17.21,  the thing that people ca n't bear is
wd9reH4g--Y57,,,  monotonous voice so how do we get music
wd9reH4g--Y57,,,  into our voice well obviously we can
wd9reH4g--Y57,,,  play with pitch we can play with
wd9reH4g--Y57,,,  emphasis and punctuation we can play
wd9reH4g--Y57,,,  with different pacing within the
wd9reH4g--Y58,17.26,17.41,  phrasing and it is just how to define
wd9reH4g--Y58,,,  content everything okay we 'll talk about
wd9reH4g--Y58,,,  eye contact and at the end for soon
wd9reH4g--Y58,,,  thank you we 'll hold that thought
wd9reH4g--Y58,,,  so I 've just got this extract from
wd9reH4g--Y58,,,  Martin Luther King 's I have a dream
wd9reH4g--Y59,17.43,17.55,  speech here and if we were practicing on
wd9reH4g--Y59,,,  this and other text I would invite you
wd9reH4g--Y59,,,  to look at which of the important word
wd9reH4g--Y59,,,  in every in the phrase which of the
wd9reH4g--Y59,,,  phrase that need more emphasis
wd9reH4g--Y59,,,  how do those have that repetition play
wd9reH4g--Y60,17.59,18.11,  into not only the wonderful construction
wd9reH4g--Y60,,,  of the speech but how do you register I
wd9reH4g--Y60,,,  have a dream differently the second time
wd9reH4g--Y60,,,  from the first time and then the third
wd9reH4g--Y60,,,  time from the second time and the fourth
wd9reH4g--Y60,,,  time from the third time what are
wd9reH4g--Y61,18.13,18.29,  different image in there that your
wd9reH4g--Y61,,,  voice reflects with different color and
wd9reH4g--Y61,,,  tone and energy and when you when you
wd9reH4g--Y61,,,  can see the picture that he 's
wd9reH4g--Y61,,,  describing what doe that do to your
wd9reH4g--Y61,,,  storytelling to them to your vocal
wd9reH4g--Y62,18.31,18.47,  quality and how do you get those
wd9reH4g--Y62,,,  different emotion across with your
wd9reH4g--Y62,,,  voice hope fear sadness joy I would
wd9reH4g--Y62,,,  really encourage you to take text very
wd9reH4g--Y62,,,  different text apart bit by bit and
wd9reH4g--Y62,,,  play with them play with them with all
wd9reH4g--Y63,18.5,19.01,  kind of different information and
wd9reH4g--Y63,,,  stress emphasis and have fun
wd9reH4g--Y63,,,  and of course child 's story are
wd9reH4g--Y63,,,  perfect for this a well because then we
wd9reH4g--Y63,,,  can do the voice and we can do the
wd9reH4g--Y63,,,  different character but really focus on
wd9reH4g--Y64,19.04,19.17,  how much color can I put into my voice
wd9reH4g--Y64,,,  so that it feel natural and authentic
wd9reH4g--Y64,,,  and not overplayed but so that the
wd9reH4g--Y64,,,  muscle are really working quite hard
wd9reH4g--Y64,,,  most of u use very little range
wd9reH4g--Y64,,,  compared to what is available to u so
wd9reH4g--Y65,19.22,19.35,  at this point if we 're thinking about
wd9reH4g--Y65,,,  people who do it really well I 'm going
wd9reH4g--Y65,,,  to invite you just to throw in some
wd9reH4g--Y65,,,  idea about who you think are wonderful
wd9reH4g--Y65,,,  speaker and what it is that 's wonderful
wd9reH4g--Y65,,,  about them what are they doing that is
wd9reH4g--Y66,19.37,19.58,  so special it 's just quick and quick
wd9reH4g--Y66,,,  response here yeah we 've got anybody
wd9reH4g--Y66,,,  coming back on that who doe it

wd9reH4g--Y68,,,  about so far and anything else that
wd9reH4g--Y68,,,  you 've already thought about them
wd9reH4g--Y68,,,  what 's great about those people is yet
wd9reH4g--Y68,,,  their content is it their delivery is it
wd9reH4g--Y68,,,  their attitude okay we 'll pick up on
wd9reH4g--Y69,20.37,20.5,  some of these because I 'm not seeing
wd9reH4g--Y69,,,  anything come back just yet in a little
wd9reH4g--Y69,,,  while let 's come back to those at the
wd9reH4g--Y69,,,  end great so we 've been thinking about
wd9reH4g--Y69,,,  element of delivery and now I want to
wd9reH4g--Y69,,,  think briefly about element of content
wd9reH4g--Y70,20.53,21.09,  so we know that human being need the
wd9reH4g--Y70,,,  element of the argument that is logical
wd9reH4g--Y70,,,  and and coherence and ha a narrative
wd9reH4g--Y70,,,  and we also need anecdote and feeling
wd9reH4g--Y70,,,  and story and in
wd9reH4g--Y70,,,  both of these really have to be there in
wd9reH4g--Y71,21.12,21.27,  our content okay so the fact we talked
wd9reH4g--Y71,,,  about narrative strand is prison the
wd9reH4g--Y71,,,  storytelling webinar I invite you if you
wd9reH4g--Y71,,,  were n't there to go and have a look at
wd9reH4g--Y71,,,  it on the website and so what are my key
wd9reH4g--Y71,,,  message what are the key message the
wd9reH4g--Y72,21.3,21.44,  chapter that lead towards the purpose
wd9reH4g--Y72,,,  the objective but I want to get to what
wd9reH4g--Y72,,,  kind of evidence do I need to back it up
wd9reH4g--Y72,,,  what make me look credible in that
wd9reH4g--Y72,,,  sense of being logical and knowledgeable
wd9reH4g--Y72,,,  and then what is going to make the
wd9reH4g--Y73,21.47,22,  audience come on board from an emotional
wd9reH4g--Y73,,,  point of view what are these human
wd9reH4g--Y73,,,  story that I can tell that make this
wd9reH4g--Y73,,,  meaningful and relevance and specific to
wd9reH4g--Y73,,,  the audience those are my question now
wd9reH4g--Y73,,,  one way of exploring this and this is
wd9reH4g--Y74,22.03,22.14,  something I mentioned last time a really
wd9reH4g--Y74,,,  simple activity again maybe for your
wd9reH4g--Y74,,,  student is to think about the fact if
wd9reH4g--Y74,,,  you were describing a journey that you
wd9reH4g--Y74,,,  take whatever fact that your audience
wd9reH4g--Y74,,,  need to understand how to undertake
wd9reH4g--Y75,22.17,22.32,  that journey themselves okay so top top
wd9reH4g--Y75,,,  your pair partner through it and see if
wd9reH4g--Y75,,,  they can picture that journey from A to
wd9reH4g--Y75,,,  Z knowing how they 'd undertake it
wd9reH4g--Y75,,,  themselves and get safely to their
wd9reH4g--Y75,,,  destination and then pare down those
wd9reH4g--Y76,22.35,22.48,  instruction to the fewest possible the
wd9reH4g--Y76,,,  key message what are the chapter
wd9reH4g--Y76,,,  heading then what are the what are the
wd9reH4g--Y76,,,  key moment that they still need to
wd9reH4g--Y76,,,  understand to get them to their
wd9reH4g--Y76,,,  destination now we add in the
wd9reH4g--Y77,22.53,23.07,  interesting feature that they might
wd9reH4g--Y77,,,  experience along the way maybe a
wd9reH4g--Y77,,,  wonderful building or an interesting
wd9reH4g--Y77,,,  person or a tree or a lovely pavement or
wd9reH4g--Y77,,,  a beautiful anything that is going to
wd9reH4g--Y77,,,  spark their imagination that make them
wd9reH4g--Y78,23.09,23.25,  want to undertake that journey what is
wd9reH4g--Y78,,,  wonderful and interesting about this
wd9reH4g--Y78,,,  journey those are the heart moment
wd9reH4g--Y78,,,  those are the
wd9reH4g--Y78,,,  color element in your story and we need
wd9reH4g--Y78,,,  color we need to bring this to life this
wd9reH4g--Y79,23.29,23.51,  message to life with something that is
wd9reH4g--Y79,,,  not only relevant but colorful visual
wd9reH4g--Y79,,,  exciting intriguing so we start with the
wd9reH4g--Y79,,,  purpose we establish our chapter and we
wd9reH4g--Y79,,,  add color to each chapter along the way
wd9reH4g--Y79,,,  and this is a summary of one way of
wd9reH4g--Y80,23.55,24.09,  thinking about how to construct an
wd9reH4g--Y80,,,  outline so in the beginning section good
wd9reH4g--Y80,,,  idea to grab the audience 's attention a
wd9reH4g--Y80,,,  we know they do n't remember very much
wd9reH4g--Y80,,,  and they 're much more likely to listen
wd9reH4g--Y80,,,  carefully if you say something that is
wd9reH4g--Y81,24.12,24.24,  meaningful to them right at the
wd9reH4g--Y81,,,  beginning something surprising something
wd9reH4g--Y81,,,  intriguing something exciting sell the
wd9reH4g--Y81,,,  benefit to them really early on if you
wd9reH4g--Y81,,,  want to establish your credential right
wd9reH4g--Y81,,,  at the beginning that 's fine but I would
wd9reH4g--Y82,24.25,24.38,  do it after the attention and
wd9reH4g--Y82,,,  the benefit and your credential are
wd9reH4g--Y82,,,  what give you the right to talk you
wd9reH4g--Y82,,,  do n't have to have a PhD in the topic
wd9reH4g--Y82,,,  but you do have to care about it very
wd9reH4g--Y82,,,  much and if you want to you might tell
wd9reH4g--Y83,24.42,24.52,  them how you 're going to approach the
wd9reH4g--Y83,,,  topic if you want to you need to be
wd9reH4g--Y83,,,  clear about your key message in the
wd9reH4g--Y83,,,  middle the chapter heading you need to
wd9reH4g--Y83,,,  be clear about keeping their attention
wd9reH4g--Y83,,,  with color and we really need a summary
wd9reH4g--Y84,24.56,25.14,  and the conclusion at the end because we
wd9reH4g--Y84,,,  find it hard to remember thing so make
wd9reH4g--Y84,,,  it a easy a you possibly can for u
wd9reH4g--Y84,,,  and help u to remember your most
wd9reH4g--Y84,,,  important message a you a you conclude
wd9reH4g--Y84,,,  okay
wd9reH4g--Y85,25.18,25.35,  one more checklist for you thinking
wd9reH4g--Y85,,,  about head and heart I 've got something
wd9reH4g--Y85,,,  that I find really useful here so on the
wd9reH4g--Y85,,,  head side we 've got that 's the top row
wd9reH4g--Y85,,,  hard fact and data check so the people
wd9reH4g--Y85,,,  who want expertise in the audience that
wd9reH4g--Y86,25.36,25.49,  you 've got some hard fact and data in
wd9reH4g--Y86,,,  there check for the people who want to
wd9reH4g--Y86,,,  know what they have to do and like to
wd9reH4g--Y86,,,  see action and purpose check that your
wd9reH4g--Y86,,,  purpose is really clear and that people
wd9reH4g--Y86,,,  know which action are required on the
wd9reH4g--Y87,25.53,26.04,  lower level understanding of the
wd9reH4g--Y87,,,  audience demonstrates that you 've
wd9reH4g--Y87,,,  stepped into their shoe China some way
wd9reH4g--Y87,,,  of showing that you 've thought about
wd9reH4g--Y87,,,  their concern but if they need
wd9reH4g--Y87,,,  reassurance you can be assure them if
wd9reH4g--Y88,26.07,26.18,  there are feeling they might be
wd9reH4g--Y88,,,  experiencing in relation to the topic
wd9reH4g--Y88,,,  reference them and down on the bottom
wd9reH4g--Y88,,,  right imagination what are the anecdote
wd9reH4g--Y88,,,  what are the image that bring this
wd9reH4g--Y88,,,  material and this topic and these
wd9reH4g--Y89,26.21,26.39,  message really vividly to life search
wd9reH4g--Y89,,,  the story search for picture and
wd9reH4g--Y89,,,  though the word in that corner is
wd9reH4g--Y89,,,  imagine if ok and then and and how you
wd9reH4g--Y89,,,  scatter those through your presentation
wd9reH4g--Y89,,,  how you you might use them a individual
wd9reH4g--Y90,26.42,26.56,  chapter will obviously depend on the
wd9reH4g--Y90,,,  audience and the message and the
wd9reH4g--Y90,,,  context ok so finally this look a bit
wd9reH4g--Y90,,,  like an activity that we referenced last
wd9reH4g--Y90,,,  time
wd9reH4g--Y90,,,  it 's another lovely activity your
wd9reH4g--Y91,26.58,27.14,  student is in pair when they 've got
wd9reH4g--Y91,,,  their material ready is to one of them
wd9reH4g--Y91,,,  if the speaker and the other one either
wd9reH4g--Y91,,,  say tell me more if they need more
wd9reH4g--Y91,,,  color at that point or move on if they
wd9reH4g--Y91,,,  want to hear some more of the story the
wd9reH4g--Y92,27.18,27.31,  narrative the fact and that you can you
wd9reH4g--Y92,,,  can play with that a a co coaching
wd9reH4g--Y92,,,  exercise so you 're either saying okay
wd9reH4g--Y92,,,  move on I 've got it or no tell me more
wd9reH4g--Y92,,,  to encourage them to
wd9reH4g--Y92,,,  to put in more description and color and
wd9reH4g--Y93,27.35,27.49,  so really it really tell you so much
wd9reH4g--Y93,,,  about your material and when people say
wd9reH4g--Y93,,,  to tell me more it tends to bring u to
wd9reH4g--Y93,,,  life so our delivery tends to be a
wd9reH4g--Y93,,,  little bit more vivid and colorful and
wd9reH4g--Y93,,,  expressive so those wow that 's our
wd9reH4g--Y94,27.53,28.08,  half that 's fantastic
wd9reH4g--Y94,,,  um so ha anybody got any more response
wd9reH4g--Y94,,,  to the idea what do we think wonderful
wd9reH4g--Y94,,,  look like we will be a little bit more
wd9reH4g--Y94,,,  specific about what it is that those
wd9reH4g--Y94,,,  speaker that you 've referenced do
wd9reH4g--Y95,28.1,28.27,  really well storytelling yeah thank you
wd9reH4g--Y95,,,  thank you Mary Anna pacing sometimes yes
wd9reH4g--Y95,,,  pacing variety absolutely yet their
wd9reH4g--Y95,,,  personality come through it 's clear
wd9reH4g--Y95,,,  okay there 's a questionnaire for me
wd9reH4g--Y95,,,  sherry just so told it how can you apply
wd9reH4g--Y96,28.28,28.44,  this to boring topic like ficial
wd9reH4g--Y96,,,  report and presentation so the answer
wd9reH4g--Y96,,,  to that is apply that I 'm going to go
wd9reH4g--Y96,,,  back apply this slide here you know with
wd9reH4g--Y96,,,  those sort of boring presentation what
wd9reH4g--Y96,,,  the hard fact and data is but what is
wd9reH4g--Y97,28.46,29.03,  the purpose of of conveying them to the
wd9reH4g--Y97,,,  audience so there is always either a
wd9reH4g--Y97,,,  metaphor or a personal story that
wd9reH4g--Y97,,,  illustrates the benefit of this data
wd9reH4g--Y97,,,  this this purpose set for the audience
wd9reH4g--Y97,,,  and and go back to story spine go back
wd9reH4g--Y98,29.09,29.19,  to do n't have a look at the storytelling
wd9reH4g--Y98,,,  webinar and I think that if you were n't
wd9reH4g--Y98,,,  there I think that will give you some
wd9reH4g--Y98,,,  idea apply the story spine to your
wd9reH4g--Y98,,,  topic find out for yourself what the
wd9reH4g--Y98,,,  story is okay anything else roleplay
wd9reH4g--Y99,29.24,29.38,  what doe that mean
wd9reH4g--Y99,,,  okay interactive speech not Mormon yes
wd9reH4g--Y99,,,  this is all about creating relationship
wd9reH4g--Y99,,,  so of course you can actually create
wd9reH4g--Y99,,,  interaction with your audience you can
wd9reH4g--Y99,,,  ask them question you can ask them to
wd9reH4g--Y100,29.4,29.55,  think about thing or you can imagine
wd9reH4g--Y100,,,  that it 's a conversation all of the way
wd9reH4g--Y100,,,  through eye contact yes thank you for
wd9reH4g--Y100,,,  reminding me I contact the important
wd9reH4g--Y100,,,  thing with eye contact is of course 
wd9reH4g--Y100,,,  what if the audience is not interested
wd9reH4g--Y101,29.56,30.11,  in the top of the tool well maybe they
wd9reH4g--Y101,,,  should n't be there and they will come
wd9reH4g--Y101,,,  back that eye contact so the most
wd9reH4g--Y101,,,  important thing with eye contact is to
wd9reH4g--Y101,,,  make people really feel seen so I
wd9reH4g--Y101,,,  contact is actually a very natural
wd9reH4g--Y102,30.14,30.26,  activity sometimes I think the easiest
wd9reH4g--Y102,,,  thing to think about is that you 're
wd9reH4g--Y102,,,  facilitating the audience forget that
wd9reH4g--Y102,,,  you 're the speaker think about the fact
wd9reH4g--Y102,,,  that you 're looking after them
wd9reH4g--Y102,,,  you are a somebody ha just said thank
wd9reH4g--Y103,30.28,30.42,  you finding common ground with them so
wd9reH4g--Y103,,,  you do that through empathizing with
wd9reH4g--Y103,,,  them  imagining what they need in term
wd9reH4g--Y103,,,  of of the material but you also make
wd9reH4g--Y103,,,  sure that you really see them and you 're
wd9reH4g--Y103,,,  really talking to them and there are all
wd9reH4g--Y104,30.46,31,  kind of technique you can use but
wd9reH4g--Y104,,,  actually the most important thing to me
wd9reH4g--Y104,,,  is that you slow down and that you
wd9reH4g--Y104,,,  really really look at people when you 're
wd9reH4g--Y104,,,  speaking and you can include a lot of
wd9reH4g--Y104,,,  people if you have a large audience in
wd9reH4g--Y105,31.02,31.16,  your peripheral eye contact but do n't
wd9reH4g--Y105,,,  fake it or it becomes like a tennis
wd9reH4g--Y105,,,  match now just really really speak to
wd9reH4g--Y105,,,  them and your eye contact will work
wd9reH4g--Y105,,,  anything else
wd9reH4g--Y105,,,  Han River yeah and the biggest gift you
wd9reH4g--Y106,31.19,31.3,  can give to yourself in term of your
wd9reH4g--Y106,,,  gesture is to relax your arm and hand
wd9reH4g--Y106,,,  and then they will help you the more you
wd9reH4g--Y106,,,  relax the more you really imagine what
wd9reH4g--Y106,,,  you 're talking about
wd9reH4g--Y106,,,  the more your gesture will automatically
wd9reH4g--Y107,31.32,31.45,  reflect what you 're trying to say and
wd9reH4g--Y107,,,  the move that you 're trying to create
wd9reH4g--Y107,,,  usually what get in the way of natural
wd9reH4g--Y107,,,  gesture is tension and awkwardness
wd9reH4g--Y107,,,  habit so while you 're practicing your
wd9reH4g--Y107,,,  posture and your alignment and your
wd9reH4g--Y108,31.47,32,  relax relaxation include your arm in
wd9reH4g--Y108,,,  your hand in that allow them just to
wd9reH4g--Y108,,,  rest by your side until it 's time for
wd9reH4g--Y108,,,  them to come to life but try to avoid
wd9reH4g--Y108,,,  the need to clasp them in front of your
wd9reH4g--Y108,,,  body or behind your body there anything
wd9reH4g--Y109,32.04,32.12,  else anybody want to know yes
wd9reH4g--Y109,,,  absolutely involved in with you Carol
wd9reH4g--Y109,,,  what would you suggest to the presenter
wd9reH4g--Y109,,,  about asking their audience to put in a
wd9reH4g--Y109,,,  short feedback form to their future
wd9reH4g--Y109,,,  improvement who I 'm wondering what do
wd9reH4g--Y110,32.16,32.3,  you mean  the by busy presenter I mean
wd9reH4g--Y110,,,  I would always I would always have a
wd9reH4g--Y110,,,  mental feedback form for yourself
wd9reH4g--Y110,,,  and if you 're talking about your
wd9reH4g--Y110,,,  student yeah for sure I have a
wd9reH4g--Y110,,,  checklist about how connected they felt
wd9reH4g--Y111,32.32,32.42,  to the material and how how they felt
wd9reH4g--Y111,,,  their pacing went and how they thought
wd9reH4g--Y111,,,  they were expressive in body language
wd9reH4g--Y111,,,  I 'm not sure if that answer your
wd9reH4g--Y111,,,  question
wd9reH4g--Y111,,,  sure other audience question with we 've
wd9reH4g--Y112,32.44,33.01,  mentioned that and great lovely how do
wd9reH4g--Y112,,,  we get your PowerPoint slide we 've not
wd9reH4g--Y112,,,  having enough time to make all necessary
wd9reH4g--Y112,,,  screen shot I 'm going to hand that
wd9reH4g--Y112,,,  question back to Henry anything
wd9reH4g--Y112,,,  technical up Thank You Henry they will
wd9reH4g--Y113,33.04,33.19,  be available fantastic do not read
wd9reH4g--Y113,,,  script never read script
wd9reH4g--Y113,,,  never you 're so right okay on note and
wd9reH4g--Y113,,,  prompt please do not use your
wd9reH4g--Y113,,,  PowerPoint slide a prompt please know
wd9reH4g--Y113,,,  your story so that for the most part all
wd9reH4g--Y114,33.22,33.37,  you need are small two
wd9reH4g--Y114,,,  I would ask you unless you absolutely
wd9reH4g--Y114,,,  have to please never have to read a
wd9reH4g--Y114,,,  script but do have any quote that you
wd9reH4g--Y114,,,  want to get perfectly right in front of
wd9reH4g--Y114,,,  you maybe on a small card any using find
wd9reH4g--Y115,33.41,33.54,  way of prompting yourself in any way
wd9reH4g--Y115,,,  that you need to but do n't have too many
wd9reH4g--Y115,,,  should you learn your story by heart
wd9reH4g--Y115,,,  know you should know your story what is
wd9reH4g--Y115,,,  the story behind what you 're saying
wd9reH4g--Y115,,,  if so if you do have something you want
wd9reH4g--Y116,34.01,34.15,  to get completely WordPerfect then yes
wd9reH4g--Y116,,,  learn it or have it written down if you
wd9reH4g--Y116,,,  really need to but but otherwise if you
wd9reH4g--Y116,,,  really understand you 'll be giving your
wd9reH4g--Y116,,,  middle and an end you should n't need too
wd9reH4g--Y116,,,  many prompt somebody said should you
wd9reH4g--Y117,34.2,34.36,  leave question until the end um I I
wd9reH4g--Y117,,,  think it really depends on how urgent
wd9reH4g--Y117,,,  the question are but if you whatever
wd9reH4g--Y117,,,  stage you choose to take question and I
wd9reH4g--Y117,,,  would try and control that because
wd9reH4g--Y117,,,  otherwise you can have people really
wd9reH4g--Y118,34.38,34.5,  interrupting your flow all the way
wd9reH4g--Y118,,,  through come back to your conclusion
wd9reH4g--Y118,,,  after you 've taken QA because we want
wd9reH4g--Y118,,,  you to have the last word and we want
wd9reH4g--Y118,,,  your key message to be the last thing
wd9reH4g--Y118,,,  people remember so take Q & A whenever you
wd9reH4g--Y119,34.54,35.11,  think it 's most appropriate but have
wd9reH4g--Y119,,,  another summary afterwards any tip for
wd9reH4g--Y119,,,  quick preparation before a speech my
wd9reH4g--Y119,,,  quickest tip would be use this checklist
wd9reH4g--Y119,,,  that I decide I still got up I agree I
wd9reH4g--Y119,,,  think you should rehearse I think if you
wd9reH4g--Y120,35.13,35.25,  possibly can people avoid rehearsal
wd9reH4g--Y120,,,  because it make them uncomfortable but
wd9reH4g--Y120,,,  I do n't think anybody is a better
wd9reH4g--Y120,,,  speaker without any any rehearsal and
wd9reH4g--Y120,,,  practice practice practice
wd9reH4g--Y120,,,  absolutely and practice with a partner
wd9reH4g--Y121,35.29,35.44,  a well get them to give you feedback
wd9reH4g--Y121,,,  try the moving on or tell me more
wd9reH4g--Y121,,,  exercise get them to tell you what they
wd9reH4g--Y121,,,  remember it might not be what you expect
wd9reH4g--Y121,,,  get them to tell you the feeling that
wd9reH4g--Y121,,,  the experience you were speaking that
wd9reH4g--Y122,35.45,35.59,  might not not be what you expect and in
wd9reH4g--Y122,,,  term of building confidence oh yeah can
wd9reH4g--Y122,,,  you repeat the essence of tell me one
wd9reH4g--Y122,,,  more thing pick you up let 's get back
wd9reH4g--Y122,,,  for that slide so you 've got your
wd9reH4g--Y122,,,  presentation material and actually you
wd9reH4g--Y123,36.01,36.12,  can do this exercise at any stage when
wd9reH4g--Y123,,,  it
wd9reH4g--Y123,,,  it went when you 're at the beginning of
wd9reH4g--Y123,,,  constructing it all where do you think
wd9reH4g--Y123,,,  it 's pretty much fully formed and with a
wd9reH4g--Y123,,,  partner or partner start to deliver
wd9reH4g--Y124,36.17,36.34,  your presentation and when they want a
wd9reH4g--Y124,,,  little bit more color or detail all they
wd9reH4g--Y124,,,  do is say tell me more and this flesh is
wd9reH4g--Y124,,,  out the story that you 're telling or
wd9reH4g--Y124,,,  the description that you 're giving them

wd9reH4g--Y125,36.38,36.5,  character that 's relevant to your topic
wd9reH4g--Y125,,,  and they want to know more they want to

wd9reH4g--Y125,,,  to know how they talk they want to
wd9reH4g--Y125,,,  experience their behavior that 's true

ISn4Fip9aH81,0,0.2,  The first moment of presentation are critical .
ISn4Fip9aH81,,,  Let 's look at the five best way to open .
ISn4Fip9aH81,,,  My name is Alex Lyon and I 'm here to
ISn4Fip9aH81,,,  provide professional development tip for your very next meeting . Today we 're
ISn4Fip9aH81,,,  going to talk about presentation skill . And it 's a critical area for leader
ISn4Fip9aH81,,,  because people will often see someone present and if you do well they 'll think
ISn4Fip9aH82,0.24,0.41,  oh that person is a good leader .
ISn4Fip9aH82,,,  That 's the way people translate it . And the first moment of presentation are
ISn4Fip9aH82,,,  really key it 's that attention getter
ISn4Fip9aH82,,,  is what they call it that moment your grab your audience 's attention and you draw
ISn4Fip9aH82,,,  their interest in to the heart of the message you 're about to share . And there
ISn4Fip9aH82,,,  are some good way to start and some bad way . We 're going to look at the top 5 way to start
ISn4Fip9aH83,0.45,1.06,  presentation . For the first is a story . And I mean a brief story like 30 second
ISn4Fip9aH83,,,  to 60 second .
ISn4Fip9aH83,,,  It can be humorous . It can be fun light could be serious .
ISn4Fip9aH83,,,  Whatever match the tone of the central message you 're about to share is appropriate
ISn4Fip9aH83,,,  And it also should in it content drive towards the heart of the message . For
ISn4Fip9aH83,,,  example my pastor the other day told the story about how when he wa
ISn4Fip9aH84,1.09,1.31,  young he wa driving this truck on the freeway . It wa a cherry picker huge truck with
ISn4Fip9aH84,,,  the company logo on the side . And he missed his turn and so we had to swerve
ISn4Fip9aH84,,,  over the grass median . And it wa a humorous story but it drove right to the
ISn4Fip9aH84,,,  point wa trying to make which is about difficult choice .
ISn4Fip9aH84,,,  So it worked really well . So a good story a brief story is a strong way to start
ISn4Fip9aH84,,,  your presentation . Second way is a statistic or fact .
ISn4Fip9aH85,1.36,1.56,  Ideally a statistic that 's startling something a little unexpected . Like I
ISn4Fip9aH85,,,  heard one the other day when learning about personal fice and that is
ISn4Fip9aH85,,,  during college student have about eight hundred dollar worth of credit card
ISn4Fip9aH85,,,  debt but by the time they are in the working world they have about eight
ISn4Fip9aH85,,,  thousand dollar worth of credit card debt . Now to me that 's pretty startling .
ISn4Fip9aH85,,,  And if you were going to open a presentation about personal fice or
ISn4Fip9aH86,1.59,2.18,  perhaps college student whatever the topic is that is an example of a good
ISn4Fip9aH86,,,  statistic because it really draw your attention to the issue .
ISn4Fip9aH86,,,  So a you 're doing your research you 'll probably come across some
ISn4Fip9aH86,,,  interesting fact and you should consider some of those a introductory
ISn4Fip9aH86,,,  or attention material for your opening . The third way is rhetorical question .
ISn4Fip9aH86,,,  A rhetorical question a they say is not necessarily a question that need to be
ISn4Fip9aH87,2.22,2.4,  answered .
ISn4Fip9aH87,,,  However you could ask your listener to raise their hand if that they have ever
ISn4Fip9aH87,,,  thought that . For example say by show of hand how many of you have ever
ISn4Fip9aH87,,,  and then you insert your question . I think it 's a great way to start because
ISn4Fip9aH87,,,  it instantly get your audience participating and bought in on board
ISn4Fip9aH87,,,  with the message you 're sharing .
ISn4Fip9aH88,2.41,2.59,  I think it 's also best to structure this so you asked two possibly three
ISn4Fip9aH88,,,  question in a row so it add a little momentum to the message . And that way
ISn4Fip9aH88,,,  it 's not just a one kind of question
ISn4Fip9aH88,,,  it 's something that draw them that draw them in . The fourth way to open is
ISn4Fip9aH88,,,  an illustration .
ISn4Fip9aH88,,,  You should consider something visual that show your audience
ISn4Fip9aH89,3.03,3.21,  the point that you 're trying to make . I once saw a speaker for example lineup
ISn4Fip9aH89,,,  stack of cooky to illustrate difference in number .
ISn4Fip9aH89,,,  Now cooky are much more interesting to look at than just a number . So it 's a
ISn4Fip9aH89,,,  great visual representation .
ISn4Fip9aH89,,,  Sometimes people will use an object a a representation a visual
ISn4Fip9aH89,,,  illustration of what they 're trying to get across . Any way you can do that maybe
ISn4Fip9aH810,3.25,3.43,  a visual aid even something on the screen could be a powerful way to start
ISn4Fip9aH810,,,  something that help the visual learner in your audience to get on board with
ISn4Fip9aH810,,,  what you 're about to say can be a really great way to start . And the last way is
ISn4Fip9aH810,,,  quotation .
ISn4Fip9aH810,,,  Now you can start with it a well quotation but I do n't think the
ISn4Fip9aH810,,,  well quotation are always best .
ISn4Fip9aH811,3.46,4.06,  It 's true the Abraham Lincoln
ISn4Fip9aH811,,,  and Einstein they all said some amazing thing but the problem with using a
ISn4Fip9aH811,,,  common quotation is that people have probably already heard it . And it might
ISn4Fip9aH811,,,  not have the impact that you 're trying to have . I think it 's best if you look
ISn4Fip9aH811,,,  for a unique or off quotation . for example I saw a speaker recently give a
ISn4Fip9aH811,,,  quote from Bruce Lee to begin his presentation . His presentation wa n't
ISn4Fip9aH812,4.11,4.3,  about martial art . It wa about making mistake . And Bruce Lee ha a great
ISn4Fip9aH812,,,  quotation about making mistake and it wa a powerful way to start because I had
ISn4Fip9aH812,,,  never heard it before . But it wa a powerful way to open .
ISn4Fip9aH812,,,  so these are the top five way I recommend starting your presentation . I
ISn4Fip9aH812,,,  want to give you two additional suggestion for using attention getters
ISn4Fip9aH812,,,  effectively . And the first suggestion is to make sure it 's the very first thing
ISn4Fip9aH813,4.34,4.55,  out of your mouth .
ISn4Fip9aH813,,,  a lot of time we get introduced and then we might fill in with a whole bunch
ISn4Fip9aH813,,,  of other thing and then in a moment or two we finally get to our message . But I
ISn4Fip9aH813,,,  think the first thing out of your mouth should be your attention getter .
ISn4Fip9aH813,,,  You might say thank you to the applause or thank you briefly a couple of second
ISn4Fip9aH813,,,  and then you pause and you go into your attention getter . The second
ISn4Fip9aH814,4.58,5.2,  recommendation to using these attention getters I think it 's great to combine
ISn4Fip9aH814,,,  these together . You might use for example a rhetorical question with a statistic or
ISn4Fip9aH814,,,  a quote with a rhetorical question .
ISn4Fip9aH814,,,  you can there 's some art to this but you can weave them together and play around
ISn4Fip9aH814,,,  till you get the right combination . But if you combine more than one then you 're almost
ISn4Fip9aH814,,,  guaranteed to have a powerful opening that really doe n't do the job and gain
ISn4Fip9aH815,5.24,5.38,  people 's attention .
ISn4Fip9aH815,,,  So like I said presentation are often considered a leadership skill and I
ISn4Fip9aH815,,,  highly recommend
ISn4Fip9aH815,,,  developing these every chance you get . And it 's why I created Communication
ISn4Fip9aH815,,,  Coach . I created it to help rising leader like yourself
ISn4Fip9aH815,,,  take your leadership and communication skill to the next level .

ISn4Fip9aH816,,,  conversation about that .

ISn4Fip9aH816,,,  meeting .
2OBewm5guJk1,0,0.21,  I 'm Alex Lyon and you 're about to start a seven mini on Concise
2OBewm5guJk1,,,  Clear and Confident Communication . I put this course together because I believe
2OBewm5guJk1,,,  It 's really the best first step for you in your professional development laying
2OBewm5guJk1,,,  that foundation to develop strong communication skill . Moving forward I
2OBewm5guJk1,,,  encourage you to watch all seven lesson .
2OBewm5guJk1,,,  There 's a little practice involved in each one so you can actually hear and
2OBewm5guJk2,0.24,0.53,  then try the idea out . Let 's jump right into the first lesson .
2OBewm5guJk2,,,  In lesson one we 're going after long . I encourage you to watch this and go
2OBewm5guJk2,,,  through a many time a you need to to make this material a habit . Tip one . Long
2OBewm5guJk2,,,  windedness is a key enemy of good communication . I 'm always surprised that
2OBewm5guJk2,,,  really talkative people assume that they 're good communicator . But more
2OBewm5guJk2,,,  talking doe not equal good communication . In fact a lot of time if
2OBewm5guJk3,0.58,1.17,  these word  gabby chatty verbose and talkative  accurately describe you
2OBewm5guJk3,,,  it 's probably forming a bad impression . Especially in professional setting
2OBewm5guJk3,,,  Alison Green said it like this . You might think well some people long winded but
2OBewm5guJk3,,,  it doe n't mean he would n't do a good job .
2OBewm5guJk3,,,  The problem is that a minimum is signal that you 're not good at picking up on
2OBewm5guJk3,,,  conversational cue and it raise doubt about your ability to organize your
2OBewm5guJk4,1.21,1.45,  thought and can convey needed information quickly . So strategy one resolve why you
2OBewm5guJk4,,,  sometimes talk too much . When do you find yourself multiplying word being overly
2OBewm5guJk4,,,  talkative ? Is it just at work or is it social situation ? And what are your in
2OBewm5guJk4,,,  the thought process that trigger it ?
2OBewm5guJk4,,,  Are you insecure about something ? What 's going on in your mind that 's driving
2OBewm5guJk4,,,  that over talkative habit ? Because all the tip in the world will not undo an
2OBewm5guJk5,1.5,2.09,  unspoken belief that drive that long . So excessive
2OBewm5guJk5,,,  talkativeness is rooted in our unspoken belief
2OBewm5guJk5,,,  let 's say you 're a physician and you 're thinking to yourself maybe you do n't
2OBewm5guJk5,,,  realize it but you 're thinking I want people to know I 'm smart . You will most
2OBewm5guJk5,,,  certainly talk too much to prove that .
2OBewm5guJk5,,,  And because we live in a polite society people just play along . But inside
2OBewm5guJk6,2.14,2.36,  they 're having an entirely different thought process about this conversation .
2OBewm5guJk6,,,  They will almost never tell you directly that you 're long however they will form
2OBewm5guJk6,,,  unfavorable impression of you anyway . And so it 's very important to realize
2OBewm5guJk6,,,  the impact that long communication can have on your
2OBewm5guJk6,,,  professional relationship and the people around you . So people are long winded
2OBewm5guJk6,,,  for various reason . What 's your reason ? Maybe there 's more than one . Is it
2OBewm5guJk7,2.4,3.03,  insecurity ? Maybe some self ? Do you want to show everything you know
2OBewm5guJk7,,,  like you 're that physician ? Do you like the air time and attention ? In other word
2OBewm5guJk7,,,  doe it feel good when people are listening to you and you love when
2OBewm5guJk7,,,  everyone 's watching you in action ? Do you mistake talking for adding value ? Do
2OBewm5guJk7,,,  mistake more talking for good communication ? Are there some control
2OBewm5guJk7,,,  issue going on in your heart in your mind ? In other word do you like to
2OBewm5guJk8,3.07,3.28,  steer a conversation and be the one talking so you dictate the pace and the
2OBewm5guJk8,,,  flow of thing . Any one of these reason and there are many others could be
2OBewm5guJk8,,,  driving that long . So it 's really important that you take some time
2OBewm5guJk8,,,  and get to the bottom of it .
2OBewm5guJk8,,,  Strategy number two is to gauge your long . Usually there are
2OBewm5guJk8,,,  place and time when you 're not necessarily long and other time you are .
2OBewm5guJk9,3.38,4.02,  Strategy two is to gauge your long . Rate yourself on a scale of 1 to
2OBewm5guJk9,,,  10 . If you 're really concise give yourself a 1 . If you 're somewhere in the middle
2OBewm5guJk9,,,  depending on situation 5 . If you 're really long a 10 . And of course
2OBewm5guJk9,,,  you can give yourself other score . But I would recommend setting a goal to move
2OBewm5guJk9,,,  at least below 5 . Let 's say you want to be from a 1 to 4 range depending upon
2OBewm5guJk9,,,  the situation . Concise strategy number three is to commit to conciseness . As FDR
2OBewm5guJk10,4.08,4.34,  said be sincere be brief and be seated .
2OBewm5guJk10,,,  He 's talking about presentation it sound like . But I think this demonstrates
2OBewm5guJk10,,,  his commitment to conciseness . Because conciseness really set the stage for
2OBewm5guJk10,,,  that clarity and that confidence that we 're all after . And so commitment in
2OBewm5guJk10,,,  this sense mean practicing the tip in this video in the next six lesson . And
2OBewm5guJk10,,,  while you 're doing and remember why you want to be concise clear and confident .
2OBewm5guJk11,4.38,5.03,  Here are some reason . People will pay attention to what you say when you
2OBewm5guJk11,,,  communicate this way . People remember what you say . You 'll have more impact . And
2OBewm5guJk11,,,  you can lead more effectively . So there are lot of good reason to do so .
2OBewm5guJk11,,,  So long this is a key enemy to good communication . Some take strategy .
2OBewm5guJk11,,,  Resolve why you sometimes talk too much . Then gauge your long to
2OBewm5guJk11,,,  help you set that goal . And then commit to practicing the tip in this lesson
2OBewm5guJk13,5.07,5.42,  and the remaining six lesson . So your first step is get to the bottom of your
2OBewm5guJk13,,,  unspoken reason for long . That will really catapult you through this
2OBewm5guJk13,,,  course and help you apply these tip with much more effectiveness . Looking
2OBewm5guJk13,,,  forward we 'll work on how to form a concise overall message concise
2OBewm5guJk13,,,  sentence we 'll work on organizing your thought effective pause avoiding
2OBewm5guJk13,,,  filler and confident nonverbals . If you have n't yet subscribed to this channel
2OBewm5guJk13,,,  Communication Coach I encourage you to do so . And I look forward to seeing you
2OBewm5guJk13,,,  in the next lesson .
a5KYlHNKQB81,0.02,0.2,  Layout and composition .
a5KYlHNKQB81,,,  In a way they 're the foundation of design .
a5KYlHNKQB81,,,  They give your work structure and make it easier to navigate from the margin on the
a5KYlHNKQB81,,,  side ... to the content in between .
a5KYlHNKQB81,,,  Of course it 's not just about working with text .
a5KYlHNKQB81,,,  Composition matter in other medium too like graphic design web design and much
a5KYlHNKQB82,0.25,0.44,  more .
a5KYlHNKQB82,,,  Without a well layout your work would basically ... fall apart .
a5KYlHNKQB82,,,  The key to mastering layout and composition is to think like a designer .
a5KYlHNKQB82,,,  Luckily it 's easier than it sound .
a5KYlHNKQB82,,,  There are five basic principle that can help you transform your work and sharpen your eye
a5KYlHNKQB82,,,  for design .
a5KYlHNKQB83,0.45,1.1,  Let 's start at the top and work our way down .
a5KYlHNKQB83,,,  Proximity is all about using visual space to show relationship in your content .
a5KYlHNKQB83,,,  In practice it 's pretty simple—all you have to do is make sure related item are
a5KYlHNKQB83,,,  grouped together ; for example block of text or element in a graphic .
a5KYlHNKQB83,,,  Groups that are not related to each other should be separated to visually emphasize
a5KYlHNKQB83,,,  their lack of a relationship .
a5KYlHNKQB84,1.12,1.36,  All in all this make your work easier to understand at a glance—whether it 's purely
a5KYlHNKQB84,,,  text or something more visual .
a5KYlHNKQB84,,,  White space is an important part of every composition .
a5KYlHNKQB84,,,  Now this doe n't mean literal `` white space '' —it just mean negative space like the space
a5KYlHNKQB84,,,  between your content between line and even the outer margin .
a5KYlHNKQB84,,,  There 's no `` one way '' to use white space correctly but it 's good to understand it purpose .
a5KYlHNKQB85,1.41,2.02,  White space help you define and separate different section ; it give your content
a5KYlHNKQB85,,,  room to breath .
a5KYlHNKQB85,,,  If your work ever start to feel cluttered or uncomfortable… a little white space might
a5KYlHNKQB85,,,  be just what the doctor ordered .
a5KYlHNKQB85,,,  Alignment is something you deal with all the time even if you do n't realize it .
a5KYlHNKQB85,,,  Whenever you type an email or create a document the text is aligned automatically .
a5KYlHNKQB86,2.07,2.26,  When aligning object by yourself ( for instance image or separate text box ) getting it
a5KYlHNKQB86,,,  right can be tricky .
a5KYlHNKQB86,,,  The most important thing is to be consistent .
a5KYlHNKQB86,,,  Let 's take a look at what that mean .
a5KYlHNKQB86,,,  It might help to imagine your content arranged inside of a grid .
a5KYlHNKQB86,,,  Notice how there 's an invisible line centering each image to the text ?
a5KYlHNKQB87,2.3,2.57,  Each grouping is also evenly spaced and aligned with equal margin .
a5KYlHNKQB87,,,  It 's that attention to detail that make the composition easier to navigate .
a5KYlHNKQB87,,,  Without consistent alignment your work could start to feel disorganized .
a5KYlHNKQB87,,,  Contrast simply mean that one item is different from another .
a5KYlHNKQB87,,,  In layout and composition contrast can help you do many thing ; for example catch the
a5KYlHNKQB87,,,  reader 's eye create emphasis or call attention to something important .
a5KYlHNKQB88,3.02,3.24,  There are lot of strategy or creating contrast .
a5KYlHNKQB88,,,  You can use color ... adjust the size shape or visual weight of an object ... or use contrasting
a5KYlHNKQB88,,,  style of text .
a5KYlHNKQB88,,,  Contrast is also closely tied to hierarchy a visual technique that can help the viewer
a5KYlHNKQB88,,,  navigate you work .
a5KYlHNKQB88,,,  In other word it show them where to begin and where to go next using different level
a5KYlHNKQB89,3.29,3.49,  of emphasis .
a5KYlHNKQB89,,,  Establishing hierarchy is simple : just decide which element you want the reader to notice
a5KYlHNKQB89,,,  first then make them stand out .
a5KYlHNKQB89,,,  High or important item are usually larger bolder or more eye in some
a5KYlHNKQB89,,,  way .
a5KYlHNKQB89,,,  Repetition is a reminder that every project should have a consistent look and feel .
a5KYlHNKQB810,3.54,4.17,  That mean finding way to reinforce your design by repeating or echoing certain element .
a5KYlHNKQB810,,,  For instance if you have a specific color palette look for way to carry it through .
a5KYlHNKQB810,,,  If you 've chosen a special header style use it every time .
a5KYlHNKQB810,,,  It 's not just for aesthetic reasons—being consistent can also make your work easier
a5KYlHNKQB810,,,  to read .
a5KYlHNKQB810,,,  When the viewer know what to expect they can relax and focus on the content .
a5KYlHNKQB811,4.26,4.55,  In many way layout and composition are the unsung hero of design .
a5KYlHNKQB811,,,  It 's easy to overlook their role but they 're part of everything you do .
a5KYlHNKQB811,,,  A nudge here ... some extra white space there ... and voila !
a5KYlHNKQB811,,,  With a little attention to detail you can create beautiful professional composition .
a5KYlHNKQB811,,,  Thanks for joining u for the basic of layout and composition .

a7nz55f9MUY4,0.43,0.53,  reason that you 're not encouraged to do
a7nz55f9MUY4,,,  that is a a tendency when we have the
a7nz55f9MUY4,,,  full outline in front of u to want to
a7nz55f9MUY4,,,  rely on it and we end up sort of reading
a7nz55f9MUY4,,,  our outline rather than delivering our
a7nz55f9MUY4,,,  speech like a professor once said to me
a7nz55f9MUY5,0.55,1.08,  he said Jess a speech is not an essay on
a7nz55f9MUY5,,,  it hind leg now what he meant is that
a7nz55f9MUY5,,,  a speech should not just be an essay
a7nz55f9MUY5,,,  read aloud and if we take our outline
a7nz55f9MUY5,,,  with u a attempting to kind of read
a7nz55f9MUY5,,,  the outline and it end up sounding
a7nz55f9MUY6,1.09,1.2,  like an essay instead of speech that
a7nz55f9MUY6,,,  sound more spontaneous and natural so to
a7nz55f9MUY6,,,  prevent that tendency to read we use
a7nz55f9MUY6,,,  speaking note now when you 're putting
a7nz55f9MUY6,,,  together your speaking note what you 're
a7nz55f9MUY6,,,  going to do is put together a very
a7nz55f9MUY7,1.22,1.33,  abbreviated version of your formal
a7nz55f9MUY7,,,  outline on a few note card instead of
a7nz55f9MUY7,,,  using complete sentence you 're gon na
a7nz55f9MUY7,,,  use a few key word or phrase so instead
a7nz55f9MUY7,,,  of having a formal outline that look
a7nz55f9MUY7,,,  like this you 're going to use speaking
a7nz55f9MUY8,1.35,1.45,  note that are abbreviated and loop and
a7nz55f9MUY8,,,  that look like this now there 's an
a7nz55f9MUY8,,,  occasion where you may be allowed to
a7nz55f9MUY8,,,  write something out completely and
a7nz55f9MUY8,,,  that 's when you have a quotation you may
a7nz55f9MUY8,,,  be allowed to bring a quotation note
a7nz55f9MUY9,1.47,1.57,  card with you if your quotation more
a7nz55f9MUY9,,,  than a sentence or two your professor
a7nz55f9MUY9,,,  will probably allow you to write it out
a7nz55f9MUY9,,,  completely and take it with you now you
a7nz55f9MUY9,,,  may wonder why in this one case do I get
a7nz55f9MUY9,,,  to write it out well when you 're quoting
a7nz55f9MUY10,1.58,2.07,  someone you need to be exact you do n't
a7nz55f9MUY10,,,  want to make any mistake so you 're
a7nz55f9MUY10,,,  allowed to write it out so that you can
a7nz55f9MUY10,,,  refer to it if you need it however even
a7nz55f9MUY10,,,  though it 's written out completely you
a7nz55f9MUY10,,,  do n't want to read the quote you want to
a7nz55f9MUY11,2.1,2.18,  know it 's so well that you can look at
a7nz55f9MUY11,,,  the audience periodically a yours
a7nz55f9MUY11,,,  the quote but you still have it there
a7nz55f9MUY11,,,  for reference if you need it why do n't
a7nz55f9MUY11,,,  you take a look at these student
a7nz55f9MUY11,,,  speaking note do you think they were
a7nz55f9MUY12,2.2,2.31,  effective unfortunately not most of the
a7nz55f9MUY12,,,  student speech suffered because they
a7nz55f9MUY12,,,  did n't follow these important guideline
a7nz55f9MUY12,,,  for developing speaking note each of
a7nz55f9MUY12,,,  you will most of you will probably
a7nz55f9MUY12,,,  relate to what I 'm going to say sorry
a7nz55f9MUY13,2.37,2.55,  one second oh okay each of you will
a7nz55f9MUY13,,,  probably relate to what I 'm going to say
a7nz55f9MUY13,,,  today because most of the source that I
a7nz55f9MUY13,,,  used in resource I I used came from
a7nz55f9MUY13,,,  this campus
a7nz55f9MUY13,,,  one of the first guideline for
a7nz55f9MUY14,2.57,3.06,  developing speaking note ha to do with
a7nz55f9MUY14,,,  the size of the note card typically you
a7nz55f9MUY14,,,  want your note card to be about this
a7nz55f9MUY14,,,  size which is 4 by 6 inch 3 by 5
a7nz55f9MUY14,,,  inch tends to be a little bit small
a7nz55f9MUY14,,,  and hard to read and 5 by 7 tends to be
a7nz55f9MUY15,3.09,3.2,  a little large also you probably want
a7nz55f9MUY15,,,  your note card to either be quiet or
a7nz55f9MUY15,,,  some light pastel color if you use
a7nz55f9MUY15,,,  bright color or especially if you use a
a7nz55f9MUY15,,,  variety of bright color it 's extremely
a7nz55f9MUY15,,,  just distracting for the audience and
a7nz55f9MUY16,3.22,3.33,  you want your note card not to be the
a7nz55f9MUY16,,,  focus of attention so use a pale pastel
a7nz55f9MUY16,,,  or white I also typically recommend that
a7nz55f9MUY16,,,  you only use a few note card maybe one
a7nz55f9MUY16,,,  or two though you may go up to a many
a7nz55f9MUY16,,,  a five or six I recommend one or two
a7nz55f9MUY17,3.36,3.45,  because it make sure that then you do n't
a7nz55f9MUY17,,,  just try to cram your formal outline on
a7nz55f9MUY17,,,  to your speaking note card and if you
a7nz55f9MUY17,,,  have a lot of speaking note card
a7nz55f9MUY17,,,  there 's a real temptation just to cram
a7nz55f9MUY17,,,  it on there and then you end up reading
a7nz55f9MUY18,3.47,3.57,  it after all there 's another reason I
a7nz55f9MUY18,,,  recommend only a few note card if you
a7nz55f9MUY18,,,  have a lot of note card it 's really
a7nz55f9MUY18,,,  easy to get lost if there 's just one or
a7nz55f9MUY18,,,  two you ca n't get lost if you have a lot
a7nz55f9MUY18,,,  and you start getting nervous you might
a7nz55f9MUY19,3.58,4.07,  end up getting your note card out of
a7nz55f9MUY19,,,  order and that 's going to make you look
a7nz55f9MUY19,,,  disorganized and more nervous than you
a7nz55f9MUY19,,,  probably are in addition when you do
a7nz55f9MUY19,,,  your note card you want to use large
a7nz55f9MUY19,,,  font or you want to write quite large so
a7nz55f9MUY20,4.1,4.19,  that you could look down easily you want
a7nz55f9MUY20,,,  it to be very legible so you can glance
a7nz55f9MUY20,,,  down on your note card for just a
a7nz55f9MUY20,,,  second see the key idea and then speak
a7nz55f9MUY20,,,  to the audience directly you also want
a7nz55f9MUY20,,,  to use very short phrase just a word or
a7nz55f9MUY21,4.22,4.31,  two you do n't want to write out a
a7nz55f9MUY21,,,  sentence it 's just remember a word or
a7nz55f9MUY21,,,  two to trigger your memory
a7nz55f9MUY21,,,  not to tell you exactly what you 're
a7nz55f9MUY21,,,  supposed to say recognize that you 're
a7nz55f9MUY21,,,  speaking note are really just a visual
a7nz55f9MUY22,4.33,4.43,  framework to remind you of what your
a7nz55f9MUY22,,,  outline is and what your speech is it 's
a7nz55f9MUY22,,,  just a little hint it 's not the whole
a7nz55f9MUY22,,,  thing now occasionally you might be
a7nz55f9MUY22,,,  using some sort of electronic
a7nz55f9MUY22,,,  presentation program like PowerPoint and
a7nz55f9MUY23,4.45,4.55,  if you do they have a note page option
a7nz55f9MUY23,,,  that may find really helpful for
a7nz55f9MUY23,,,  composing your speaking note now
a7nz55f9MUY23,,,  realize that when you get to the podium
a7nz55f9MUY23,,,  to give your speech your speaking note
a7nz55f9MUY23,,,  are going to be your best friend you 're
a7nz55f9MUY24,4.57,5.04,  going to want to make sure that they 're
a7nz55f9MUY24,,,  in very good shape so you can give a
a7nz55f9MUY24,,,  good speech
a7nz55f9MUY24,,,  you want to write large you want to be
a7nz55f9MUY24,,,  legible use just a freak a few key word
a7nz55f9MUY24,,,  and you also want to make sure you
a7nz55f9MUY26,5.06,5.24,  practice with your note card I 've seen
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  student practice only with their
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  outline until they get up in front of
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  the class and then they 're not used to
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  the note card that it unnerves them so
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  make sure you practice with your note
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  card so that you 're used to using the
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  note card and handling them and you 're
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  used to just working off a few key
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  phrase otherwise your speech probably
a7nz55f9MUY26,,,  wo n't be a good a it can be
qFLL-XB56UU1,0.05,0.23,  Hello this is Steve Campitelli of Academic Skills .
qFLL-XB56UU1,,,  Today we 're presenting `` Presenting Effectively . ''
qFLL-XB56UU1,,,  I 've divided this presentation into two ( 2 ) part .
qFLL-XB56UU1,,,  The first part deal with the presentation itself and how it 's sequenced .
qFLL-XB56UU1,,,  The second part deal with the PowerPoint  the visual 
qFLL-XB56UU1,,,  and some tip and some strategy ;
qFLL-XB56UU2,0.25,0.41,  some idea on how to use that a bit more effectively .
qFLL-XB56UU2,,,  Okay so we 'll make a start .
qFLL-XB56UU2,,,  This doctor  she 's a US professor 
qFLL-XB56UU2,,,  Susan Weinschenk .
qFLL-XB56UU2,,,  She talk about five thing that presenter need to know before they present .
qFLL-XB56UU2,,,  I 'm going to go through those five and we 'll just talk about them a we go .
qFLL-XB56UU3,0.45,1.03,  She talk about dividing information into sequenced chunk .
qFLL-XB56UU3,,,  Now in the same way you view an essay 
qFLL-XB56UU3,,,  or you view your writing  you divide it into sequenced chunk :
qFLL-XB56UU3,,,  An introduction a conclusion section and a body section in the middle .
qFLL-XB56UU3,,,  And she talk about dividing
qFLL-XB56UU3,,,  a longer talk  perhaps one of an hour where you might have a departmental presentation 
qFLL-XB56UU4,1.08,1.26,  or a longer conference workshop in to 20 chunk
qFLL-XB56UU4,,,  and she talk about shorter talk  a 20 conference presentation for example perhaps 
qFLL-XB56UU4,,,  in 5 chunk .
qFLL-XB56UU4,,,  Some great example of how people present and
qFLL-XB56UU4,,,  sequence their information really well : TED Talks .
qFLL-XB56UU4,,,  If you go to ted.com/talks and have a look .
qFLL-XB56UU5,1.29,1.47,  Another one if you have n't checked it out
qFLL-XB56UU5,,,  it 's fantastic it 's a three minute thesis : 3MT .
qFLL-XB56UU5,,,  If you Google or YouTube '3MT ' you can find some great example online
qFLL-XB56UU5,,,  and what happens in 3MT is people doing a PhD
qFLL-XB56UU5,,,  have compressed their thesis into three minute a an oral presentation .
qFLL-XB56UU5,,,  It 's a fantastic example of reduction and sequencing .
qFLL-XB56UU6,1.5,2.11,  She also talk about being aware of multiple sensory channel .
qFLL-XB56UU6,,,  Now there are three ( 3 ) input channel here if you like .
qFLL-XB56UU6,,,  There 's two ( 2 ) visual  one ( 1 ) being you : the presenter ;
qFLL-XB56UU6,,,  the second being the visual  most people present with some sort of visual ;
qFLL-XB56UU6,,,  and the audio channel being what you 're listening to :
qFLL-XB56UU6,,,  me : the presenter  you : the presenter  talking .
qFLL-XB56UU7,2.14,2.27,  Two ( 2 ) visual ; one ( 1 ) audio .
qFLL-XB56UU7,,,  The message is : Do n't make this too busy .
qFLL-XB56UU7,,,  If this ha too much information on it
qFLL-XB56UU7,,,  or it 's too busy there 's too much happening ; if you 're speaking to quickly
qFLL-XB56UU7,,,  and you 're moving around too much
qFLL-XB56UU7,,,  there is input overload . Okay ? Next thing :
qFLL-XB56UU8,2.32,2.44,  What you say is only part of the message . This is pretty clear .
qFLL-XB56UU8,,,  What she 's talking about here is nonverbal behaviour
qFLL-XB56UU8,,,  and the importance of the nonverbal message .
qFLL-XB56UU8,,,  We 'll come back to that .
qFLL-XB56UU8,,,  Another thing she talk about is a 'Call to Action ' .
qFLL-XB56UU8,,,  Now some public speaker require the audience to do something  whether it 's
qFLL-XB56UU9,2.49,3.07,  giving at a charity event or something like that ...
qFLL-XB56UU9,,,  In an academic situation or a conference situation this might be
qFLL-XB56UU9,,,  what do you want them to do or what you want them to know . Okay ?
qFLL-XB56UU9,,,  And I prefer to call this the takeaway message or the take home message .
qFLL-XB56UU9,,,  When the audience leaf through the door at the end of the session
qFLL-XB56UU9,,,  what are they taking away with them ? What have you said ?
qFLL-XB56UU10,3.11,3.29,  And finally :
qFLL-XB56UU10,,,  people imitate your emotion . So even if you feel like
qFLL-XB56UU10,,,  you do n't want to do this and you 're dying inside ... Be positive .
qFLL-XB56UU10,,,  You 've got to look positive and the audience
qFLL-XB56UU10,,,  according to Susan tends to feed off
qFLL-XB56UU10,,,  your positivity or negativity so make it a positive look .
qFLL-XB56UU11,3.33,3.49,  Okay looking at then the organization : if she 's talking about
qFLL-XB56UU11,,,  sequencing or if we 're talking about sequencing and structure
qFLL-XB56UU11,,,  and clear structure essentially any presentation 
qFLL-XB56UU11,,,  no matter what the length  ha three ( 3 ) part .
qFLL-XB56UU11,,,  There 's the introduction : where you tell them what you 're going to tell them ;
qFLL-XB56UU11,,,  the body : where you tell them ;
qFLL-XB56UU12,3.5,4.08,  and the conclusion : where you tell them what you 've just told them .
qFLL-XB56UU12,,,  It 's a simple sort of three structure .
qFLL-XB56UU12,,,  That introduction is essentially setting the context telling them what you 're going to say 
qFLL-XB56UU12,,,  so it could be a part 1 part 2 part 3 ... I 'm going to talk about ...
qFLL-XB56UU12,,,  Consider using a hook .
qFLL-XB56UU12,,,  Now this doe n't always have to be something funny or a joke . It might be
qFLL-XB56UU13,4.12,4.35,  a relevant story it could be a visual it could be an interesting fact it might be a question to the audience .
qFLL-XB56UU13,,,  Some sort of hook to engage the audience
qFLL-XB56UU13,,,  engage the people you 're talking to .
qFLL-XB56UU13,,,  2 : The Body . Remember to split that into section okay ?
qFLL-XB56UU13,,,  Think about what you might present to the neutral listener :
qFLL-XB56UU13,,,  A reasonably intelligent but uninformed audience .
qFLL-XB56UU14,4.38,5,  Tell them the story . Okay ? So what is the logical sequence for it ?
qFLL-XB56UU14,,,  And the conclusion should make clear
qFLL-XB56UU14,,,  the body should a well what the takeaway message is .
qFLL-XB56UU14,,,  So I always say treat this like a
qFLL-XB56UU14,,,  narrative and tell the story logically .
qFLL-XB56UU14,,,  There 're two type of language essentially that you 're using in your writing . It 's the same when
qFLL-XB56UU15,5.04,5.2,  you 're speaking in this sort of semi situation .
qFLL-XB56UU15,,,  There 's content language : that 's what you 're talking about  the topic ;
qFLL-XB56UU15,,,  and there 's functional language which give u 
qFLL-XB56UU15,,,  the listener the audience  signal about what you 're saying .
qFLL-XB56UU15,,,  It might be thing like sectioning .
qFLL-XB56UU15,,,  You know `` First I want to talk about ... '' `` The next thing I want to move on to ... ''
qFLL-XB56UU17,5.24,5.49,  It could be transition : `` Let me move on '' or `` Having said that let me move on to the next point . ''
qFLL-XB56UU17,,,  It might be rephrasing or clarifying .
qFLL-XB56UU17,,,  `` Let me rephrase that ... '' `` Let me point out that ... ''
qFLL-XB56UU17,,,  These thing give signal to the audience that something important is about to be said .
qFLL-XB56UU17,,,  Emphasis ; summary ; concluding ;
qFLL-XB56UU17,,,  moving between section ; giving example ...
qFLL-XB56UU17,,,  All of that type of functional language is extremely important .
wp4ho9raVjA1,0,0.15,  not a long time ago there wa this
wp4ho9raVjA1,,,  famous survey which concluded that most
wp4ho9raVjA1,,,  people fear public speaking more than
wp4ho9raVjA1,,,  they feared death the American comedian
wp4ho9raVjA1,,,  Jerry Seinfeld summed up the statistic
wp4ho9raVjA1,,,  brilliantly when he said so for the
wp4ho9raVjA2,0.19,0.33,  average person if you go to a funeral
wp4ho9raVjA2,,,  you 're better off in the casket than
wp4ho9raVjA2,,,  doing the eulogy that 's funny right
wp4ho9raVjA2,,,  wrong speaking to an audience is
wp4ho9raVjA2,,,  something two out of three people will
wp4ho9raVjA2,,,  do in their professional career so
wp4ho9raVjA3,0.36,0.51,  which person are you would you rather be
wp4ho9raVjA3,,,  the one in the casket or the one
wp4ho9raVjA3,,,  delivering the eulogy the important
wp4ho9raVjA3,,,  thing to remember is that a presentation
wp4ho9raVjA3,,,  is a performance a performance it need
wp4ho9raVjA3,,,  an artist to WoW the audience so come
wp4ho9raVjA4,0.55,1.14,  along now pay attention and take your
wp4ho9raVjA4,,,  first step to becoming a presentation
wp4ho9raVjA4,,,  ninja
wp4ho9raVjA4,,,  you
wp4ho9raVjA4,,,  like with any project you can divide
wp4ho9raVjA4,,,  your presentation into three distinct
wp4ho9raVjA5,1.17,1.31,  phase the planning phase the
wp4ho9raVjA5,,,  performance phase and the reflection
wp4ho9raVjA5,,,  phase let 's first look at the planning
wp4ho9raVjA5,,,  phase the first step is to know your
wp4ho9raVjA5,,,  audience because they 'll be judging your
wp4ho9raVjA5,,,  performance learn a much a you can

wp4ho9raVjA15,,,  and personally one of my favorite
wp4ho9raVjA15,,,  simply because it allows me to show off
wp4ho9raVjA15,,,  my brilliance well not really now we
wp4ho9raVjA15,,,  learn how to use and make most of this
wp4ho9raVjA16,4.4,4.57,  powerful and awesome tool
wp4ho9raVjA16,,,  the final phase is the reflection phase
wp4ho9raVjA16,,,  after the presentation ass it
wp4ho9raVjA16,,,  overall effectiveness ask yourself did
wp4ho9raVjA16,,,  you make the sale did you persuade the
wp4ho9raVjA16,,,  audience to adopt your recommendation
wp4ho9raVjA17,4.59,5.13,  will listener nodding their head in
wp4ho9raVjA17,,,  agreement or sitting with their arm
wp4ho9raVjA17,,,  crossed were they interested or seemed
wp4ho9raVjA17,,,  bored ask analyze and improve if you 're
wp4ho9raVjA17,,,  going to give the presentation again
wp4ho9raVjA17,,,  what change can you make to improve it
wp4ho9raVjA18,5.18,5.35,  in presentation le is always more
wp4ho9raVjA18,,,  plan what your key message will be then
wp4ho9raVjA18,,,  structure the main part of your
wp4ho9raVjA18,,,  presentation around these key theme
wp4ho9raVjA18,,,  this can seem very scary but it work
wp4ho9raVjA18,,,  wonder try to use the entire platform
wp4ho9raVjA19,5.39,5.54,  when you speak it will also demand that
wp4ho9raVjA19,,,  you practice more and focus on your
wp4ho9raVjA19,,,  audience which is always good
wp4ho9raVjA19,,,  human have a very short attention span
wp4ho9raVjA19,,,  shortly after you 've started your
wp4ho9raVjA19,,,  presentation your audience will begin to
wp4ho9raVjA21,5.56,6.18,  wonder when you finish so exactly ten
wp4ho9raVjA21,,,  minute into your presentation do
wp4ho9raVjA21,,,  something different a handy trick to
wp4ho9raVjA21,,,  overcome this lack of focus is by
wp4ho9raVjA21,,,  changing the scene and showing a video
wp4ho9raVjA21,,,  or handing out a sample by doing that
wp4ho9raVjA21,,,  you persuade the audience to refocus on
wp4ho9raVjA21,,,  you
taifW0vJmZk1,0.04,0.2,  I 'd like to start off my presentation
taifW0vJmZk1,,,  today by getting and asking for you for
taifW0vJmZk1,,,  audience participation so I 'll ask if
taifW0vJmZk1,,,  you 're capable to please stand and
taifW0vJmZk1,,,  choose a partner we have an odd number
taifW0vJmZk1,,,  so Dave I might have to be my partner in
taifW0vJmZk2,0.23,0.42,  this one so made you all right so we 're
taifW0vJmZk2,,,  in pair so to make it easy the person
taifW0vJmZk2,,,  with the last name that 's early a in
taifW0vJmZk2,,,  the alphabet will be numbered 1 okay now
taifW0vJmZk2,,,  the first action item take raise your
taifW0vJmZk2,,,  right hand and put it up against your
taifW0vJmZk3,0.46,1.07,  partner 's hand and then on the count of
taifW0vJmZk3,,,  three the person that 's number one is
taifW0vJmZk3,,,  going to push are you ready 123 now
taifW0vJmZk3,,,  what 's interesting about that exercise
taifW0vJmZk3,,,  is there were some commentary that I
taifW0vJmZk3,,,  picked up one person did not push back
taifW0vJmZk4,1.1,1.27,  took their hand completely out of the
taifW0vJmZk4,,,  way the other person almost fell down
taifW0vJmZk4,,,  Byron had asked are we supposed to push
taifW0vJmZk4,,,  back now the point of this story again
taifW0vJmZk4,,,  is what happens when we push others in
taifW0vJmZk4,,,  the majority of u pushed back now just
taifW0vJmZk5,1.32,1.46,  think about that and apply that to your
taifW0vJmZk5,,,  presentation your public speaking and
taifW0vJmZk5,,,  even go bit deeper think about the time
taifW0vJmZk5,,,  you 've been in an audience where you
taifW0vJmZk5,,,  have pushed back against the presenter
taifW0vJmZk5,,,  on their message now think of why that
taifW0vJmZk6,1.5,2.11,  happened did they engage right away did
taifW0vJmZk6,,,  they present their information in term
taifW0vJmZk6,,,  that matter to you well think about that
taifW0vJmZk6,,,  for a moment it 's human behavior when we
taifW0vJmZk6,,,  are pushed we push back so that 's a
taifW0vJmZk6,,,  lesson that we can apply in all of our
taifW0vJmZk7,2.14,2.26,  communication not only in public
taifW0vJmZk7,,,  speaking and front
taifW0vJmZk7,,,  audience but within small team at work
taifW0vJmZk7,,,  anytime we need to persuade someone to
taifW0vJmZk7,,,  take action think of this exercise you
taifW0vJmZk7,,,  just went through and again when you
taifW0vJmZk8,2.3,2.46,  achieve your result by pushing on
taifW0vJmZk8,,,  someone and I 'll be the first to admit I
taifW0vJmZk8,,,  did n't become a master overnight this is
taifW0vJmZk8,,,  an issue that I had to deal with I
taifW0vJmZk8,,,  always came to the presentation
taifW0vJmZk8,,,  thinking I wa the expert and I knew
taifW0vJmZk9,2.49,3.02,  everything and I would get up in front
taifW0vJmZk9,,,  of the room and I would tell each and
taifW0vJmZk9,,,  every person I know what you 're doing
taifW0vJmZk9,,,  wrong just listen to me I do you think
taifW0vJmZk9,,,  that went over they tell me to my face
taifW0vJmZk9,,,  but most likely when they left they
taifW0vJmZk10,3.05,3.18,  blocked out all the information I had
taifW0vJmZk10,,,  shared during that presentation never to
taifW0vJmZk10,,,  be seen from again and that 's where
taifW0vJmZk10,,,  recently I became in London I dug little
taifW0vJmZk10,,,  self awareness a far a my presentation
taifW0vJmZk10,,,  skill my authenticity a a presenter
taifW0vJmZk11,3.21,3.36,  and again where it can I be more
taifW0vJmZk11,,,  effective in my communication and part
taifW0vJmZk11,,,  of it is again persuasion motivation
taifW0vJmZk11,,,  what it my what block am I implementing
taifW0vJmZk11,,,  and putting in front of myself in order
taifW0vJmZk11,,,  to achieve my goal of sharing my message
taifW0vJmZk12,3.39,4.01,  in order for actually be taken so how
taifW0vJmZk12,,,  can you apply this in your communication
taifW0vJmZk12,,,  I would challenge you part of it is
taifW0vJmZk12,,,  being conversational a a speaker but
taifW0vJmZk12,,,  how doe that happen well John Maxwell
taifW0vJmZk12,,,  sent me an email today maybe he sent you
taifW0vJmZk13,4.03,4.23,  an email a well a men at what Maxwell
taifW0vJmZk13,,,  which ha hundred of thousand of
taifW0vJmZk13,,,  member he say the question he like to
taifW0vJmZk13,,,  ask is why why is it this way why are
taifW0vJmZk13,,,  you acting in in this behavior why did
taifW0vJmZk13,,,  you reach this decision and again that
taifW0vJmZk14,4.25,4.43,  open u up to sharing more information
taifW0vJmZk14,,,  a well a helping u see
taifW0vJmZk14,,,  others point of you understand what
taifW0vJmZk14,,,  they are thinking which is very
taifW0vJmZk14,,,  interesting I 'm educating myself I 'm
taifW0vJmZk14,,,  learning to write nonfiction and what 's
taifW0vJmZk15,4.46,5.02,  interesting is that many author let you
taifW0vJmZk15,,,  know the character let you know them
taifW0vJmZk15,,,  more on a personal basis by letting you
taifW0vJmZk15,,,  know what 's ticking what they 're
taifW0vJmZk15,,,  thinking inside their head this is much
taifW0vJmZk15,,,  different than most of our human
taifW0vJmZk16,5.03,5.14,  interaction oftentimes you do n't have
taifW0vJmZk16,,,  the presenter up here telling you what
taifW0vJmZk16,,,  exactly is happening at that moment in
taifW0vJmZk16,,,  time so there 's a bit of a disconnect
taifW0vJmZk16,,,  and that 's the same with audience
taifW0vJmZk16,,,  member the engagement factor so part
taifW0vJmZk17,5.17,5.33,  of being a better affected presenter and
taifW0vJmZk17,,,  communicator is developing your speech
taifW0vJmZk17,,,  and content to put into your
taifW0vJmZk17,,,  presentation way to engage the audience
taifW0vJmZk17,,,  a the example I presented today giving
taifW0vJmZk17,,,  your audience to stand up and
taifW0vJmZk18,5.35,5.49,  participate again creates movement
taifW0vJmZk18,,,  interaction but again ask you have to
taifW0vJmZk18,,,  provide very detailed instruction or it
taifW0vJmZk18,,,  can go off course they could begin
taifW0vJmZk18,,,  chatting about the news the weather so
taifW0vJmZk18,,,  again this is where depending on your
taifW0vJmZk19,5.5,6.04,  time if the view very precise in your
taifW0vJmZk19,,,  messaging and that 's where doe the
taifW0vJmZk19,,,  example that presentation wa done
taifW0vJmZk19,,,  before and that 's where it went off the
taifW0vJmZk19,,,  rail and that 's where I thought about it
taifW0vJmZk19,,,  how what can I bring to the table what
taifW0vJmZk20,6.06,6.25,  can I do when I share it today to
taifW0vJmZk20,,,  clarify the stats so if you know how
taifW0vJmZk20,,,  precise I wa what did I ask you to
taifW0vJmZk20,,,  determine who went first last name and
taifW0vJmZk20,,,  that 's where I said whoever came first
taifW0vJmZk20,,,  in the alphabet i made that decision
taifW0vJmZk21,6.26,6.39,  because oftentimes when you ask an
taifW0vJmZk21,,,  audience and again in any presentation
taifW0vJmZk21,,,  when you ask question of the audience
taifW0vJmZk21,,,  if you 're not very specific and how you
taifW0vJmZk21,,,  want them to answer you 'll confuse them
taifW0vJmZk21,,,  and you 'll lose your
taifW0vJmZk22,6.41,6.57,  ability to motivate and that 's where if
taifW0vJmZk22,,,  I ask a rhetorical question and the
taifW0vJmZk22,,,  audience start giving the answer is
taifW0vJmZk22,,,  then I 've lost my messaging so these
taifW0vJmZk22,,,  easy to implement step our area that I
taifW0vJmZk22,,,  would just challenge you to incorporate
taifW0vJmZk24,6.59,7.17,  a you start developing content for your
taifW0vJmZk24,,,  next presentation because you have the
taifW0vJmZk24,,,  power to be inspirational you have the
taifW0vJmZk24,,,  power to be it more a better
taifW0vJmZk24,,,  communicator in a better
taifW0vJmZk24,,,  conversationalist in front of a room and
taifW0vJmZk24,,,  I look forward to hearing your message
taifW0vJmZk24,,,  and future presentation thank you
XqOC58-strg1,0,0.11,  in some presentation you have to work
XqOC58-strg1,,,  pretty hard to get clear on what your
XqOC58-strg1,,,  main point are we 're going to explore a
XqOC58-strg1,,,  few different way to do this and
XqOC58-strg1,,,  emphasize the topical style of
XqOC58-strg1,,,  organizing your main point so let 's go
XqOC58-strg2,0.13,0.29,  to the computer and drill down on this
XqOC58-strg2,,,  welcome back friend in this video we 're
XqOC58-strg2,,,  going to talk about how to organize the
XqOC58-strg2,,,  main point of a presentation we 'll talk
XqOC58-strg2,,,  about several approach and we 'll drill
XqOC58-strg2,,,  down a little deeper on the topical
XqOC58-strg3,0.3,0.41,  approach which is often the most tricky
XqOC58-strg3,,,  for people we 're assuming here you have
XqOC58-strg3,,,  an introduction body and conclusion to
XqOC58-strg3,,,  your presentation and we 're only talking
XqOC58-strg3,,,  about how to arrange the main point of
XqOC58-strg3,,,  the presentation we 're not talking about
XqOC58-strg4,0.43,0.52,  how to fill the bucket in with detail
XqOC58-strg4,,,  like story an example just the
XqOC58-strg4,,,  ordering and selection of your main
XqOC58-strg4,,,  point first let 's talk about
XqOC58-strg4,,,  chronological this is an approach that
XqOC58-strg4,,,  you can use where time is your key
XqOC58-strg5,0.55,1.07,  variable if you 're teaching somebody how
XqOC58-strg5,,,  to do something for example you might
XqOC58-strg5,,,  talk about the three step involved
XqOC58-strg5,,,  first second third step you often see
XqOC58-strg5,,,  this for how to type presentation if
XqOC58-strg5,,,  it 's a before during and after
XqOC58-strg6,1.09,1.21,  presentation that 's also using time a a
XqOC58-strg6,,,  key variable but here you might talk
XqOC58-strg6,,,  about your life before an issue or time
XqOC58-strg6,,,  and then during which would be maybe the
XqOC58-strg6,,,  focus the transformational experience or
XqOC58-strg6,,,  a certain period of your life that wa
XqOC58-strg7,1.22,1.33,  the center and then after word that 's
XqOC58-strg7,,,  another way to use time spatial is
XqOC58-strg7,,,  another way to arrange main point this
XqOC58-strg7,,,  is not the most common but I may use it
XqOC58-strg7,,,  once in a while I 'm talking about my
XqOC58-strg7,,,  life for example if someone want me to
XqOC58-strg8,1.35,1.47,  talk about different place I 've lived
XqOC58-strg8,,,  in my journey I might organize it in
XqOC58-strg8,,,  term of living in the East then I lived
XqOC58-strg8,,,  in the West and last the South where
XqOC58-strg8,,,  we 're using direction or space symptom
XqOC58-strg8,,,  cause and treatment is another option
XqOC58-strg9,1.49,1.58,  especially in the medical world if
XqOC58-strg9,,,  you 're doing a presentation that
XqOC58-strg9,,,  involves anything medical or healthcare
XqOC58-strg9,,,  related frequently in your physician
XqOC58-strg9,,,  and other medical professional talk
XqOC58-strg9,,,  with these three main point if you 're
XqOC58-strg10,2,2.1,  doing a persuasive presentation it 's
XqOC58-strg10,,,  very likely you 'll be ordering them in a
XqOC58-strg10,,,  problem benefit main point
XqOC58-strg10,,,  order I have a whole separate video on
XqOC58-strg10,,,  this it 's a pretty sophisticated in
XqOC58-strg10,,,  Psychological approach to organ
XqOC58-strg11,2.12,2.22,  main point it 's a little more
XqOC58-strg11,,,  intermediate or advanced but it is a
XqOC58-strg11,,,  great approach if you want to convince
XqOC58-strg11,,,  people to your point of view or convince
XqOC58-strg11,,,  them to take some action I have a whole
XqOC58-strg11,,,  separate video like I mentioned I 'll put
XqOC58-strg12,2.24,2.34,  the link to that video in the
XqOC58-strg12,,,  description below now we get to the
XqOC58-strg12,,,  topical approach to organizing main
XqOC58-strg12,,,  point this one often throw people off
XqOC58-strg12,,,  because there 's no one right way to
XqOC58-strg12,,,  select the subtopics of your
XqOC58-strg13,2.37,2.5,  presentation if you have a subject
XqOC58-strg13,,,  that 's not chronological that 's not
XqOC58-strg13,,,  problem solution benefit then how do you
XqOC58-strg13,,,  do it well you have to think about the
XqOC58-strg13,,,  overall topic and then break it down
XqOC58-strg13,,,  into it subtopics that 's right I think
XqOC58-strg14,2.52,3.02,  that 's a more accurate way to describe
XqOC58-strg14,,,  this subtopics so the idea here is you
XqOC58-strg14,,,  have a whole you have a subject you 're
XqOC58-strg14,,,  speaking on and you have a focus a main
XqOC58-strg14,,,  point a thesis then you have to figure
XqOC58-strg14,,,  out well what are the natural part of
XqOC58-strg15,3.04,3.18,  that thesis of that whole and those
XqOC58-strg15,,,  become your main point your main point
XqOC58-strg15,,,  will depend upon the unique aspect of
XqOC58-strg15,,,  the subject itself no two topic or
XqOC58-strg15,,,  alike and so you 'll have to figure that
XqOC58-strg15,,,  out a you go there 's a little more art
XqOC58-strg16,3.2,3.31,  to this than science so for example if
XqOC58-strg16,,,  you 're talking about dinosaur one way
XqOC58-strg16,,,  to do it would be to talk about the land
XqOC58-strg16,,,  sea and air dinosaur if you 're doing
XqOC58-strg16,,,  your research and you 're reading about
XqOC58-strg16,,,  dinosaur that 's one of the main way
XqOC58-strg17,3.33,3.44,  that your author and researcher will
XqOC58-strg17,,,  break this up but it 's not the only way
XqOC58-strg17,,,  you might talk about small medium and
XqOC58-strg17,,,  large dinosaur and so you have to
XqOC58-strg17,,,  figure out what your main point is to
XqOC58-strg17,,,  the whole presentation and then figure
XqOC58-strg18,3.46,3.58,  out how to break that into it natural
XqOC58-strg18,,,  part you might be talking about meat
XqOC58-strg18,,,  for example in a different subject a
XqOC58-strg18,,,  different presentation and you might
XqOC58-strg18,,,  discus beef chicken and fish a your
XqOC58-strg18,,,  main point but a you 're reading and a
XqOC58-strg19,4,4.09,  you 're researching your focus might
XqOC58-strg19,,,  change a little bit annually I 'm not
XqOC58-strg19,,,  really talking about meat a much a I
XqOC58-strg19,,,  am about protein source for your diet
XqOC58-strg19,,,  so then you might back out and rearrange
XqOC58-strg19,,,  these and talk about meat bean and
XqOC58-strg20,4.11,4.22,  supplement I 've seen people do it this
XqOC58-strg20,,,  way because these are different
XqOC58-strg20,,,  approach to different way to get your
XqOC58-strg20,,,  protein in your diet may be camping gear
XqOC58-strg20,,,  is a topic you 're passionate about
XqOC58-strg20,,,  isotopic I love to talk about a lot of
XqOC58-strg21,4.24,4.34,  my video because it 's
XqOC58-strg21,,,  my main thing I do in the summertime
XqOC58-strg21,,,  and the nice weather I camp with my
XqOC58-strg21,,,  family and if I were doing that I would
XqOC58-strg21,,,  talk about maybe my tent sleeping bag
XqOC58-strg21,,,  and backpack that 's one of the way to
XqOC58-strg22,4.36,4.48,  discus the gear these are the subtopics
XqOC58-strg22,,,  of camping gear that you commonly hear
XqOC58-strg22,,,  about when you reading in magazine and
XqOC58-strg22,,,  researching it so you if you 're in a
XqOC58-strg22,,,  professional situation this is where it
XqOC58-strg22,,,  get a little tricky because let 's say
XqOC58-strg23,4.5,5,  you 're doing an update at a meeting well
XqOC58-strg23,,,  every audience is there is different
XqOC58-strg23,,,  people at every meeting you go to and it
XqOC58-strg23,,,  ha on what level of executive or
XqOC58-strg23,,,  manager you 're speaking to and well ti
XqOC58-strg23,,,  their time a year and what the overall
XqOC58-strg24,5.03,5.12,  focus and agenda is for the meeting but
XqOC58-strg24,,,  you might for example if you 're doing a
XqOC58-strg24,,,  normal update on your department you
XqOC58-strg24,,,  might talk about the different project
XqOC58-strg24,,,  the budget and the staffing that 's three
XqOC58-strg24,,,  way three topic to break up your
XqOC58-strg25,5.15,5.27,  update into so the part have to be from
XqOC58-strg25,,,  the same hole and that 's a real lesson
XqOC58-strg25,,,  to take away from this if you have a
XqOC58-strg25,,,  subject you 've really got to figure out
XqOC58-strg25,,,  what the natural part are and because
XqOC58-strg25,,,  when you go off in the wrong direction
XqOC58-strg26,5.29,5.39,  something 's not going to seem right to
XqOC58-strg26,,,  listener it wo n't hang together and be
XqOC58-strg26,,,  logical if you change the pattern you
XqOC58-strg26,,,  change the variable you 're using to
XqOC58-strg26,,,  decide on your main point for example
XqOC58-strg26,,,  if I were talking about camping gear and
XqOC58-strg27,5.41,5.53,  I talked about tent and sleeping bag
XqOC58-strg27,,,  and I threw in this weird extra point
XqOC58-strg27,,,  about saving money that 's going to be
XqOC58-strg27,,,  awkward that 's going to be odd and it 's
XqOC58-strg27,,,  breaking the pattern in the topical
XqOC58-strg27,,,  order here and changing subtopics in a
XqOC58-strg28,5.56,6.04,  way that 's going to stand out a little
XqOC58-strg28,,,  bit it 's not going to have that not
XqOC58-strg28,,,  natural logical flow you might also be
XqOC58-strg28,,,  talking about dinosaur or come back to
XqOC58-strg28,,,  this example small medium and then you
XqOC58-strg28,,,  throw in there oh and also we 'll talk
XqOC58-strg30,6.06,6.31,  about dinosaur that fly that 's again
XqOC58-strg30,,,  going to break your pattern so you have
XqOC58-strg30,,,  to figure out what your hole is and then
XqOC58-strg30,,,  break that into it natural part and
XqOC58-strg30,,,  that 's really the key aspect of the
XqOC58-strg30,,,  topical main point approach you want to
XqOC58-strg30,,,  figure out how to break the hole into
XqOC58-strg30,,,  it part so I hope this video ha been
XqOC58-strg30,,,  helpful and I encourage you to use it in
XqOC58-strg30,,,  your next presentation so god bless and
XqOC58-strg30,,,  I will see you next time
bWfN-nczoJI1,0.04,0.14,  hey there welcome back to project
bWfN-nczoJI1,,,  management made easy today we 're going
bWfN-nczoJI1,,,  to be talking about how you can
bWfN-nczoJI1,,,  structure your presentation so let 's
bWfN-nczoJI1,,,  get to it
bWfN-nczoJI1,,,  now that we 've had a chance to talk
bWfN-nczoJI2,0.16,0.29,  about visuals and body language we can
bWfN-nczoJI2,,,  now get into the presentation itself
bWfN-nczoJI2,,,  where do you start regardless of
bWfN-nczoJI2,,,  different presentation goal there 's one
bWfN-nczoJI2,,,  thing everyone love a good story I 'm
bWfN-nczoJI2,,,  going to show you how you can structure
bWfN-nczoJI3,0.31,0.43,  your presentation like a story so that
bWfN-nczoJI3,,,  you keep your audience engaged your
bWfN-nczoJI3,,,  memorable they leave feeling a if
bWfN-nczoJI3,,,  they 've learned something and you 've
bWfN-nczoJI3,,,  changed their perspective and maybe they
bWfN-nczoJI3,,,  may even be motivated to take action at
bWfN-nczoJI4,0.45,0.57,  the end first we want to start with what
bWfN-nczoJI4,,,  is whether you 're doing a sale pitch or
bWfN-nczoJI4,,,  an annual investor meeting the status
bWfN-nczoJI4,,,  quo is what you want to point out first
bWfN-nczoJI4,,,  and foremost this is important because
bWfN-nczoJI4,,,  your audience is trusting you to fill
bWfN-nczoJI5,0.59,1.13,  them in on what is what is the current
bWfN-nczoJI5,,,  state of affair where do we stand it 's
bWfN-nczoJI5,,,  your responsibility a a presenter to
bWfN-nczoJI5,,,  build the tension and allow a they say
bWfN-nczoJI5,,,  the plot to thicken after you 've
bWfN-nczoJI5,,,  established what is and why the meeting
bWfN-nczoJI6,1.15,1.26,  is happening it 's time to show them a
bWfN-nczoJI6,,,  better way this is an opportunity to
bWfN-nczoJI6,,,  discus alternative new idea and
bWfN-nczoJI6,,,  option to solve what is look at what is
bWfN-nczoJI6,,,  and what could be for each point you are
bWfN-nczoJI6,,,  trying to make this help keep their
bWfN-nczoJI7,1.28,1.4,  attention just like a story that will be
bWfN-nczoJI7,,,  lost in both hope and despair
bWfN-nczoJI7,,,  simultaneously that 's a good thing let 's
bWfN-nczoJI7,,,  take a general quarterly marketing
bWfN-nczoJI7,,,  meeting for example it would sound
bWfN-nczoJI7,,,  something like this
bWfN-nczoJI8,1.41,1.55,  we missed our cue three lead number by
bWfN-nczoJI8,,,  12 % this could impact our
bWfN-nczoJI8,,,  end bonus if we do n't
bWfN-nczoJI8,,,  finish strong in q4 but our we have a
bWfN-nczoJI8,,,  new content strategy team that will be
bWfN-nczoJI8,,,  working to bring the leader they are
bWfN-nczoJI9,1.58,2.11,  top performer in the industry and have
bWfN-nczoJI9,,,  the potential to help u supersede our
bWfN-nczoJI9,,,  goal but the team requires new tool in
bWfN-nczoJI9,,,  order to be effective at their job in
bWfN-nczoJI9,,,  that case we 'll be implementing
bWfN-nczoJI9,,,  for them this is called the persuasive
bWfN-nczoJI10,2.14,2.25,  story structure it pull you back and
bWfN-nczoJI10,,,  forth keep you on the edge hoping that
bWfN-nczoJI10,,,  there are solution to all these
bWfN-nczoJI10,,,  problem
bWfN-nczoJI10,,,  it 's what the best storyteller do and
bWfN-nczoJI10,,,  what the best speaker do some really
bWfN-nczoJI11,2.28,2.42,  good example of using this method is
bWfN-nczoJI11,,,  when Steve Jobs gave the convocation
bWfN-nczoJI11,,,  address at Stanford University or when
bWfN-nczoJI11,,,  JK Rowling spoke at Harvard you should
bWfN-nczoJI11,,,  really check out those speech finally
bWfN-nczoJI11,,,  you want to make the ending effective by
bWfN-nczoJI13,2.44,3,  involving a call to action so that your
bWfN-nczoJI13,,,  team is inspired and ready to make
bWfN-nczoJI13,,,  thing happen if you 're looking for more
bWfN-nczoJI13,,,  tip check out HBO 's guide to persuasive
bWfN-nczoJI13,,,  presentation so that 's it for how you
bWfN-nczoJI13,,,  can structure your presentation next
bWfN-nczoJI13,,,  week we 're going to be getting into some
bWfN-nczoJI13,,,  agile project management see you then
RVPW9MWPO3Y1,0,0.12,  if you 're taking this course one of the
RVPW9MWPO3Y1,,,  question that might have drawn you into
RVPW9MWPO3Y1,,,  the course is the question of why do
RVPW9MWPO3Y1,,,  McKenzie and Bain & BCG presentation
RVPW9MWPO3Y1,,,  feel or look so different than
RVPW9MWPO3Y1,,,  everything else so I want to unveil this
RVPW9MWPO3Y2,0.15,0.28,  some of the secret here with the three
RVPW9MWPO3Y2,,,  core quote unquote secret I 'll teach
RVPW9MWPO3Y2,,,  you here and the whole goal is to avoid
RVPW9MWPO3Y2,,,  presentation like this if you 've ever
RVPW9MWPO3Y2,,,  been in a presentation where somebody 's
RVPW9MWPO3Y2,,,  presenting a slide like this you know
RVPW9MWPO3Y3,0.3,0.47,  how painful it is to be in the audience
RVPW9MWPO3Y3,,,  let 's avoid that so what make McKinsey
RVPW9MWPO3Y3,,,  presentation different I would argue
RVPW9MWPO3Y3,,,  it 's something I 'm calling flow which is
RVPW9MWPO3Y3,,,  that the presentation is easy to digest
RVPW9MWPO3Y3,,,  even though it ha complex information
RVPW9MWPO3Y4,0.49,1.08,  and is presented in a way that is very
RVPW9MWPO3Y4,,,  easy to consume so how doe flow play
RVPW9MWPO3Y4,,,  out it 's three thing one is vertical
RVPW9MWPO3Y4,,,  flow this is the core idea that the
RVPW9MWPO3Y4,,,  title is the cell what you want to use
RVPW9MWPO3Y4,,,  the title in PowerPoint to really tell
RVPW9MWPO3Y5,1.12,1.28,  the audience what the takeaway of the
RVPW9MWPO3Y5,,,  information is and what they should do
RVPW9MWPO3Y5,,,  next second is the horizontal flow the
RVPW9MWPO3Y5,,,  deck from slide to slide ha a story and
RVPW9MWPO3Y5,,,  is part of a larger narrative and make
RVPW9MWPO3Y5,,,  sense and third is the overall flow and
RVPW9MWPO3Y6,1.32,1.48,  this really come together through
RVPW9MWPO3Y6,,,  mastering the pyramid principle and mici
RVPW9MWPO3Y6,,,  concept which we have been hammering
RVPW9MWPO3Y6,,,  over and over again in this course
RVPW9MWPO3Y6,,,  finally one thing that really set apart
RVPW9MWPO3Y6,,,  presentation especially from my
RVPW9MWPO3Y7,1.5,2.03,  experience have been McKinsey and BCG
RVPW9MWPO3Y7,,,  wa the amount of feedback that people
RVPW9MWPO3Y7,,,  get often you 're getting a ton of
RVPW9MWPO3Y7,,,  feedback from peer one slide doe n't
RVPW9MWPO3Y7,,,  just get created and sent to a client
RVPW9MWPO3Y7,,,  it 's often looked at hundred of time
RVPW9MWPO3Y8,2.06,2.19,  and colleague are giving people note
RVPW9MWPO3Y8,,,  saying maybe you could put the title
RVPW9MWPO3Y8,,,  this way maybe you could synthesize it
RVPW9MWPO3Y8,,,  more effectively so a good lesson here
RVPW9MWPO3Y8,,,  is to make sure you 're finding someone
RVPW9MWPO3Y8,,,  in your team that you trust and can
RVPW9MWPO3Y9,2.21,2.37,  challenge you to help make your content
RVPW9MWPO3Y9,,,  better vertical flow is perhaps the most
RVPW9MWPO3Y9,,,  important concept when building out a
RVPW9MWPO3Y9,,,  PowerPoint presentation it 's the concept
RVPW9MWPO3Y9,,,  that the title match the content there
RVPW9MWPO3Y9,,,  need to be an alignment between what
RVPW9MWPO3Y10,2.39,2.52,  you 're actually showing in the slide and
RVPW9MWPO3Y10,,,  the title which tell the audience what
RVPW9MWPO3Y10,,,  to think or synthesizes the information
RVPW9MWPO3Y10,,,  on the slide often people put together
RVPW9MWPO3Y10,,,  slide with lot of information and then
RVPW9MWPO3Y10,,,  add a title that 's just description that
RVPW9MWPO3Y11,2.55,3.08,  say something like quarter three data
RVPW9MWPO3Y11,,,  right and then you 're looking at all
RVPW9MWPO3Y11,,,  this information it 's just information
RVPW9MWPO3Y11,,,  you do n't actually know what the key
RVPW9MWPO3Y11,,,  takeaway or the insight is so this is
RVPW9MWPO3Y11,,,  one of my favorite example because it 's
RVPW9MWPO3Y12,3.11,3.29,  done where the content ha no word but
RVPW9MWPO3Y12,,,  the takeaway is there 's more than one
RVPW9MWPO3Y12,,,  way to create a square and we show and
RVPW9MWPO3Y12,,,  prove this visually another thing to
RVPW9MWPO3Y12,,,  remember here is a lot of company and
RVPW9MWPO3Y12,,,  just people in general are moving to a
RVPW9MWPO3Y13,3.31,3.44,  sixteen by nine layout so vertical logic
RVPW9MWPO3Y13,,,  I do n't want to confuse you here can
RVPW9MWPO3Y13,,,  also apply horizontally the key is just
RVPW9MWPO3Y13,,,  what are people going to read first
RVPW9MWPO3Y13,,,  right
RVPW9MWPO3Y13,,,  same thing here there 's more than one
RVPW9MWPO3Y14,3.46,4.02,  way to create a square and then you
RVPW9MWPO3Y14,,,  prove it in the core of the slide again
RVPW9MWPO3Y14,,,  put the takeaway where people look first
RVPW9MWPO3Y14,,,  here 's another example I love very
RVPW9MWPO3Y14,,,  simple visual not a lot of content one
RVPW9MWPO3Y14,,,  out of four people are green right and
RVPW9MWPO3Y15,4.04,4.19,  then you have the content that back
RVPW9MWPO3Y15,,,  this up and show it horizontal flow is
RVPW9MWPO3Y15,,,  the second concept and it build on the
RVPW9MWPO3Y15,,,  first one so once you have the title
RVPW9MWPO3Y15,,,  matching the content you want to make
RVPW9MWPO3Y15,,,  sure that your individual slide when
RVPW9MWPO3Y16,4.22,4.35,  combined actually tell a story going
RVPW9MWPO3Y16,,,  from slide one to slide two
RVPW9MWPO3Y16,,,  side three and so on doe it actually
RVPW9MWPO3Y16,,,  make sense there 's a couple technique
RVPW9MWPO3Y16,,,  for doing that but the core idea is do
RVPW9MWPO3Y16,,,  the title tell the story if they do n't
RVPW9MWPO3Y17,4.38,4.54,  you still have work to do
RVPW9MWPO3Y17,,,  so an easy way to check this you just go
RVPW9MWPO3Y17,,,  through your slide one by one in this
RVPW9MWPO3Y17,,,  you can do this in the slide sorter view
RVPW9MWPO3Y17,,,  or just flip through or even just
RVPW9MWPO3Y17,,,  printing it and look at the title flip
RVPW9MWPO3Y18,4.57,5.11,  through doe it tell a story another way
RVPW9MWPO3Y18,,,  you can do this is in PowerPoint just go
RVPW9MWPO3Y18,,,  to the outline view in the top left and
RVPW9MWPO3Y18,,,  you can just highlight copy and paste
RVPW9MWPO3Y18,,,  the title to word and then you can
RVPW9MWPO3Y18,,,  start editing it a you 're writing it
RVPW9MWPO3Y19,5.14,5.27,  you can also use this to turn it into an
RVPW9MWPO3Y19,,,  executive summary but the point is just
RVPW9MWPO3Y19,,,  get the title in a different format so
RVPW9MWPO3Y19,,,  they 're easy to read and say do these
RVPW9MWPO3Y19,,,  even make sense so what doe a good
RVPW9MWPO3Y19,,,  slide look like let 's go through the
RVPW9MWPO3Y20,5.29,5.45,  element that make up a slide guy it is
RVPW9MWPO3Y20,,,  solid now this slide is all fake data
RVPW9MWPO3Y20,,,  but put together to show a couple of key
RVPW9MWPO3Y20,,,  principle so let 's look at it in more
RVPW9MWPO3Y20,,,  depth first the title provides a clear
RVPW9MWPO3Y20,,,  takeaway it 's a the company is growing
RVPW9MWPO3Y21,5.48,6.03,  consistently driven by three key action
RVPW9MWPO3Y21,,,  now that also summarizes all the
RVPW9MWPO3Y21,,,  information in the slide a key thing to
RVPW9MWPO3Y21,,,  avoid is not having excess information
RVPW9MWPO3Y21,,,  in the slide and you can confirm this by
RVPW9MWPO3Y21,,,  saying doe the title cover everything
RVPW9MWPO3Y22,6.05,6.18,  if not perhaps there 's content in the
RVPW9MWPO3Y22,,,  slide that you do n't actually need also
RVPW9MWPO3Y22,,,  in this slide the subtitle offer clear
RVPW9MWPO3Y22,,,  takeaway instead of just saying revenue
RVPW9MWPO3Y22,,,  and labeling it like many chart are
RVPW9MWPO3Y22,,,  labeled say revenue quadrupled in four
RVPW9MWPO3Y23,6.2,6.34,  year it give the audience a frame of
RVPW9MWPO3Y23,,,  reference for the degree of change also
RVPW9MWPO3Y23,,,  we have another subtitle three key
RVPW9MWPO3Y23,,,  action drove revenue growth that frame
RVPW9MWPO3Y23,,,  up the three key reason below
RVPW9MWPO3Y23,,,  also we use bolding and spacing to
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,6.37,7.06,  really pull out what are the three key
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  element geographic expansion building
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  out the sale team and acquiring a
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  competitor again let 's look at the slide
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  with the shape and the argument is up
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  top there 's more than one way to create
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  a square that 's what you want to
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  persuade the audience of and then you
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  have the proof in the content and you
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  want to use this core idea for every
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,,,  slide you create
4prTn3SnLyI1,0.01,0.11,  hello welcome to robin 's daily english
4prTn3SnLyI1,,,  we know good presentation skill are the
4prTn3SnLyI1,,,  most important skill
4prTn3SnLyI1,,,  because if you have effective
4prTn3SnLyI1,,,  presentation skill
4prTn3SnLyI1,,,  this mean you are good at communicating
4prTn3SnLyI2,0.15,0.26,  however one of the key fact of an
4prTn3SnLyI2,,,  effective presentation is it
4prTn3SnLyI2,,,  structure a good structure help you
4prTn3SnLyI2,,,  remain
4prTn3SnLyI2,,,  calm stay on topic and avoid any awkward
4prTn3SnLyI2,,,  silence
4prTn3SnLyI3,0.28,0.4,  during the presentation a typical
4prTn3SnLyI3,,,  presentation structure cover
4prTn3SnLyI3,,,  all the vital section and is a good
4prTn3SnLyI3,,,  starting point for yours
4prTn3SnLyI3,,,  it allows your audience to easily follow
4prTn3SnLyI3,,,  you during the presentation
4prTn3SnLyI4,0.43,0.57,  now let 's see the different part of our
4prTn3SnLyI4,,,  typical presentation
4prTn3SnLyI4,,,  part one greeting before you start
4prTn3SnLyI4,,,  delivering your talk
4prTn3SnLyI4,,,  greet the audience for instance
4prTn3SnLyI4,,,  you can greet like this good morning
4prTn3SnLyI5,1,1.16,  dear lady and gentleman
4prTn3SnLyI5,,,  or good morning dear colleague
4prTn3SnLyI5,,,  the selection of greeting depends on the
4prTn3SnLyI5,,,  time of your presentation
4prTn3SnLyI5,,,  a well a on the type of your audience
4prTn3SnLyI5,,,  based on the time of the presentation
4prTn3SnLyI6,1.19,1.3,  you may
4prTn3SnLyI6,,,  say good morning good afternoon or good
4prTn3SnLyI6,,,  evening
4prTn3SnLyI6,,,  so check with the time of the
4prTn3SnLyI6,,,  presentation beforehand
4prTn3SnLyI6,,,  also check about the target audience 's
4prTn3SnLyI7,1.34,1.5,  gender beforehand we usually say
4prTn3SnLyI7,,,  dear lady and gentleman
4prTn3SnLyI7,,,  but no female audience might be present
4prTn3SnLyI7,,,  during the presentation
4prTn3SnLyI7,,,  if you greet dear lady and gentleman
4prTn3SnLyI7,,,  but there is no lady
4prTn3SnLyI8,1.52,2.08,  it will create an awkward situation for
4prTn3SnLyI8,,,  you

4prTn3SnLyI11,,,  a student of the bsc software
4prTn3SnLyI11,,,  engineering

4prTn3SnLyI16,4.06,4.19,  ultrafirst accounting software ha
4prTn3SnLyI16,,,  already
4prTn3SnLyI16,,,  gained the trust of the corporate sector
4prTn3SnLyI16,,,  here based on my experience i would like
4prTn3SnLyI16,,,  to draw your attention
4prTn3SnLyI16,,,  to an important issue that is
4prTn3SnLyI17,4.22,4.39,  question session in this section
4prTn3SnLyI17,,,  you should share your policy on question
4prTn3SnLyI17,,,  session usually during any presentation
4prTn3SnLyI17,,,  if audience asks question
4prTn3SnLyI17,,,  but if the audience asks question
4prTn3SnLyI17,,,  on and on during your talk
4prTn3SnLyI18,4.42,4.57,  you may detract it may detract your
4prTn3SnLyI18,,,  attention
4prTn3SnLyI18,,,  so i would suggest you share
4prTn3SnLyI18,,,  your question policy with the audience
4prTn3SnLyI18,,,  before you go to the next stage
4prTn3SnLyI18,,,  but how will you say you may say

4prTn3SnLyI19,,,  at the end of the presentation for your
4prTn3SnLyI19,,,  convenience
4prTn3SnLyI19,,,  i have reserved the question session for
4prTn3SnLyI20,5.13,5.33,  you
4prTn3SnLyI20,,,  you know this will help you
4prTn3SnLyI20,,,  to continue your talk a per your plan
4prTn3SnLyI20,,,  without being interrupted unexpectedly
4prTn3SnLyI20,,,  thought poll main point
4prTn3SnLyI20,,,  this section is the backbone of your
4prTn3SnLyI21,5.36,5.48,  presentation
4prTn3SnLyI21,,,  before you start with the slide
4prTn3SnLyI21,,,  presentation
4prTn3SnLyI21,,,  on the main point tell a
4prTn3SnLyI21,,,  short a relevant story
4prTn3SnLyI21,,,  it can help build rappo with the
4prTn3SnLyI22,5.51,6.04,  audience
4prTn3SnLyI22,,,  you must deliver your statement with

4prTn3SnLyI22,,,  after you have in identified your main
4prTn3SnLyI22,,,  point
4prTn3SnLyI23,6.05,6.2,  you should elaborate on them with
4prTn3SnLyI23,,,  supporting information
4prTn3SnLyI23,,,  like diagram table graph
4prTn3SnLyI23,,,  chart and so on
4prTn3SnLyI23,,,  use the supporting information to add
4prTn3SnLyI23,,,  color
4prTn3SnLyI24,6.21,6.4,  and interest to your talk but

df2XcxcdE1A1,0,0.14,  hello i am Ram Gopal from presentation
df2XcxcdE1A1,,,  process calm in this edition of
df2XcxcdE1A1,,,  PowerPoint diagram tutorial series you
df2XcxcdE1A1,,,  will learn how to create brick wall
df2XcxcdE1A1,,,  texture in PowerPoint the brick wall
df2XcxcdE1A1,,,  texture you will learn to create look
df2XcxcdE1A2,0.16,0.32,  like this is n't this beautiful once you
df2XcxcdE1A2,,,  create the 2d version you can also
df2XcxcdE1A2,,,  create the 3d version by applying 3d
df2XcxcdE1A2,,,  effect to the texture that we have
df2XcxcdE1A2,,,  created let u see how to create the
df2XcxcdE1A2,,,  brick wall texture from scratch by going
df2XcxcdE1A3,0.34,0.51,  to a new slide the first step is to go
df2XcxcdE1A3,,,  to auto ship menu and under rectangle
df2XcxcdE1A3,,,  pick up this basic rectangle shape and
df2XcxcdE1A3,,,  draw the size of a brick so this this is
df2XcxcdE1A3,,,  the brick that you are going to
df2XcxcdE1A3,,,  replicate now select that one and while
df2XcxcdE1A4,0.54,1.11,  holding the ctrl button move the
df2XcxcdE1A4,,,  rectangle to the desired position you
df2XcxcdE1A4,,,  can have it a close to the previous one
df2XcxcdE1A4,,,  a you want now select both of them and
df2XcxcdE1A4,,,  while holding ctrl make one more copy
df2XcxcdE1A4,,,  and hold them there and if you want one
df2XcxcdE1A5,1.15,1.3,  more brick here you can hold ctrl and
df2XcxcdE1A5,,,  move it here so now we have got the
df2XcxcdE1A5,,,  first level of brick ready the first
df2XcxcdE1A5,,,  the bottom level ready now select all of
df2XcxcdE1A5,,,  them press ctrl G to group them and now
df2XcxcdE1A5,,,  this whole group can be replicated so
df2XcxcdE1A6,1.33,1.5,  you are going to press ctrl tab and make
df2XcxcdE1A6,,,  a copy here now when you make
df2XcxcdE1A6,,,  another copy of the same what it doe n't
df2XcxcdE1A6,,,  look like a brick wall so all you need
df2XcxcdE1A6,,,  to do is to move this slightly off so
df2XcxcdE1A6,,,  that you 're able to see a proper brick
df2XcxcdE1A7,1.53,2.12,  wall arrangement now once you do that
df2XcxcdE1A7,,,  once again the next step is to ungroup
df2XcxcdE1A7,,,  them group and group now align this
df2XcxcdE1A7,,,  brick with the bottom one so there we
df2XcxcdE1A7,,,  are we are able to do that and here
df2XcxcdE1A7,,,  again do the same thing for this one now
df2XcxcdE1A8,2.16,2.29,  this look more like the brick wall
df2XcxcdE1A8,,,  arrangement now that we have done this
df2XcxcdE1A8,,,  ctrl G so that you can group them and
df2XcxcdE1A8,,,  all you need to do is to keep
df2XcxcdE1A8,,,  duplicating this till the time you get
df2XcxcdE1A8,,,  the height your desire maybe I can
df2XcxcdE1A9,2.34,2.55,  select all of them once again and have
df2XcxcdE1A9,,,  them arranged on top and there we are
df2XcxcdE1A9,,,  the structure is ready now ungroup all
df2XcxcdE1A9,,,  of them now we have individual brick
df2XcxcdE1A9,,,  available now the time is it is now time
df2XcxcdE1A9,,,  to add some gradient to these shape now
df2XcxcdE1A10,3,3.13,  select all of them now go to shape fill
df2XcxcdE1A10,,,  and the color I 'm going to use is this
df2XcxcdE1A10,,,  one called a red accent to darker
df2XcxcdE1A10,,,  twenty percent now this look
df2XcxcdE1A10,,,  fairly plain I do n't want it that way so
df2XcxcdE1A10,,,  i am going to give some gradient color
df2XcxcdE1A11,3.15,3.27,  so once again let me go to shape fill
df2XcxcdE1A11,,,  and this time go to gradient and the
df2XcxcdE1A11,,,  gradient i 'm going to choose is this one
df2XcxcdE1A11,,,  called a linear right now this look
df2XcxcdE1A11,,,  more like a brick wall texture and the
df2XcxcdE1A11,,,  shape outline can be something greyish
df2XcxcdE1A12,3.3,3.44,  like this one which you want to have
df2XcxcdE1A12,,,  slightly thicker
df2XcxcdE1A12,,,  outline you can do that and there it is
df2XcxcdE1A12,,,  so there we have the 2d version of the
df2XcxcdE1A12,,,  brick wall texture let me show you how
df2XcxcdE1A12,,,  to apply the 3d to the same one so let
df2XcxcdE1A13,3.48,4.04,  me select all of that and press ctrl G
df2XcxcdE1A13,,,  to group it right click go to format
df2XcxcdE1A13,,,  shape and let me go to effect option
df2XcxcdE1A13,,,  and under 3d rotation let me choose the
df2XcxcdE1A13,,,  preset called a perspective contrasting
df2XcxcdE1A13,,,  left which is under perspective so click
df2XcxcdE1A14,4.06,4.21,  on that one and you can see a 3d
df2XcxcdE1A14,,,  perspective applied to the wall now the
df2XcxcdE1A14,,,  wall is slightly tilted in the direction
df2XcxcdE1A14,,,  that you do n't want so let me go to c 0
df2XcxcdE1A14,,,  tation and let me call it zero degree
df2XcxcdE1A14,,,  and there the wall is straight now we
df2XcxcdE1A15,4.24,4.4,  need to apply depth so that we are able
df2XcxcdE1A15,,,  to mimic a proper wall here so let me go
df2XcxcdE1A15,,,  to 3d format and the depth I am going to
df2XcxcdE1A15,,,  add is say 30 if you are not happy with
df2XcxcdE1A15,,,  the thickness of the brick you can
df2XcxcdE1A15,,,  always add 50 and the shape outline can
df2XcxcdE1A16,4.44,5,  actually be either removed to get this
df2XcxcdE1A16,,,  effect or you can go to depth and add
df2XcxcdE1A16,,,  this color for the depth so that is how
df2XcxcdE1A16,,,  it is done now to get a little more of
df2XcxcdE1A16,,,  bevel effect all you need to do is to go
df2XcxcdE1A16,,,  back once again to 3d format and you can
df2XcxcdE1A17,5.03,5.21,  apply this the front level and also the
df2XcxcdE1A17,,,  bevel for the bottom and this is this is
df2XcxcdE1A17,,,  the the brick 3d brick texture now you
df2XcxcdE1A17,,,  can apply
df2XcxcdE1A17,,,  shadow and the perspective shadow this
df2XcxcdE1A17,,,  is called a perspective diagonal upper
df2XcxcdE1A18,5.23,5.42,  right and there it is our 3d wall is
df2XcxcdE1A18,,,  complete a 3d wall is a very beautiful
df2XcxcdE1A18,,,  metaphor for obstacle and you can use it
df2XcxcdE1A18,,,  quite a lot in concept based business
df2XcxcdE1A18,,,  light let me show you some application
df2XcxcdE1A18,,,  of brick wall taken from our PowerPoint
df2XcxcdE1A19,5.45,6.01,  CEO pack this is the first example here
df2XcxcdE1A19,,,  we talk about overcoming obstacle to be
df2XcxcdE1A19,,,  number one and here you have number one
df2XcxcdE1A19,,,  behind the wall and we are able to reach
df2XcxcdE1A19,,,  beyond the wall by using a ladder so you
df2XcxcdE1A19,,,  can write your text here let me give you
df2XcxcdE1A20,6.03,6.16,  another example here here it show
df2XcxcdE1A20,,,  crossing the barrier to reach your goal
df2XcxcdE1A20,,,  and you can talk about the barrier here
df2XcxcdE1A20,,,  let me show you another example and this
df2XcxcdE1A20,,,  one is about a bridge where we talk
df2XcxcdE1A20,,,  about the current situation and the
df2XcxcdE1A21,6.18,6.32,  desired situation and the various stage
df2XcxcdE1A21,,,  of moving to the desired situation so
df2XcxcdE1A21,,,  these are some of the various way in
df2XcxcdE1A21,,,  which you can use brick wall texture in
df2XcxcdE1A21,,,  PowerPoint if you are a busy business
df2XcxcdE1A21,,,  presenter who doe n't have the time to
df2XcxcdE1A22,6.34,6.45,  create such professional looking
df2XcxcdE1A22,,,  graphic for yourself you can always
df2XcxcdE1A22,,,  take a look at our off
df2XcxcdE1A22,,,  solution like PowerPoint CEO pack
df2XcxcdE1A22,,,  volume 1 and 2 the 2 CEO pack have more
df2XcxcdE1A22,,,  than 1600 fully irritable chart and
df2XcxcdE1A23,6.48,6.59,  graphic for CEOs and busy business

df2XcxcdE1A25,,,  hope you like the tutorial on creating
df2XcxcdE1A25,,,  big brick wall texture in PowerPoint if
df2XcxcdE1A25,,,  you want to learn more such tutorial
df2XcxcdE1A25,,,  video and if you want to read some
df2XcxcdE1A25,,,  article to improve your presentation

7sLXTR9AxKg1,0.02,0.16,  the PGR 9 is the name given at aut to
7sLXTR9AxKg1,,,  the process by which doctoral student
7sLXTR9AxKg1,,,  formally propose their research project
7sLXTR9AxKg1,,,  within the first 12 month of their
7sLXTR9AxKg1,,,  candidature this process is also called
7sLXTR9AxKg1,,,  the confirmation of candidature because
7sLXTR9AxKg2,0.18,0.31,  when successfully completed the doctoral
7sLXTR9AxKg2,,,  student status move from provisional to
7sLXTR9AxKg2,,,  confirmed to complete the PG online
7sLXTR9AxKg2,,,  process each doctoral student must
7sLXTR9AxKg2,,,  submit a written research proposal of up
7sLXTR9AxKg2,,,  to 10000 word and give an oral
7sLXTR9AxKg3,0.34,0.48,  presentation in this video we 'll talk
7sLXTR9AxKg3,,,  about the oral presentation component of
7sLXTR9AxKg3,,,  the PG online you can expect to have
7sLXTR9AxKg3,,,  about 40 to 60 minute for your PG
7sLXTR9AxKg3,,,  online presentation including time for
7sLXTR9AxKg3,,,  question and answer you can use visual
7sLXTR9AxKg4,0.51,1.02,  aid in your presentation and you 'll
7sLXTR9AxKg4,,,  have an audience usually consisting of
7sLXTR9AxKg4,,,  your PG online reviewer your
7sLXTR9AxKg4,,,  supervisor colleague from your school
7sLXTR9AxKg4,,,  and faculty and pep
7sLXTR9AxKg4,,,  interested outsider bear in mind though
7sLXTR9AxKg5,1.05,1.17,  that each faculty in school handle PG
7sLXTR9AxKg5,,,  online presentation differently so the
7sLXTR9AxKg5,,,  parameter of your presentation may vary
7sLXTR9AxKg5,,,  slightly from others when you begin to
7sLXTR9AxKg5,,,  draft your PG online presentation
7sLXTR9AxKg5,,,  remember that your reviewer will have
7sLXTR9AxKg6,1.19,1.32,  all the detail in your written research
7sLXTR9AxKg6,,,  proposal instead of giving a close view
7sLXTR9AxKg6,,,  of all the detail focus on the big
7sLXTR9AxKg6,,,  picture the heading in the written PG
7sLXTR9AxKg6,,,  online proposal can guide the structure
7sLXTR9AxKg6,,,  of your presentation of these heading
7sLXTR9AxKg7,1.35,1.47,  though some will be of greater interest
7sLXTR9AxKg7,,,  to a general audience
7sLXTR9AxKg7,,,  make sure you prioritize content about
7sLXTR9AxKg7,,,  your research question research
7sLXTR9AxKg7,,,  rationale and significance relevant
7sLXTR9AxKg7,,,  literature research design and progress
7sLXTR9AxKg8,1.51,2.07,  to date you may also like to discus
7sLXTR9AxKg8,,,  your own positioning a the researcher
7sLXTR9AxKg8,,,  if this is relevant to your project the
7sLXTR9AxKg8,,,  audience should focus on you a the
7sLXTR9AxKg8,,,  presenter and author of this research so
7sLXTR9AxKg8,,,  be sure that your visual aid are n't too
7sLXTR9AxKg9,2.09,2.21,  busy aim for simple slide with
7sLXTR9AxKg9,,,  approximately
7sLXTR9AxKg9,,,  one slide every two to three minute mix
7sLXTR9AxKg9,,,  it up with text based and image based
7sLXTR9AxKg9,,,  slide and keep your text readable by
7sLXTR9AxKg9,,,  maintaining a 30 minimum font and
7sLXTR9AxKg10,2.24,2.37,  using color that remain visible even
7sLXTR9AxKg10,,,  when displayed through a projector avoid
7sLXTR9AxKg10,,,  slide which are just wall of text
7sLXTR9AxKg10,,,  because these take the audience 's
7sLXTR9AxKg10,,,  attention away from you a the presenter
7sLXTR9AxKg10,,,  when question time arrives bear in mind
7sLXTR9AxKg11,2.4,2.51,  that it 's okay if you do n't have all the
7sLXTR9AxKg11,,,  answer at this early stage in your
7sLXTR9AxKg11,,,  research the most important thing is to
7sLXTR9AxKg11,,,  show that you are open to idea and that

Ujw_21AuU5k1,0,0.13,   Everybody love a good story
Ujw_21AuU5k1,,,  and story are a great way to open a presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k1,,,  That attention is a key moment
Ujw_21AuU5k1,,,  in every presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k1,,,  A lot of people tell me though I 'm just not
Ujw_21AuU5k1,,,  a good storyteller .
Ujw_21AuU5k2,0.14,0.27,  Well I 'm going to show you a very simple recipe
Ujw_21AuU5k2,,,  that 'll help you improve .
Ujw_21AuU5k2,,,  Hello I 'm Alex Lyon and this is Communication Coach .
Ujw_21AuU5k2,,,  We 're here to help you increase your impact
Ujw_21AuU5k2,,,  to lead your team to higher level of excellence
Ujw_21AuU5k3,0.31,0.43,  and presentation are a really important part
Ujw_21AuU5k3,,,  of your leadership and the attention
Ujw_21AuU5k3,,,  that first part of the open of your presentation
Ujw_21AuU5k3,,,  is critical to gain your audience 's interest
Ujw_21AuU5k3,,,  and story are a great way to do that
Ujw_21AuU5k3,,,  so let 's unpack this a little bit .
Ujw_21AuU5k4,0.45,0.57,  First your story have to be concise .
Ujw_21AuU5k4,,,  That mean about 60 second maybe even 30 second
Ujw_21AuU5k4,,,  for a shorter presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k4,,,  You do n't want to get long
Ujw_21AuU5k4,,,  the first thing out of your mouth in a presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k4,,,  So keep it tight and that may take
Ujw_21AuU5k5,0.58,1.1,  a few repetition through the story
Ujw_21AuU5k5,,,  a you 're practicing to pare it down to the bare essential .
Ujw_21AuU5k5,,,  To next tip is to make sure you follow
Ujw_21AuU5k5,,,  the classic story format .
Ujw_21AuU5k5,,,  There 's like a little template that you can follow
Ujw_21AuU5k5,,,  to make sure you 're telling what sound like a story .
Ujw_21AuU5k6,1.13,1.25,  Every story ha for example a beginning middle and ending .
Ujw_21AuU5k6,,,  The beginning is really simple .
Ujw_21AuU5k6,,,  You can do it in about once sentence
Ujw_21AuU5k6,,,  and that 's where you establish the time
Ujw_21AuU5k6,,,  the people and the place or setting .
Ujw_21AuU5k6,,,  So it sound a little bit like this .
Ujw_21AuU5k7,1.27,1.38,  Several year ago my brother wa hanging out
Ujw_21AuU5k7,,,  in the garage with his young son
Ujw_21AuU5k7,,,  working on their motorcycle .
Ujw_21AuU5k7,,,  So that just told you the time several year ago
Ujw_21AuU5k7,,,  the people my brother and his son
Ujw_21AuU5k7,,,  and the context or the place the garage .
Ujw_21AuU5k8,1.41,1.52,  Next you move to the body of the presentation
Ujw_21AuU5k8,,,  and that 's where all the action take place .
Ujw_21AuU5k8,,,  That 's where you build up to a climactic event .
Ujw_21AuU5k8,,,  Here 's an example .
Ujw_21AuU5k8,,,  They were hanging out in the garage
Ujw_21AuU5k8,,,  working on their motorcycle handing tool
Ujw_21AuU5k9,1.54,2.07,  back and forth and at one moment his young son
Ujw_21AuU5k9,,,  turned to my brother and said dad am I small for seven ?
Ujw_21AuU5k9,,,  My brother turned to him and said
Ujw_21AuU5k9,,,  buddy why would you say that ?
Ujw_21AuU5k9,,,  He said because the kid at school
Ujw_21AuU5k9,,,  were calling me a shrimp .
Ujw_21AuU5k10,2.1,2.18,  By the time you get to that line
Ujw_21AuU5k10,,,  the kid at school are calling me a shrimp
Ujw_21AuU5k10,,,  you have reached the climactic moment of that story
Ujw_21AuU5k10,,,  the high emotional point .
Ujw_21AuU5k10,,,  The whole reason you 're telling the story
Ujw_21AuU5k10,,,  is to get to that moment so you have to figure out
Ujw_21AuU5k11,2.2,2.32,  what your climactic event is in the story
Ujw_21AuU5k11,,,  and get there within a couple of move .
Ujw_21AuU5k11,,,  The next part is the ending or the resolution .
Ujw_21AuU5k11,,,  This is where you have to bring everything to a close
Ujw_21AuU5k11,,,  'cause you left them on the cliff there
Ujw_21AuU5k11,,,  with the climactic event .
Ujw_21AuU5k12,2.34,2.47,  It sound a little bit like this for this story .
Ujw_21AuU5k12,,,  My brother leaned in and looked him in the eye and said
Ujw_21AuU5k12,,,  buddy you are just perfect for seven .
Ujw_21AuU5k12,,,  The doctor said so himself at our last visit
Ujw_21AuU5k12,,,  and I know that you 're gon na continue to grow
Ujw_21AuU5k12,,,  into a strong and healthy young man .
Ujw_21AuU5k13,2.51,3.02,  Period .
Ujw_21AuU5k13,,,  That 's the resolution the ending to the story .
Ujw_21AuU5k13,,,  Beginning middle and end and if we squashed it
Ujw_21AuU5k13,,,  all together the story would be
Ujw_21AuU5k13,,,  between 30 and 60 second .
Ujw_21AuU5k13,,,  Now there 's a hidden fourth point in every story .
Ujw_21AuU5k14,3.04,3.15,  It 's the moral to the story the lesson learned .
Ujw_21AuU5k14,,,  The whole reason you 're telling the story
Ujw_21AuU5k14,,,  is to drive to the heart
Ujw_21AuU5k14,,,  of the message of your presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k14,,,  That 's why we tell a story to draw their interest
Ujw_21AuU5k14,,,  into the heart of the message .
Ujw_21AuU5k15,3.16,3.25,  You do n't want to tell some unrelated story
Ujw_21AuU5k15,,,  just 'cause it 's funny or it 's a nice story .
Ujw_21AuU5k15,,,  It ha to go to the central idea
Ujw_21AuU5k15,,,  that you 're gon na express in the presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k15,,,  You can express this moral directly
Ujw_21AuU5k15,,,  or it can come out in the flow of the introduction .
Ujw_21AuU5k16,3.28,3.36,  That 's up to you .
Ujw_21AuU5k16,,,  I personally like to come at the moral to the story
Ujw_21AuU5k16,,,  in a little bit of a subtle way .
Ujw_21AuU5k16,,,  I do n't like to state it directly .
Ujw_21AuU5k16,,,  It sound a little bit like I 'm trying to teach them
Ujw_21AuU5k16,,,  the lesson learned too soon .
Ujw_21AuU5k17,3.38,3.49,  It 'll come out in the rest of the presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k17,,,  One of the great technique when you 're sharing
Ujw_21AuU5k17,,,  an attention though is leave a little bit
Ujw_21AuU5k17,,,  for example the resolution of the story
Ujw_21AuU5k17,,,  for the ending of the presentation your closing
Ujw_21AuU5k17,,,  your clencher the very last thing you do .
Ujw_21AuU5k18,3.51,4.02,  This is very satisfying .
Ujw_21AuU5k18,,,  I talk about this in another video
Ujw_21AuU5k18,,,  called How To Open and Close a Presentation
Ujw_21AuU5k18,,,  and it 's where you tell most of the story here
Ujw_21AuU5k18,,,  and then you tell your whole presentation
Ujw_21AuU5k18,,,  and then you remind u of what you 're saying earlier
Ujw_21AuU5k19,4.04,4.14,  and finish it off .
Ujw_21AuU5k19,,,  So I 'll give you an example here
Ujw_21AuU5k19,,,  where I tell most of it and then I break it
Ujw_21AuU5k19,,,  right after the climactic event .
Ujw_21AuU5k19,,,  Many year ago I wa hanging out on campus
Ujw_21AuU5k19,,,  and I saw this beautiful woman standing there .
Ujw_21AuU5k20,4.18,4.29,  Over the next few week I tried to get to know her
Ujw_21AuU5k20,,,  and made some small talk and finally got up the gut
Ujw_21AuU5k20,,,  to ask her out .
Ujw_21AuU5k20,,,  She looked me straight in the eye
Ujw_21AuU5k20,,,  and with a huge smile said no thanks I 'm not interested .
Ujw_21AuU5k20,,,  And then she zipped her mouth .
Ujw_21AuU5k21,4.33,4.45,  I wa devastated .
Ujw_21AuU5k21,,,  See that 's the climactic event there .
Ujw_21AuU5k21,,,  She 's rejected me and then that 's all .
Ujw_21AuU5k21,,,  She gave me no wiggle room whatsoever .
Ujw_21AuU5k21,,,  So let 's say now I 'm telling a story
Ujw_21AuU5k21,,,  I 'm telling a presentation about perseverance
Ujw_21AuU5k22,4.48,5,  or relationship or rejection or taking risk
Ujw_21AuU5k22,,,  whatever the topic is for that particular presentation .
Ujw_21AuU5k22,,,  I tell my whole introduction all the body point
Ujw_21AuU5k22,,,  I say in conclusion and I wrap thing up
Ujw_21AuU5k22,,,  and there 's this one final moment
Ujw_21AuU5k22,,,  called the closing or the clencher .
Ujw_21AuU5k23,5.02,5.11,  And I can bring the story back around
Ujw_21AuU5k23,,,  reminding people that I shared it earlier
Ujw_21AuU5k23,,,  and then give them the resolution .
Ujw_21AuU5k23,,,  It 's a very satisfying prize .
Ujw_21AuU5k23,,,  They love it .
Ujw_21AuU5k23,,,  So it sounded a little bit like this .
Ujw_21AuU5k24,5.13,5.28,  Well even though I wa rejected
Ujw_21AuU5k24,,,  by that beautiful woman in the student union
Ujw_21AuU5k24,,,  many year ago she finally did go on a date with me
Ujw_21AuU5k24,,,  and 15 year later I am still proud to call her my wife .
Ujw_21AuU5k24,,,  That by the way is a true story
Ujw_21AuU5k24,,,  and I love it because it ha this natural element
Ujw_21AuU5k25,5.32,5.4,  where you feel like you 've got most of the story
Ujw_21AuU5k25,,,  but then there 's a little bit more to it .
Ujw_21AuU5k25,,,  So if you have a story like that but you can break
Ujw_21AuU5k25,,,  in a nice spot and bring it back around
Ujw_21AuU5k25,,,  it 's very satisfying .
Ujw_21AuU5k25,,,  As you can tell the story should come
Ujw_21AuU5k26,5.43,5.52,  from some relatively predictable source .
Ujw_21AuU5k26,,,  Your own life .
Ujw_21AuU5k26,,,  The people in the life around you with permission .
Ujw_21AuU5k26,,,  You do n't want to just tell story
Ujw_21AuU5k26,,,  without asking permission .
Ujw_21AuU5k26,,,  You may read biography and thing like that
Ujw_21AuU5k27,5.54,6.02,  and gain story from that .
Ujw_21AuU5k27,,,  One of the thing I recommend against however
Ujw_21AuU5k27,,,  is taking story from other speaker
Ujw_21AuU5k27,,,  that they 're already telling or other author
Ujw_21AuU5k27,,,  that they 're already telling .
Ujw_21AuU5k27,,,  You want your story to be fresh and original .
Ujw_21AuU5k28,6.04,6.16,  It 's gon na be way more impactful .
Ujw_21AuU5k28,,,  So question of the day what are your tip
Ujw_21AuU5k28,,,  for telling great story ?
Ujw_21AuU5k28,,,  I would love to hear your comment in that section below .
Ujw_21AuU5k28,,,  So thanks God bless and I hope you tell
Ujw_21AuU5k28,,,  a great story in your next presentation .

dXWRPWcxvGU3,,,  speaker is important but the audience is an even higher
dXWRPWcxvGU4,1.08,1.25,  priority especially given the desire for human
dXWRPWcxvGU4,,,  connection in a virtual setting they need to have a reason to listen
dXWRPWcxvGU4,,,  what are they going to get out of the experience
dXWRPWcxvGU4,,,  they need to understand why the next speaker is the authority
dXWRPWcxvGU4,,,  and why it 's important to hear this message now for year i 've tested
dXWRPWcxvGU4,,,  different way to set speaker up for success a
dXWRPWcxvGU5,1.28,1.46,  the host and mc on television show leadership
dXWRPWcxvGU5,,,  conference and for several year a the host of
dXWRPWcxvGU5,,,  tedx vancouver the next time you are asked to introduce
dXWRPWcxvGU5,,,  a guest speaker consider this proven four formula
dXWRPWcxvGU5,,,  a host you want to efficiently establish credibility
dXWRPWcxvGU5,,,  this build trust with the audience that the speaker they are about to listen to
dXWRPWcxvGU6,1.5,2.07,  is the authority on the topic being covered here 's where you can briefly
dXWRPWcxvGU6,,,  infuse bio point to accomplish this while
dXWRPWcxvGU6,,,  still captivating your audience with some type
dXWRPWcxvGU6,,,  of story once again this wa an example at a
dXWRPWcxvGU6,,,  previous tedx vancouver showcase and the intro wa for a popular doctor
dXWRPWcxvGU6,,,  our next speaker is a neuroscientist and physical therapist that study how
dXWRPWcxvGU7,2.12,2.32,  human behavior ha the power to change life what make
dXWRPWcxvGU7,,,  her feel relevant it wa a defining experience when she
dXWRPWcxvGU7,,,  started her work a a physical therapist she worked with a young man with a
dXWRPWcxvGU7,,,  severe brain injury and despite her best effort she could
dXWRPWcxvGU7,,,  not help him recover realizing she did n't know enough about
dXWRPWcxvGU7,,,  the brain she then quit her job to return to
dXWRPWcxvGU8,2.35,2.58,  school for her phd in neuroscience this led her to her current journey here

dXWRPWcxvGU9,3.01,3.2,  by the way her ted talk your brain will not be the same
dXWRPWcxvGU9,,,  is awesome and it 's popular it 's got 27 million view
dXWRPWcxvGU9,,,  if you a the mc want to captivate your audience with the introduction
dXWRPWcxvGU9,,,  start here minimize the use of the speaker 's basic bio point
dXWRPWcxvGU9,,,  the audience can find that information on a website or event program
dXWRPWcxvGU9,,,  your goal is to humanize the speaker by finding the story that connects the
dXWRPWcxvGU10,3.24,3.41,  event 's theme to the audience 's need how do you find
dXWRPWcxvGU10,,,  the right story well reach out to the speaker or
dXWRPWcxvGU10,,,  speaker beforehand if there are multiple speaker you can
dXWRPWcxvGU10,,,  ask them all the same question and then create a constant thread with your
dXWRPWcxvGU10,,,  introduction that delivers a fun narrative now
dXWRPWcxvGU10,,,  directly connecting with the speaker ensures two thing one you 're telling a
dXWRPWcxvGU11,3.45,4.04,  story that is impactful but two you do n't take away from the
dXWRPWcxvGU11,,,  content that speaker might be delivering in their presentation now here 's an
dXWRPWcxvGU11,,,  example of an introduction that wa used during a
dXWRPWcxvGU11,,,  previous tedx vancouver showcase the theme of the showcase identity and i
dXWRPWcxvGU11,,,  reached out to all of the speaker and asked them
dXWRPWcxvGU11,,,  one question what make you feel relevant
dXWRPWcxvGU12,4.08,4.26,  then i asked them to tell me the story of the conversation when they realized
dXWRPWcxvGU12,,,  their true identity now this wa a fun example for
dXWRPWcxvGU12,,,  all of the speaker but one in particular wa speaker scott jones who
dXWRPWcxvGU12,,,  is a friend from the tv industry and his intro went like this
dXWRPWcxvGU12,,,  our next speaker is a tv host and digital medium thought leader whose

dXWRPWcxvGU15,,,  a host efficiently build that speaker up and then
dXWRPWcxvGU15,,,  let the speaker hit the ground running you want to try and land
dXWRPWcxvGU15,,,  your intro time around 30 to 45 second so you can create anticipation
dXWRPWcxvGU15,,,  and leave the audience wanting more remember brevity

dXWRPWcxvGU16,5.4,6,  with their full name a soon a the audience hears the speaker 's full name
dXWRPWcxvGU16,,,  it 's almost instinctual they will begin their welcoming applause
dXWRPWcxvGU16,,,  this is a common trap in introduction where host say the speaker 's full name
dXWRPWcxvGU16,,,  and they still have about three or four more line to read make the
dXWRPWcxvGU16,,,  speaker 's full name the last thing you read in the
dXWRPWcxvGU16,,,  introduction it 's a easy a working through the personalized intro and then
dXWRPWcxvGU17,6.03,6.22,  having your last line be please welcome and then say their first

KVbRQ0cE0Ok2,,,  PowerPoint presentation a video clip a
KVbRQ0cE0Ok2,,,  handout an artifact or even some sort of
KVbRQ0cE0Ok2,,,  prop that you bring to class for most
KVbRQ0cE0Ok3,0.43,0.57,  public speaking class you will be
KVbRQ0cE0Ok3,,,  required to bring a photo or some sort
KVbRQ0cE0Ok3,,,  of digital presentation these visual
KVbRQ0cE0Ok3,,,  aid will be used in conjunction with
KVbRQ0cE0Ok3,,,  your speech in order to better inform
KVbRQ0cE0Ok3,,,  persuade or entertain your audience here
KVbRQ0cE0Ok4,1.01,1.16,  are five basic point for using visual
KVbRQ0cE0Ok4,,,  aid one plan or write your speech
KVbRQ0cE0Ok4,,,  before finding your visual aid your
KVbRQ0cE0Ok4,,,  speech should not be centered on your
KVbRQ0cE0Ok4,,,  visual aid you should have a cohesive
KVbRQ0cE0Ok4,,,  effective speech that ha been enhanced
KVbRQ0cE0Ok5,1.19,1.36,  by the use of your visual aid to make
KVbRQ0cE0Ok5,,,  sure that your visual aid are assisting
KVbRQ0cE0Ok5,,,  and accomplishing the purpose of your
KVbRQ0cE0Ok5,,,  speech they should help to clarify
KVbRQ0cE0Ok5,,,  provide information or to persuade make
KVbRQ0cE0Ok5,,,  sure that your visual aid
KVbRQ0cE0Ok6,1.37,1.53,  are helping with your presentation not
KVbRQ0cE0Ok6,,,  distracting from what you are saying 3
KVbRQ0cE0Ok6,,,  make sure your visual aid are visible
KVbRQ0cE0Ok6,,,  to the entire audience your visual aid
KVbRQ0cE0Ok6,,,  should be big enough and also should be
KVbRQ0cE0Ok6,,,  clear enough for everyone in the
KVbRQ0cE0Ok7,1.56,2.13,  audience to be able to see
KVbRQ0cE0Ok7,,,  easily for practice with your visual
KVbRQ0cE0Ok7,,,  aid at any time it is so easy to be
KVbRQ0cE0Ok7,,,  clumsy and awkward with visual aid so
KVbRQ0cE0Ok7,,,  here are some step to practicing with
KVbRQ0cE0Ok7,,,  your visual aid ahead of time one thing
KVbRQ0cE0Ok8,2.15,2.27,  to keep in mind is not to stand in front
KVbRQ0cE0Ok8,,,  of your visual aid if you 're standing in
KVbRQ0cE0Ok8,,,  front of the visual aid you 're blocking
KVbRQ0cE0Ok8,,,  someone from being able to see what you
KVbRQ0cE0Ok8,,,  are presenting also do n't show your
KVbRQ0cE0Ok8,,,  visual aid for the entirety of your
KVbRQ0cE0Ok9,2.29,2.42,  speech pick out certain point during
KVbRQ0cE0Ok9,,,  your speech that would make sense to
KVbRQ0cE0Ok9,,,  have your visual aid being displayed and
KVbRQ0cE0Ok9,,,  only show your visual aid during that
KVbRQ0cE0Ok9,,,  specific part and then put it away one
KVbRQ0cE0Ok9,,,  way you can do this is by putting a
KVbRQ0cE0Ok10,2.44,2.58,  blank slide in between your photo in
KVbRQ0cE0Ok10,,,  your digital presentation so if you have
KVbRQ0cE0Ok10,,,  a photo that 's displaying what you 're
KVbRQ0cE0Ok10,,,  talking about you can refer to it and
KVbRQ0cE0Ok10,,,  then click it to the next slide and have
KVbRQ0cE0Ok10,,,  it be a blank slide so it 's not
KVbRQ0cE0Ok11,3,3.15,  distracting step 5
KVbRQ0cE0Ok11,,,  have a back plan thing happen all
KVbRQ0cE0Ok11,,,  the time especially on important day
KVbRQ0cE0Ok11,,,  like when you need to be giving a speech
KVbRQ0cE0Ok11,,,  technology fails u so you need to have
KVbRQ0cE0Ok11,,,  a backup just in case the way to do this
KVbRQ0cE0Ok12,3.18,3.34,  is have multiple way of accessing your
KVbRQ0cE0Ok12,,,  presentation if you have a Prezi or a
KVbRQ0cE0Ok12,,,  PowerPoint have it saved in multiple
KVbRQ0cE0Ok12,,,  location be able to access it off of
KVbRQ0cE0Ok12,,,  the Internet another thing to do is to
KVbRQ0cE0Ok12,,,  prepare yourself in case your technology
KVbRQ0cE0Ok14,3.36,4.01,  or anything doe not work in the moment
KVbRQ0cE0Ok14,,,  what are you going to do when you are
KVbRQ0cE0Ok14,,,  giving your speech and you ca n't access
KVbRQ0cE0Ok14,,,  the photo that you are going to refer to
KVbRQ0cE0Ok14,,,  plan ahead so you do n't get freaked out

WHH8Gx0u9Is3,,,  and shape fill use some nice color and
WHH8Gx0u9Is4,1.07,1.26,  shape outline make it white color and
WHH8Gx0u9Is4,,,  increase the weight to this one and
WHH8Gx0u9Is4,,,  press control D to duplicate I am going
WHH8Gx0u9Is4,,,  to add another symbol for the decision
WHH8Gx0u9Is4,,,  and to change the symbol go to format
WHH8Gx0u9Is4,,,  edit shape change shape and for the
WHH8Gx0u9Is5,1.3,1.44,  decision the symbol is this one you can
WHH8Gx0u9Is5,,,  see under flowchart this is the
WHH8Gx0u9Is5,,,  flowchart decision I 'll just click that
WHH8Gx0u9Is5,,,  one increase the size a little bit more
WHH8Gx0u9Is5,,,  and then press control D I am going to
WHH8Gx0u9Is5,,,  create three process here and the
WHH8Gx0u9Is6,1.47,2.05,  symbol for the process is this one you
WHH8Gx0u9Is6,,,  can go to edit shape you can see here
WHH8Gx0u9Is6,,,  this is a alternate process or you can
WHH8Gx0u9Is6,,,  use any of this click that one increase
WHH8Gx0u9Is6,,,  the size and reduce the width press
WHH8Gx0u9Is6,,,  control D so this is the second one and
WHH8Gx0u9Is7,2.09,2.27,  ctrl D is a third one and make sure that
WHH8Gx0u9Is7,,,  this is aligned properly and it 's
WHH8Gx0u9Is7,,,  vertical also properly and once this is
WHH8Gx0u9Is7,,,  done I 'm going to press control D for
WHH8Gx0u9Is7,,,  this to duplicate and here I am going to
WHH8Gx0u9Is7,,,  add another
WHH8Gx0u9Is8,2.28,2.42,  cymbal which is if you want you can just
WHH8Gx0u9Is8,,,  see here you have got a variety of and
WHH8Gx0u9Is8,,,  for example say this one a flowchart our
WHH8Gx0u9Is8,,,  data here I 'll just click so it change
WHH8Gx0u9Is8,,,  to this one and the last one is the end
WHH8Gx0u9Is8,,,  I 'm just going to select this this is
WHH8Gx0u9Is9,2.45,2.58,  start and this is the end and put it
WHH8Gx0u9Is9,,,  here so you can see here our basic
WHH8Gx0u9Is9,,,  design is ready then I 'm going to add
WHH8Gx0u9Is9,,,  the arrow to add the arrow go to
WHH8Gx0u9Is9,,,  insert shape and select any arrow here
WHH8Gx0u9Is9,,,  the line and just draw a straight line
WHH8Gx0u9Is10,3.01,3.17,  here straight arrow you can see here and
WHH8Gx0u9Is10,,,  I 'm just going to view or remove the
WHH8Gx0u9Is10,,,  guide and right mouse click go to
WHH8Gx0u9Is10,,,  format shape and you can change the
WHH8Gx0u9Is10,,,  color for example I 'm going to use
WHH8Gx0u9Is10,,,  orange color and increase the width you
WHH8Gx0u9Is11,3.21,3.37,  can see here the arrow and then I 'm
WHH8Gx0u9Is11,,,  going to end arrow type I need something
WHH8Gx0u9Is11,,,  like this and end arrow size which is a
WHH8Gx0u9Is11,,,  bigger one so we got this one and then
WHH8Gx0u9Is11,,,  I 'm going to add the arrow from the
WHH8Gx0u9Is11,,,  decision to the three process for that
WHH8Gx0u9Is12,3.4,3.58,  select arrow press control D and bring
WHH8Gx0u9Is12,,,  the arrow here and one more arrow here
WHH8Gx0u9Is12,,,  but here I need a different arrow here
WHH8Gx0u9Is12,,,  for that right mouse click you can
WHH8Gx0u9Is12,,,  change the connector type to connector
WHH8Gx0u9Is12,,,  elbow and you 'll get this particular
WHH8Gx0u9Is13,4.01,4.24,  arrow and then I 'm just going to ctrl D
WHH8Gx0u9Is13,,,  to duplicate it put it here and put it
WHH8Gx0u9Is13,,,  here one more and then I 'm just going to
WHH8Gx0u9Is13,,,  copy this ctrl D and put it here and
WHH8Gx0u9Is13,,,  then I 'm going to add the same arrow
WHH8Gx0u9Is13,,,  ctrl D one hand will be this side which
WHH8Gx0u9Is14,4.29,4.49,  is going to the data part and again
WHH8Gx0u9Is14,,,  control D one end is here the other and
WHH8Gx0u9Is14,,,  I 'm just dragging it here and again one
WHH8Gx0u9Is14,,,  more arrow control
WHH8Gx0u9Is14,,,  d reduce the size and put it here and
WHH8Gx0u9Is14,,,  control D one more arrow which is going
WHH8Gx0u9Is15,4.53,5.18,  from this to this so you can see here
WHH8Gx0u9Is15,,,  our design is over we have to just add
WHH8Gx0u9Is15,,,  the text now to add the text go to
WHH8Gx0u9Is15,,,  insert text box and type it here start
WHH8Gx0u9Is15,,,  make it white century gothic make it
WHH8Gx0u9Is15,,,  bold and reduce the size to 14 Center
WHH8Gx0u9Is16,5.21,5.35,  align and put it here
WHH8Gx0u9Is16,,,  and similarly you can add the text to
WHH8Gx0u9Is16,,,  all other symbol so you can see here I
WHH8Gx0u9Is16,,,  have added the text decision process 1
WHH8Gx0u9Is16,,,  process to process 3 and then the action
WHH8Gx0u9Is16,,,  and the end so this is the simplest way
WHH8Gx0u9Is17,5.38,6.01,  you can create the process flow diagram
WHH8Gx0u9Is17,,,  that 's it from me friend thank you for

k4dEKe6OMWw1,0,0.14,  ready to take your infographics to a
k4dEKe6OMWw1,,,  completely different level
k4dEKe6OMWw1,,,  animation can take you there and visme
k4dEKe6OMWw1,,,  can help
k4dEKe6OMWw1,,,  on this very youtube channel we 've
k4dEKe6OMWw1,,,  discussed building infographics for
k4dEKe6OMWw2,0.16,0.25,  quite some time now i could read off
k4dEKe6OMWw2,,,  reason after reason
k4dEKe6OMWw2,,,  after reason a to why you should be
k4dEKe6OMWw2,,,  building infographics
k4dEKe6OMWw2,,,  to display your information if you 've
k4dEKe6OMWw2,,,  been listening and following suit
k4dEKe6OMWw3,0.26,0.39,  well excellent but now i want to make
k4dEKe6OMWw3,,,  sure you 're taking advantage of the
k4dEKe6OMWw3,,,  tool that vizmi provides and
k4dEKe6OMWw3,,,  few others do that is animation within
k4dEKe6OMWw3,,,  your infographic hello world i 'm mike
k4dEKe6OMWw3,,,  plogger and i 'm here with vizme to help
k4dEKe6OMWw4,0.4,0.48,  you
k4dEKe6OMWw4,,,  blow away your audience with custom
k4dEKe6OMWw4,,,  animation
k4dEKe6OMWw4,,,  built for your infographics in this
k4dEKe6OMWw4,,,  video we 'll dive into the various
k4dEKe6OMWw4,,,  animation you can implement
k4dEKe6OMWw5,0.5,1,  and edit into your infographics right
k4dEKe6OMWw5,,,  now
k4dEKe6OMWw5,,,  there 's no expensive cost no stressful
k4dEKe6OMWw5,,,  creative thinking
k4dEKe6OMWw5,,,  just you and visme together a one
k4dEKe6OMWw5,,,  shall we
k4dEKe6OMWw6,1.05,1.13,  first thing first and that 's just
k4dEKe6OMWw6,,,  getting started often that 's the most
k4dEKe6OMWw6,,,  difficult part for
k4dEKe6OMWw6,,,  all of u taking that first step can be
k4dEKe6OMWw6,,,  scary but
k4dEKe6OMWw6,,,  rest assured that visby 's platform is
k4dEKe6OMWw7,1.15,1.26,  built to make your life
k4dEKe6OMWw7,,,  easier once you 've found a fitting
k4dEKe6OMWw7,,,  template from visumi 's vast selection
k4dEKe6OMWw7,,,  and adjusted the text
k4dEKe6OMWw7,,,  to fit your purpose click on graphic
k4dEKe6OMWw7,,,  in the far
k4dEKe6OMWw8,1.26,1.41,  left toolbar and scroll down slightly to
k4dEKe6OMWw8,,,  animated graphic
k4dEKe6OMWw8,,,  the first option you 'll see is
k4dEKe6OMWw8,,,  illustration once you click on that
k4dEKe6OMWw8,,,  10 different category of more than 300
k4dEKe6OMWw8,,,  animated illustration will appear
k4dEKe6OMWw9,1.44,1.55,  everything from finance to sport to
k4dEKe6OMWw9,,,  real estate or science vismy 's thought
k4dEKe6OMWw9,,,  of it all
k4dEKe6OMWw9,,,  consider your purpose let 's say for this
k4dEKe6OMWw9,,,  example your infographic is all about
k4dEKe6OMWw9,,,  going green and helping the environment
k4dEKe6OMWw10,1.57,2.07,  we click on that category and find three
k4dEKe6OMWw10,,,  more
k4dEKe6OMWw10,,,  with each category you 'll have three
k4dEKe6OMWw10,,,  option flat
k4dEKe6OMWw10,,,  outline or isometric flat is a it
k4dEKe6OMWw10,,,  sound
k4dEKe6OMWw11,2.08,2.17,  the 2d animation appear a if they 've
k4dEKe6OMWw11,,,  been placed on a page from a straight on
k4dEKe6OMWw11,,,  view you 'll find a lot of the same
k4dEKe6OMWw11,,,  design in outline
k4dEKe6OMWw11,,,  but they wo n't be filled in with color
k4dEKe6OMWw11,,,  you can actually choose one of the
k4dEKe6OMWw12,2.19,2.28,  outline
k4dEKe6OMWw12,,,  and edit the color a you see fit
k4dEKe6OMWw12,,,  either with a pre palette
k4dEKe6OMWw12,,,  or with your very own creation and the
k4dEKe6OMWw12,,,  last category is
k4dEKe6OMWw12,,,  isometric these appear to pop off the
k4dEKe6OMWw13,2.3,2.42,  page in a 3d type of way
k4dEKe6OMWw13,,,  it 's a if the viewer is looking down on
k4dEKe6OMWw13,,,  the graphic from an angle
k4dEKe6OMWw13,,,  rather than from straight on
k4dEKe6OMWw13,,,  another way to use animation in your
k4dEKe6OMWw13,,,  infographics is through character
k4dEKe6OMWw14,2.45,2.54,  whether it 's people mascot or even
k4dEKe6OMWw14,,,  robot
k4dEKe6OMWw14,,,  these animation can really bring an
k4dEKe6OMWw14,,,  infographic to life
k4dEKe6OMWw14,,,  visme ha over 50 character you can use
k4dEKe6OMWw14,,,  in an infographic or really any design
k4dEKe6OMWw15,2.57,3.05,  right now let 's say you work in
k4dEKe6OMWw15,,,  healthcare go to the professional tab
k4dEKe6OMWw15,,,  scroll down and you 'll find a doctor
k4dEKe6OMWw15,,,  when you first put him in the
k4dEKe6OMWw15,,,  infographic
k4dEKe6OMWw15,,,  he 'll kindly wave back to you a if he 's
k4dEKe6OMWw16,3.07,3.15,  thanking you for bringing him
k4dEKe6OMWw16,,,  to life but if you do n't like that way
k4dEKe6OMWw16,,,  for your purpose
k4dEKe6OMWw16,,,  there 's a variety of other pose that
k4dEKe6OMWw16,,,  you can choose from
k4dEKe6OMWw16,,,  maybe you want him pointing to text or
k4dEKe6OMWw17,3.18,3.26,  coming up with a good idea
k4dEKe6OMWw17,,,  or maybe even giving two thumb up a if
k4dEKe6OMWw17,,,  he 's telling
k4dEKe6OMWw17,,,  a patient that you 're good to go you can
k4dEKe6OMWw17,,,  even adjust
k4dEKe6OMWw17,,,  how many time he or she repeat in
k4dEKe6OMWw18,3.28,3.42,  action and how quickly they do so
k4dEKe6OMWw18,,,  your wish is their command
k4dEKe6OMWw18,,,  if you 're looking for a way to draw
k4dEKe6OMWw18,,,  attention to a piece of text or a chart
k4dEKe6OMWw18,,,  gesture might be just what you 're
k4dEKe6OMWw18,,,  looking for you can have gesture with
k4dEKe6OMWw19,3.44,3.53,  or without object or
k4dEKe6OMWw19,,,  gesture that encourage interaction the
k4dEKe6OMWw19,,,  first two category are
k4dEKe6OMWw19,,,  great for pointing a viewer 's eye
k4dEKe6OMWw19,,,  towards a vital
k4dEKe6OMWw19,,,  piece of the graphic if there 's
k4dEKe6OMWw20,3.55,4.04,  something that your audience must see
k4dEKe6OMWw20,,,  use these interaction can be used for a
k4dEKe6OMWw20,,,  wide range of purpose
k4dEKe6OMWw20,,,  hand can shake they can give high five
k4dEKe6OMWw20,,,  give thumb up or thumb down
k4dEKe6OMWw20,,,  or you can even make a heart with two
k4dEKe6OMWw21,4.06,4.16,  hand coming
k4dEKe6OMWw21,,,  together keep in mind all of the same
k4dEKe6OMWw21,,,  setting that we 've talked about with
k4dEKe6OMWw21,,,  other animation apply here a well any
k4dEKe6OMWw21,,,  illustration
k4dEKe6OMWw21,,,  character or gesture color can be
k4dEKe6OMWw22,4.18,4.32,  changed within
k4dEKe6OMWw22,,,  the dashboard to fit your need do n't
k4dEKe6OMWw22,,,  let the default color scare you away
k4dEKe6OMWw22,,,  from the animation design itself
k4dEKe6OMWw22,,,  oh special effect you love them in
k4dEKe6OMWw22,,,  movie and you may not have known how
k4dEKe6OMWw23,4.34,4.42,  much you love them in your infographics
k4dEKe6OMWw23,,,  mail opening in firework and symbol oh
k4dEKe6OMWw23,,,  my
k4dEKe6OMWw23,,,  there 's six category you can choose
k4dEKe6OMWw23,,,  from all very
k4dEKe6OMWw23,,,  very different if you have something in
k4dEKe6OMWw24,4.44,4.53,  mind just type it in the search bar to
k4dEKe6OMWw24,,,  save you some time this is a good time
k4dEKe6OMWw24,,,  to point out the animate tab in the
k4dEKe6OMWw24,,,  upper right portion
k4dEKe6OMWw24,,,  of the page if you have n't explored
k4dEKe6OMWw24,,,  already this tab allows you to
k4dEKe6OMWw25,4.55,5.03,  manipulate the
k4dEKe6OMWw25,,,  movement of your animation you can
k4dEKe6OMWw25,,,  adjust how they enter and exit your
k4dEKe6OMWw25,,,  design
k4dEKe6OMWw25,,,  whether it 's a fade or spin into sight
k4dEKe6OMWw25,,,  or maybe
k4dEKe6OMWw26,5.04,5.13,  bounce to a landing it 's all entirely
k4dEKe6OMWw26,,,  up to you
k4dEKe6OMWw26,,,  have some fun with it and see what you
k4dEKe6OMWw26,,,  like best however
k4dEKe6OMWw26,,,  i will say it 's important to note that
k4dEKe6OMWw26,,,  you do n't want to overwhelm your viewer
k4dEKe6OMWw27,5.14,5.26,  with
k4dEKe6OMWw27,,,  too many animation type stick to one or
k4dEKe6OMWw27,,,  two throughout your infographic to keep
k4dEKe6OMWw27,,,  it clutter free
k4dEKe6OMWw27,,,  while vismi ha offered static icon for
k4dEKe6OMWw27,,,  a while now you can take advantage of
k4dEKe6OMWw28,5.28,5.37,  these
k4dEKe6OMWw28,,,  fun animated icon animated icon are

k4dEKe6OMWw29,,,  animating data is possible within
k4dEKe6OMWw29,,,  visme 's dashboard a well
k4dEKe6OMWw29,,,  you can create custom chart table map

k4dEKe6OMWw30,,,  favorite part
k4dEKe6OMWw30,,,  you can either input your data manually
k4dEKe6OMWw31,6.09,6.16,  or

k4dEKe6OMWw32,,,  animate there 's five option to play
k4dEKe6OMWw33,6.3,6.41,  with in order to add movement to a chart
k4dEKe6OMWw33,,,  go through each one to see which one is
k4dEKe6OMWw33,,,  best for your graphic
k4dEKe6OMWw33,,,  just be sure to use the same animation
k4dEKe6OMWw33,,,  type for multiple chart in the same
k4dEKe6OMWw33,,,  presentation
k4dEKe6OMWw34,6.42,6.56,  do n't go crazy remember keep it clean

k4dEKe6OMWw35,,,  another let me explain you can link an
k4dEKe6OMWw35,,,  animation type
k4dEKe6OMWw35,,,  let 's say a robot to text within the
k4dEKe6OMWw35,,,  design
k4dEKe6OMWw35,,,  if a viewer or the presenter scroll
k4dEKe6OMWw36,7.1,7.18,  over or click

k4dEKe6OMWw40,,,  information beautiful
Q4SCn6J4ako1,0,0.28,  today we 're going to talk about how you
Q4SCn6J4ako1,,,  can most effectively build visual note
Q4SCn6J4ako1,,,  into a presentation that you 're giving
Q4SCn6J4ako1,,,  let 's sketch it out welcome to purple to
Q4SCn6J4ako1,,,  visual video I am your host Doug Neil
Q4SCn6J4ako1,,,  and this question of how to build in
Q4SCn6J4ako2,0.32,1.04,  more visuals into a talk that you 're
Q4SCn6J4ako2,,,  giving is one of the question that I
Q4SCn6J4ako2,,,  most frequently get asked so let 's jump
Q4SCn6J4ako2,,,  right into it first up I think it 's
Q4SCn6J4ako2,,,  important to start with the takeaway in
Q4SCn6J4ako2,,,  mind and then build your presentation
Q4SCn6J4ako3,1.06,1.19,  around that takeaway by clearly defining
Q4SCn6J4ako3,,,  what you want folk to get out of any
Q4SCn6J4ako3,,,  particular presentation that you 're
Q4SCn6J4ako3,,,  giving you make it that much easier to
Q4SCn6J4ako3,,,  build your presentation in a way that
Q4SCn6J4ako3,,,  achieves that outcome
Q4SCn6J4ako4,1.24,1.44,  I have a particular goal in mind for you
Q4SCn6J4ako4,,,  with this presentation so we 're gon na
Q4SCn6J4ako4,,,  return to this first point here at the
Q4SCn6J4ako4,,,  end of the video to see if I have done a
Q4SCn6J4ako4,,,  good enough job of building up to the
Q4SCn6J4ako4,,,  takeaway another tip that I have found
Q4SCn6J4ako5,1.46,2,  to be useful is to introduce a single
Q4SCn6J4ako5,,,  idea at a time even if you 're building
Q4SCn6J4ako5,,,  up to a larger picture by introducing a
Q4SCn6J4ako5,,,  single idea at a time and building up
Q4SCn6J4ako5,,,  that big picture you make it that much
Q4SCn6J4ako5,,,  easier for the audience to follow along
Q4SCn6J4ako6,2.08,2.2,  if in contrast you started by throwing
Q4SCn6J4ako6,,,  up this big complicated diagram then you
Q4SCn6J4ako6,,,  would likely overwhelm at your audience
Q4SCn6J4ako6,,,  they 'd be looking all over the place and
Q4SCn6J4ako6,,,  probably would stop listening to what
Q4SCn6J4ako6,,,  you 're saying but when you slowly build
Q4SCn6J4ako7,2.23,2.39,  up that picture one idea at a time your
Q4SCn6J4ako7,,,  audience wo n't get lost
Q4SCn6J4ako7,,,  tip number three use a few word on the
Q4SCn6J4ako7,,,  screen a possible everyone is tired of
Q4SCn6J4ako7,,,  text slide so a you explore the
Q4SCn6J4ako7,,,  balance between visuals and word a you
Q4SCn6J4ako8,2.42,2.59,  put together your presentation see if
Q4SCn6J4ako8,,,  you can use a few word a possible and
Q4SCn6J4ako8,,,  rely more on the visuals to convey the
Q4SCn6J4ako8,,,  information
Q4SCn6J4ako8,,,  do n't forget that you have your voice to
Q4SCn6J4ako8,,,  share idea and the power of having a
Q4SCn6J4ako9,3.02,3.16,  visual on the screen is that an engaging
Q4SCn6J4ako9,,,  visual that 's connected to what you 're
Q4SCn6J4ako9,,,  saying make it easier to remember the
Q4SCn6J4ako9,,,  whole package the combination of those
Q4SCn6J4ako9,,,  thing moving forward so the next time
Q4SCn6J4ako9,,,  you have a presentation to give and you
Q4SCn6J4ako10,3.18,3.3,  want to add a visual component to your
Q4SCn6J4ako10,,,  presentation keep these three idea in
Q4SCn6J4ako10,,,  mind
Q4SCn6J4ako10,,,  start with the takeaway then build
Q4SCn6J4ako10,,,  around of that introduce one idea at a
Q4SCn6J4ako10,,,  time and use a few word on the screen
Q4SCn6J4ako11,3.33,3.46,  a possible let 's return now to that
Q4SCn6J4ako11,,,  first point to see how well I have
Q4SCn6J4ako11,,,  reached the takeaway that I have been
Q4SCn6J4ako11,,,  shooting for in this presentation my
Q4SCn6J4ako11,,,  goal is to give you enough idea about
Q4SCn6J4ako11,,,  how to build some visual note into your
Q4SCn6J4ako12,3.49,4.02,  presentation so that you feel confident
Q4SCn6J4ako12,,,  to get started doing it but not so many
Q4SCn6J4ako12,,,  idea that you feel overwhelmed so if

Q4SCn6J4ako12,,,  bit more confidence in building visual
Q4SCn6J4ako12,,,  note into your next presentation then I

17aIhDQ1k8s1,0.1,0.2,  hi
17aIhDQ1k8s1,,,  i 'm wendy from rural storytelling
17aIhDQ1k8s1,,,  project today
17aIhDQ1k8s1,,,  i 'll be going over how we can use
17aIhDQ1k8s1,,,  presentation a an aid to storytelling
17aIhDQ1k8s1,,,  and different key technical component
17aIhDQ1k8s2,0.22,0.33,  of presentation
17aIhDQ1k8s2,,,  to help do that for today we 're going to
17aIhDQ1k8s2,,,  go through some objective
17aIhDQ1k8s2,,,  the first one which would be learning
17aIhDQ1k8s2,,,  how to be an active listener and to give
17aIhDQ1k8s2,,,  feedback to our own peer
17aIhDQ1k8s3,0.35,0.44,  we 're going to also learn about how we
17aIhDQ1k8s3,,,  use presentation a an aid to tell our
17aIhDQ1k8s3,,,  own story
17aIhDQ1k8s3,,,  and lastly we 'll go over some key
17aIhDQ1k8s3,,,  technical presentation
17aIhDQ1k8s3,,,  skill on how we can effectively tell
17aIhDQ1k8s4,0.47,0.57,  our own story
17aIhDQ1k8s4,,,  there are some thing that you should
17aIhDQ1k8s4,,,  keep in mind of when you 're listening to
17aIhDQ1k8s4,,,  someone give a speech
17aIhDQ1k8s4,,,  you want to be an active listener and
17aIhDQ1k8s4,,,  that mean
17aIhDQ1k8s5,0.58,1.08,  asking question if you have any and
17aIhDQ1k8s5,,,  jotting down
17aIhDQ1k8s5,,,  what do you like about this speaker 's
17aIhDQ1k8s5,,,  story
17aIhDQ1k8s5,,,  speech what do you think can be improved
17aIhDQ1k8s5,,,  and what reaction do you have after
17aIhDQ1k8s6,1.1,1.2,  listening
17aIhDQ1k8s6,,,  to the speaker 's story speech once you
17aIhDQ1k8s6,,,  are keeping those in mind a you 're
17aIhDQ1k8s6,,,  listening
17aIhDQ1k8s6,,,  you can provide those comment and
17aIhDQ1k8s6,,,  feedback after
17aIhDQ1k8s7,1.23,1.32,  now that we know how to actively listen
17aIhDQ1k8s7,,,  and get see
17aIhDQ1k8s7,,,  back when we 're listening to someone
17aIhDQ1k8s7,,,  give a speech
17aIhDQ1k8s7,,,  we 're going to learn how we can use
17aIhDQ1k8s7,,,  presentation
17aIhDQ1k8s8,1.33,1.47,  a a way to aid storytelling
17aIhDQ1k8s8,,,  when we use presentation we can provide
17aIhDQ1k8s8,,,  visuals
17aIhDQ1k8s8,,,  and text to help guide u
17aIhDQ1k8s8,,,  through your speech and your story
17aIhDQ1k8s8,,,  because of those it becomes really
17aIhDQ1k8s9,1.5,2,  helpful
17aIhDQ1k8s9,,,  to have that to keep your audience
17aIhDQ1k8s9,,,  engaged what you 're
17aIhDQ1k8s9,,,  talking about and also help you
17aIhDQ1k8s9,,,  to guide you through your storytelling
17aIhDQ1k8s9,,,  when you have some slide to look over
17aIhDQ1k8s10,2.02,2.13,  to serve a your note
17aIhDQ1k8s10,,,  and to also let the audience see
17aIhDQ1k8s10,,,  what you 're really talking about which
17aIhDQ1k8s10,,,  is why
17aIhDQ1k8s10,,,  presentation are really helpful when it
17aIhDQ1k8s10,,,  come to storytelling
17aIhDQ1k8s11,2.15,2.24,  now that we know that we 're going to go
17aIhDQ1k8s11,,,  into
17aIhDQ1k8s11,,,  learning how we can do those but the
17aIhDQ1k8s11,,,  technical
17aIhDQ1k8s11,,,  presentation skill
17aIhDQ1k8s11,,,  first off there are animation which
17aIhDQ1k8s12,2.27,2.4,  help keep the audience focused
17aIhDQ1k8s12,,,  enhance their visual impact
17aIhDQ1k8s12,,,  just like that that is one one animation
17aIhDQ1k8s12,,,  just to keep the audience focused on
17aIhDQ1k8s12,,,  this next
17aIhDQ1k8s12,,,  on this next technical aspect that i am
17aIhDQ1k8s13,2.43,2.54,  showing you
17aIhDQ1k8s13,,,  transition which is a period of
17aIhDQ1k8s13,,,  changing from one slide to another
17aIhDQ1k8s13,,,  it 's really helpful to help to divide
17aIhDQ1k8s13,,,  your topic into smaller piece when you
17aIhDQ1k8s13,,,  incorporate transition
17aIhDQ1k8s14,2.58,3.1,  visuals help guide the audience on what
17aIhDQ1k8s14,,,  the speaker is talking about
17aIhDQ1k8s14,,,  they also keep the presentation
17aIhDQ1k8s14,,,  interesting because there 's
17aIhDQ1k8s14,,,  there are image to help the audience
17aIhDQ1k8s14,,,  see what the speaker is trying to
17aIhDQ1k8s15,3.13,3.25,  illustrate
17aIhDQ1k8s15,,,  in his or her presentation the note
17aIhDQ1k8s15,,,  help to guide the speaker during the
17aIhDQ1k8s15,,,  presentation
17aIhDQ1k8s15,,,  three platform that i highly recommend
17aIhDQ1k8s15,,,  is google slide
17aIhDQ1k8s16,3.26,3.38,  powerpoint and prezi glue slice is
17aIhDQ1k8s16,,,  helpful to use
17aIhDQ1k8s16,,,  when you 're using it online and you want
17aIhDQ1k8s16,,,  to collaborate with others
17aIhDQ1k8s16,,,  to work on a presentation together
17aIhDQ1k8s16,,,  microsoft powerpoint is good with
17aIhDQ1k8s17,3.4,3.54,  offline use when you do n't have wi
17aIhDQ1k8s17,,,  and it ha a lot of it ha a lot more
17aIhDQ1k8s17,,,  animation feature that you can use
17aIhDQ1k8s17,,,  and prezi is really good with really
17aIhDQ1k8s17,,,  long presentation
17aIhDQ1k8s17,,,  and just like what i 'm using right now
17aIhDQ1k8s18,3.56,4.11,  which is prezi it can get a little
17aIhDQ1k8s18,,,  complicated
17aIhDQ1k8s18,,,  and the only only setback is that
17aIhDQ1k8s18,,,  in the free version the version
17aIhDQ1k8s18,,,  the powerpoint that you save is open to
17aIhDQ1k8s18,,,  the public
17aIhDQ1k8s19,4.12,4.23,  so you do n't have private access
17aIhDQ1k8s19,,,  when you 're using presentation keep in
17aIhDQ1k8s19,,,  mind that you do n't have to use a lot of
17aIhDQ1k8s19,,,  text
17aIhDQ1k8s19,,,  just a long a you have visuals and
17aIhDQ1k8s19,,,  some thing
17aIhDQ1k8s21,4.24,4.4,  to help the audience to be gain the same
17aIhDQ1k8s21,,,  momentum
17aIhDQ1k8s21,,,  and be in the same pace with you
17aIhDQ1k8s21,,,  and follow along to your story
17aIhDQ1k8s21,,,  that 's all for today i hope this is
17aIhDQ1k8s21,,,  helpful and learning more about how we
17aIhDQ1k8s21,,,  can incorporate story
17aIhDQ1k8s21,,,  into our presentation
d5jhyhZ9pZ01,0.09,0.22,  hi everyone it 's so nice to see you
d5jhyhZ9pZ01,,,  again and thank you for sticking with u

d5jhyhZ9pZ01,,,  an amazing public speaker where 's my my
d5jhyhZ9pZ02,0.28,0.57,  visual aid but Oh tell me carry can
d5jhyhZ9pZ02,,,  see now oh we 're not going to be talking
d5jhyhZ9pZ02,,,  about that visual aid we 're going to be
d5jhyhZ9pZ02,,,  talking about visual aid that you can
d5jhyhZ9pZ02,,,  use in your presentation
d5jhyhZ9pZ02,,,  according to research with visual aid
d5jhyhZ9pZ03,1,1.17,  you can say something without even
d5jhyhZ9pZ03,,,  seeing you know so today in this video I
d5jhyhZ9pZ03,,,  am going to tell you about visual aid
d5jhyhZ9pZ03,,,  you can use in your speech firstly
d5jhyhZ9pZ03,,,  know what a visual aid is now visual
d5jhyhZ9pZ03,,,  aid are thing or object that you use
d5jhyhZ9pZ04,1.21,1.37,  in your presentation to even even your
d5jhyhZ9pZ04,,,  clothes or a visual age for example a
d5jhyhZ9pZ04,,,  man who is wearing a suit and tie is
d5jhyhZ9pZ04,,,  trying to tell the audience that he is
d5jhyhZ9pZ04,,,  mature and professional picture and
d5jhyhZ9pZ04,,,  video are also a visual aid even thing
d5jhyhZ9pZ05,1.4,1.55,  or object that you hold in your hand
d5jhyhZ9pZ05,,,  which are known a prop are also a
d5jhyhZ9pZ05,,,  visual aid and all of these help your
d5jhyhZ9pZ05,,,  audience understand your speech better
d5jhyhZ9pZ05,,,  second is know when and how to use a
d5jhyhZ9pZ05,,,  visual aim you should use visual aid
d5jhyhZ9pZ06,1.58,2.14,  when you want to make something very
d5jhyhZ9pZ06,,,  clear for example I can show you my
d5jhyhZ9pZ06,,,  favorite food or my favorite animal but
d5jhyhZ9pZ06,,,  do n't use too many image or too many
d5jhyhZ9pZ06,,,  prop or else just keep the focus away
d5jhyhZ9pZ06,,,  from your presentation here are some
d5jhyhZ9pZ07,2.18,2.32,  extra tip for you first wear clothes
d5jhyhZ9pZ07,,,  that are suitable for your presentation
d5jhyhZ9pZ07,,,  for example if you 're going to talk
d5jhyhZ9pZ07,,,  about something very serious wear a suit
d5jhyhZ9pZ07,,,  or something that look professional
d5jhyhZ9pZ07,,,  next if you do n't have a computer or
d5jhyhZ9pZ08,2.35,2.48,  projector you can use prop item that
d5jhyhZ9pZ08,,,  you can hold in your
d5jhyhZ9pZ08,,,  during the presentation but this usually
d5jhyhZ9pZ08,,,  work better when you 're going to talk
d5jhyhZ9pZ08,,,  explicitly about this prop like for
d5jhyhZ9pZ08,,,  example your favorite pen or your
d5jhyhZ9pZ09,2.51,3.09,  favorite book or even your favorite toy
d5jhyhZ9pZ09,,,  now let 's try an activity to practice
d5jhyhZ9pZ09,,,  using visual aid in our presentation
d5jhyhZ9pZ09,,,  first find a pen or a pencil then think
d5jhyhZ9pZ09,,,  of three thing that are useful or
d5jhyhZ9pZ09,,,  thing that you like about that pen or
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,3.12,4.2,  pencil after that present that to your
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  class using pen or pencil let me give
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  you an example this is a very useful pen
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  it 's blue in color and it us blue ink
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  I use this pen to write amazing speech
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  for my public speaking class
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  visual aid are tough to use but do n't
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  worry with enough practice you 'll be a
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  master of them in no time so that 's all
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  for today and I 'll see you guy in the
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,,,  next public speaking video bye
F977vuuxAGA1,0,0.11,  hello and congratulation on getting
F977vuuxAGA1,,,  access to this video course
F977vuuxAGA1,,,  on how to create engaging presentation
F977vuuxAGA1,,,  so this video course is all about prezi
F977vuuxAGA1,,,  which is
F977vuuxAGA1,,,  the software platform that enables you
F977vuuxAGA2,0.13,0.22,  to create
F977vuuxAGA2,,,  engaging presentation now why did we
F977vuuxAGA2,,,  choose this over powerpoint well
F977vuuxAGA2,,,  i 'll talk about that in just a minute a
F977vuuxAGA2,,,  you know
F977vuuxAGA2,,,  creating engaging video and
F977vuuxAGA3,0.24,0.34,  presentation
F977vuuxAGA3,,,  is very much important in this day and
F977vuuxAGA3,,,  age
F977vuuxAGA3,,,  especially when many different social
F977vuuxAGA3,,,  medium platform or
F977vuuxAGA3,,,  other platform look for high engagement
F977vuuxAGA4,0.38,0.49,  right in order to sell something you
F977vuuxAGA4,,,  need to have an engaging
F977vuuxAGA4,,,  presentation at least to gain people 's
F977vuuxAGA4,,,  trust
F977vuuxAGA4,,,  and get them to interact with you now
F977vuuxAGA4,,,  powerpoint ha come a long way a well
F977vuuxAGA5,0.52,1.04,  a
F977vuuxAGA5,,,  prezi but when you see prezi next which
F977vuuxAGA5,,,  is the latest version of
F977vuuxAGA5,,,  prezi you will be wowed
F977vuuxAGA5,,,  so with that said let me jump right into
F977vuuxAGA5,,,  this introduction so
F977vuuxAGA6,1.06,1.15,  what i want to do is give you a quick
F977vuuxAGA6,,,  overview of what 's inside
F977vuuxAGA6,,,  this video course this is the
F977vuuxAGA6,,,  introduction
F977vuuxAGA6,,,  video number two is prezi made easy
F977vuuxAGA6,,,  and i 'll talk about the difference
F977vuuxAGA7,1.17,1.3,  between prezi next and prezi
F977vuuxAGA7,,,  classic which is the older version of
F977vuuxAGA7,,,  prezi and how they are different
F977vuuxAGA7,,,  and then we 'll talk about how to start
F977vuuxAGA7,,,  your own prezi presentation in video
F977vuuxAGA7,,,  number three
F977vuuxAGA8,1.31,1.43,  video number four is the prezi site
F977vuuxAGA8,,,  overview
F977vuuxAGA8,,,  and we 'll talk about how to dive in
F977vuuxAGA8,,,  how to get started and all of that video
F977vuuxAGA8,,,  number five will talk about how to start
F977vuuxAGA8,,,  a
F977vuuxAGA9,1.44,1.55,  new prezi and we 'll show you a demo
F977vuuxAGA9,,,  and everything like that and video
F977vuuxAGA9,,,  number six we 'll talk about editing and
F977vuuxAGA9,,,  customization
F977vuuxAGA9,,,  how do you make it fit your need
F977vuuxAGA9,,,  essentially
F977vuuxAGA10,1.56,2.07,  and video number seven will talk about
F977vuuxAGA10,,,  shortcut key so
F977vuuxAGA10,,,  a you begin to learn prezi having
F977vuuxAGA10,,,  access to the shortcut key
F977vuuxAGA10,,,  definitely can help speed up the whole
F977vuuxAGA10,,,  process
F977vuuxAGA11,2.08,2.19,  video number eight we 'll talk about
F977vuuxAGA11,,,  adding voiceovers
F977vuuxAGA11,,,  and background sound so for those of you
F977vuuxAGA11,,,  who want to take
F977vuuxAGA11,,,  prezi and essentially turn it into a
F977vuuxAGA11,,,  video
F977vuuxAGA12,2.2,2.29,  this video will be for you so we 're
F977vuuxAGA12,,,  obviously going to be using a different
F977vuuxAGA12,,,  software to do that
F977vuuxAGA12,,,  but that said i 'm going to show you how
F977vuuxAGA12,,,  to do that and of course last but not
F977vuuxAGA12,,,  least
F977vuuxAGA13,2.29,2.43,  video number nine we 're going to show
F977vuuxAGA13,,,  you how to collaborate
F977vuuxAGA13,,,  via prezi so how do you collaborate via
F977vuuxAGA13,,,  your team either in the sense of
F977vuuxAGA13,,,  putting it all together or maybe
F977vuuxAGA13,,,  collaboration
F977vuuxAGA14,2.44,2.53,  in term of learning so we 'll show you
F977vuuxAGA14,,,  more in just a second so
F977vuuxAGA14,,,  first thing first why prezi versus
F977vuuxAGA14,,,  powerpoint
F977vuuxAGA14,,,  you know obviously i could made this
F977vuuxAGA14,,,  video course about powerpoint
F977vuuxAGA15,2.55,3.08,  and powerpoint ha come a long way and
F977vuuxAGA15,,,  they have evolved over the year but the
F977vuuxAGA15,,,  reason why we chose prezi over
F977vuuxAGA15,,,  powerpoint is simply because prezi
F977vuuxAGA15,,,  really allows you to
F977vuuxAGA15,,,  really engage with your viewer
F977vuuxAGA16,3.11,3.23,  and you 'll see in just a minute how
F977vuuxAGA16,,,  engaging it really is
F977vuuxAGA16,,,  now you 'll notice in just a minute with
F977vuuxAGA16,,,  prezi next they kind of have moved
F977vuuxAGA16,,,  more towards the powerful function of
F977vuuxAGA16,,,  powerpoint
F977vuuxAGA17,3.24,3.35,  so essentially what they 've done is
F977vuuxAGA17,,,  they 've taken the most powerful feature
F977vuuxAGA17,,,  of powerpoint
F977vuuxAGA17,,,  and taken the most powerful feature of
F977vuuxAGA17,,,  prezi and combined them together
F977vuuxAGA17,,,  to make an amazing tool
F977vuuxAGA18,3.38,3.5,  alright so with that said let 's jump
F977vuuxAGA18,,,  into
F977vuuxAGA18,,,  video number two
F977vuuxAGA18,,,  hello and welcome back this is video
F977vuuxAGA18,,,  number two
F977vuuxAGA18,,,  and we 're going to dive right in and i 'm
F977vuuxAGA19,3.52,4.02,  going to talk about prezi
F977vuuxAGA19,,,  next which is the latest version of
F977vuuxAGA19,,,  prezi
F977vuuxAGA19,,,  versus prezi classic so
F977vuuxAGA19,,,  a of now of making this video course
F977vuuxAGA19,,,  you can either
F977vuuxAGA20,4.04,4.14,  make your prezi classic video or prezi
F977vuuxAGA20,,,  next
F977vuuxAGA20,,,  now keep in mind that if you make any
F977vuuxAGA20,,,  prezi presentation
F977vuuxAGA20,,,  in prezi classic you can not really
F977vuuxAGA20,,,  import them into prezi next and you 'll
F977vuuxAGA21,4.18,4.29,  get an
F977vuuxAGA21,,,  idea of what the major difference are
F977vuuxAGA21,,,  that way you can
F977vuuxAGA21,,,  decide on which one to go now prezi next
F977vuuxAGA21,,,  new feature so prezi next is like i said
F977vuuxAGA21,,,  the latest version
F977vuuxAGA22,4.31,4.45,  of prezi and the main difference
F977vuuxAGA22,,,  one of the main difference is that
F977vuuxAGA22,,,  prezi next
F977vuuxAGA22,,,  run on html5 so a you will notice
F977vuuxAGA22,,,  a good amount of presentation
F977vuuxAGA22,,,  video player they 're all moving towards
F977vuuxAGA23,4.48,5.01,  html5
F977vuuxAGA23,,,  that 's essentially the future while on
F977vuuxAGA23,,,  the other hand
F977vuuxAGA23,,,  classic prezi run on adobe flash so
F977vuuxAGA23,,,  a you know certain browser a of now
F977vuuxAGA23,,,  they have
F977vuuxAGA24,5.01,5.15,  literally gotten rid of playing
F977vuuxAGA24,,,  adobe flash because many people
F977vuuxAGA24,,,  consider it to be unsafe and prone to
F977vuuxAGA24,,,  performance issue so that 's the big big
F977vuuxAGA24,,,  thing
F977vuuxAGA24,,,  and other than that frame for example
F977vuuxAGA25,5.18,5.28,  which will make more sense when i dive
F977vuuxAGA25,,,  in
F977vuuxAGA25,,,  are hidden until you 're ready to show
F977vuuxAGA25,,,  them you can use
F977vuuxAGA25,,,  fade in or fade out animation which
F977vuuxAGA25,,,  allow you to
F977vuuxAGA26,5.28,5.4,  manually hide content until you 're
F977vuuxAGA26,,,  actually ready to show them
F977vuuxAGA26,,,  so the nice thing about prezi is a lot
F977vuuxAGA26,,,  of item
F977vuuxAGA26,,,  you can not see until you zoom in so kind
F977vuuxAGA26,,,  of how you saw
F977vuuxAGA27,5.42,5.51,  how i zoomed in so you saw the nine
F977vuuxAGA27,,,  different
F977vuuxAGA27,,,  video topic and then i wa able to zoom
F977vuuxAGA27,,,  in
F977vuuxAGA27,,,  so that 's the nice thing about prezi
F977vuuxAGA27,,,  compared to powerpoint is with
F977vuuxAGA28,5.52,6.01,  powerpoint
F977vuuxAGA28,,,  you ca n't really do that but with prezi
F977vuuxAGA28,,,  you can and you can do so much more
F977vuuxAGA28,,,  which i 'll show you in just a minute and
F977vuuxAGA28,,,  also with prezi next you can click
F977vuuxAGA28,,,  and zoom on any frame during the
F977vuuxAGA29,6.04,6.15,  presentation
F977vuuxAGA29,,,  and you are not stuck on just like
F977vuuxAGA29,,,  following the slide path sequence
F977vuuxAGA29,,,  number so
F977vuuxAGA29,,,  with the previous classic prezi you can
F977vuuxAGA29,,,  only go in order you have to go like
F977vuuxAGA30,6.17,6.25,  in order of creating it but with prezi
F977vuuxAGA30,,,  next which i 'll show you in just a
F977vuuxAGA30,,,  minute
F977vuuxAGA30,,,  for example with the nine video i could
F977vuuxAGA30,,,  either go in order
F977vuuxAGA30,,,  or i could just pick and choose the
F977vuuxAGA31,6.28,6.37,  bubble right
F977vuuxAGA31,,,  so that 's the main difference is you 're
F977vuuxAGA31,,,  not stuck
F977vuuxAGA31,,,  on having to follow step one step two
F977vuuxAGA31,,,  step three step four
F977vuuxAGA31,,,  and what that allows you to do is it
F977vuuxAGA32,6.39,6.48,  allows you to create a more engaging
F977vuuxAGA32,,,  presentation so that way let 's say for
F977vuuxAGA32,,,  example you 're doing a webinar
F977vuuxAGA32,,,  or you 're doing a presentation or sale
F977vuuxAGA32,,,  presentation
F977vuuxAGA32,,,  you can pick and choose which circle
F977vuuxAGA33,6.5,7,  that you want to go into
F977vuuxAGA33,,,  and you can skip some you do n't even
F977vuuxAGA33,,,  have to go in order so that 's what make
F977vuuxAGA33,,,  it more interactive
F977vuuxAGA33,,,  doe that make sense so it provides
F977vuuxAGA33,,,  analytics also by showing how many
F977vuuxAGA34,7.03,7.17,  people viewed your presentation
F977vuuxAGA34,,,  who they shared it with and which part
F977vuuxAGA34,,,  interest them most that 's amazing
F977vuuxAGA34,,,  because you were not able to do that
F977vuuxAGA34,,,  in the original classic prezi plus a
F977vuuxAGA34,,,  you will see in a minute there 's is a
F977vuuxAGA35,7.19,7.32,  cleaner slicker look
F977vuuxAGA35,,,  with subtopics and page a far a
F977vuuxAGA35,,,  setting thing up
F977vuuxAGA35,,,  the structure is just a lot more
F977vuuxAGA35,,,  cleaner everything is structured
F977vuuxAGA35,,,  properly
F977vuuxAGA36,7.34,7.44,  and it 's just a lot easier a far a
F977vuuxAGA36,,,  usability go
F977vuuxAGA36,,,  i remember back in the day with classic
F977vuuxAGA36,,,  prezi you know setting thing up wa
F977vuuxAGA36,,,  actually very complicated
F977vuuxAGA36,,,  once you set thing up it looked really
F977vuuxAGA37,7.46,7.55,  nice but to get to that point
F977vuuxAGA37,,,  you literally would have to sit there
F977vuuxAGA37,,,  for hour setting up a prezi
F977vuuxAGA37,,,  so nowadays setting up a prezi with
F977vuuxAGA37,,,  pricing next
F977vuuxAGA37,,,  is just so much easier with that said
F977vuuxAGA38,7.59,8.11,  let 's move on to
F977vuuxAGA38,,,  video number three
F977vuuxAGA38,,,  okay so welcome back this is video
F977vuuxAGA38,,,  number three
F977vuuxAGA38,,,  and we 're going to talk about how to
F977vuuxAGA38,,,  start your prizzy
F977vuuxAGA39,8.13,8.27,  presentation and i 'm really going to
F977vuuxAGA39,,,  talk specifically about
F977vuuxAGA39,,,  prezi next structure how thing are
F977vuuxAGA39,,,  structured in this prezi next
F977vuuxAGA39,,,  new type of update and that way you
F977vuuxAGA39,,,  have a better idea of how thing are
F977vuuxAGA40,8.29,8.36,  broken down
F977vuuxAGA40,,,  so i do n't want to jump in straight
F977vuuxAGA40,,,  ahead right now i want to talk about the
F977vuuxAGA40,,,  structure
F977vuuxAGA40,,,  and that way you can dive straight in in
F977vuuxAGA40,,,  the next video after this all right so
F977vuuxAGA41,8.38,8.5,  let 's jump in and just take a look at a
F977vuuxAGA41,,,  structure
F977vuuxAGA41,,,  okay so let 's jump right in so the first
F977vuuxAGA41,,,  thing you 're going to see
F977vuuxAGA41,,,  is in this example i just chose a random
F977vuuxAGA41,,,  template
F977vuuxAGA42,8.51,9.01,  but typically with prezi next you 're
F977vuuxAGA42,,,  going to see these little
F977vuuxAGA42,,,  bubble all right so these little
F977vuuxAGA42,,,  bubble are basically topic
F977vuuxAGA42,,,  so the nice thing about prezi next is i
F977vuuxAGA42,,,  could switch between this one
F977vuuxAGA43,9.02,9.13,  this one and this one i do n't have to go
F977vuuxAGA43,,,  in any order
F977vuuxAGA43,,,  which is nice but these are basically
F977vuuxAGA43,,,  topic all right so
F977vuuxAGA43,,,  when you click on one of these click
F977vuuxAGA43,,,  this one here
F977vuuxAGA44,9.14,9.26,  you 'll see these here and what these are
F977vuuxAGA44,,,  are
F977vuuxAGA44,,,  are subtopics so this is the subtopic so
F977vuuxAGA44,,,  we went from
F977vuuxAGA44,,,  topic a a very general to sub topic
F977vuuxAGA44,,,  so this right here is a subtopic so you
F977vuuxAGA45,9.29,9.4,  can add
F977vuuxAGA45,,,  more element to the subtopic so if you
F977vuuxAGA45,,,  click subtopic
F977vuuxAGA45,,,  and there 's two topic type there 's
F977vuuxAGA45,,,  planet in stack
F977vuuxAGA45,,,  planet basically allows you to add more
F977vuuxAGA46,9.42,9.52,  circle
F977vuuxAGA46,,,  so we 'll do that now you can see that
F977vuuxAGA46,,,  this wa the fourth circle
F977vuuxAGA46,,,  so we had one two and three and four and
F977vuuxAGA46,,,  of course you can always stretch it out
F977vuuxAGA46,,,  if you would like
F977vuuxAGA47,9.56,10.06,  but it always look professional no
F977vuuxAGA47,,,  matter what
F977vuuxAGA47,,,  so the thing with a classic prezi wa
F977vuuxAGA47,,,  you can go all
F977vuuxAGA47,,,  out and if you know you were n't really
F977vuuxAGA47,,,  very creative it would be hard to make
F977vuuxAGA48,10.09,10.19,  it really look nice
F977vuuxAGA48,,,  and structured so now you do n't have to
F977vuuxAGA48,,,  worry about that everything is now
F977vuuxAGA48,,,  very much structured now if i clicked on
F977vuuxAGA48,,,  that little circle that i clicked on
F977vuuxAGA48,,,  just now
F977vuuxAGA49,10.22,10.41,  and i clicked on subtopic here
F977vuuxAGA49,,,  and let 's add something here
F977vuuxAGA49,,,  so you can a you can see you can add
F977vuuxAGA49,,,  in more subtopics more subtopics and
F977vuuxAGA49,,,  more
F977vuuxAGA49,,,  now we could add slack topic type
F977vuuxAGA50,10.45,10.58,  like this and with slack topic type
F977vuuxAGA50,,,  a you can see now it look like a
F977vuuxAGA50,,,  powerpoint presentation
F977vuuxAGA50,,,  but now you can add page underneath
F977vuuxAGA50,,,  so think about page kind of like a
F977vuuxAGA50,,,  powerpoint slide
F977vuuxAGA51,11,11.1,  so they 're all they are is really just
F977vuuxAGA51,,,  different element
F977vuuxAGA51,,,  different way to kind of showcase
F977vuuxAGA51,,,  what you 're trying to teach what you 're
F977vuuxAGA51,,,  trying to present
F977vuuxAGA51,,,  so just to recap we 've got topic at the
F977vuuxAGA52,11.13,11.23,  top
F977vuuxAGA52,,,  sub topic below that and you can do a
F977vuuxAGA52,,,  many sub topic
F977vuuxAGA52,,,  and then you can also do page a well
F977vuuxAGA52,,,  so a long a you understand kind of how
F977vuuxAGA52,,,  that is structured
F977vuuxAGA53,11.26,11.37,  then getting creative and making your
F977vuuxAGA53,,,  presentation look really nice
F977vuuxAGA53,,,  is actually a breeze so i just wanted to
F977vuuxAGA53,,,  cover that
F977vuuxAGA53,,,  initially before we actually jumped
F977vuuxAGA53,,,  right in so
F977vuuxAGA54,11.38,11.53,  now you understand how thing are set up
F977vuuxAGA54,,,  hello and welcome back this is video
F977vuuxAGA54,,,  number four and let 's talk about the
F977vuuxAGA54,,,  prezi site overview and i want to give
F977vuuxAGA54,,,  you
F977vuuxAGA54,,,  a better overview of before we jump in
F977vuuxAGA55,11.56,12.08,  the template how to choose them we 'll
F977vuuxAGA55,,,  talk about prezi next
F977vuuxAGA55,,,  the app and how basically everything
F977vuuxAGA55,,,  work
F977vuuxAGA55,,,  before we begin to edit and customize a
F977vuuxAGA55,,,  prezi okay so in this particular video
F977vuuxAGA56,12.11,12.25,  i 'm not really going to show you how to
F977vuuxAGA56,,,  build a prezi from scratch but i want to
F977vuuxAGA56,,,  give you kind of an overarching
F977vuuxAGA56,,,  overview of the prezi dashboard
F977vuuxAGA56,,,  the app and all that 's available to you
F977vuuxAGA56,,,  so that you know
F977vuuxAGA57,12.26,12.37,  what the difference are between each
F977vuuxAGA57,,,  and that way you can make a better
F977vuuxAGA57,,,  decision
F977vuuxAGA57,,,  on what route you want to go
F977vuuxAGA57,,,  now if you are just getting started i 'm
F977vuuxAGA57,,,  not really aware
F977vuuxAGA58,12.38,12.48,  of whether you 're able to see prezi
F977vuuxAGA58,,,  classic or not
F977vuuxAGA58,,,  that may be something that is just
F977vuuxAGA58,,,  available to older
F977vuuxAGA58,,,  customer but if you do see prezi
F977vuuxAGA58,,,  classic
F977vuuxAGA59,12.49,12.59,  i highly recommend that you just stick
F977vuuxAGA59,,,  with prezi next
F977vuuxAGA59,,,  and the reason being is because prezi
F977vuuxAGA59,,,  next is just so much
F977vuuxAGA59,,,  easier it 's structured everything look
F977vuuxAGA59,,,  nice
F977vuuxAGA60,13,13.12,  and it just give you more flexibility
F977vuuxAGA60,,,  without
F977vuuxAGA60,,,  all the tedious work prezi classic we
F977vuuxAGA60,,,  just happened to be very
F977vuuxAGA60,,,  well versed with it so we know a little
F977vuuxAGA60,,,  bit more about it but
F977vuuxAGA61,13.13,13.25,  after we tested at prezi next recently
F977vuuxAGA61,,,  which is why if we go to prezi classic
F977vuuxAGA61,,,  you 'll see that we have about 21
F977vuuxAGA61,,,  presentation so we 've really been using
F977vuuxAGA61,,,  prezi
F977vuuxAGA61,,,  classic but prezi next on the other hand
F977vuuxAGA62,13.29,13.37,  we 've only tested a few but from what
F977vuuxAGA62,,,  we 've tested we
F977vuuxAGA62,,,  found that a lot of the prezis you 'll
F977vuuxAGA62,,,  notice
F977vuuxAGA62,,,  they have the circle of course you can
F977vuuxAGA62,,,  change the circle
F977vuuxAGA63,13.38,13.48,  to something else but they look very
F977vuuxAGA63,,,  similar
F977vuuxAGA63,,,  they the layout is very similar they
F977vuuxAGA63,,,  look sleeker
F977vuuxAGA63,,,  more beautiful more engaging and all of
F977vuuxAGA63,,,  that so
F977vuuxAGA64,13.49,14,  just want to say if you are getting
F977vuuxAGA64,,,  started just start out with prezi next
F977vuuxAGA64,,,  do n't go with anything else
F977vuuxAGA64,,,  so the nice thing about president next
F977vuuxAGA64,,,  also is you are able to see
F977vuuxAGA64,,,  the analytics you can actually see the
F977vuuxAGA65,14.03,14.14,  stats and that 's something that you wa
F977vuuxAGA65,,,  you were never really able to do with
F977vuuxAGA65,,,  the older version now there is a prezi
F977vuuxAGA65,,,  next app
F977vuuxAGA65,,,  so a you can see here i 'm using
F977vuuxAGA65,,,  a window computer and i have the prezi
F977vuuxAGA66,14.18,14.28,  window app here the main difference is
F977vuuxAGA66,,,  just
F977vuuxAGA66,,,  you know i 'm editing it on my window
F977vuuxAGA66,,,  computer versus editing
F977vuuxAGA66,,,  with the browser now
F977vuuxAGA66,,,  you will also notice that they also have
F977vuuxAGA67,14.31,14.43,  mobile apps too so it really depends on
F977vuuxAGA67,,,  your preference sometimes
F977vuuxAGA67,,,  some people depend being who they are
F977vuuxAGA67,,,  may want to edit on window may want to
F977vuuxAGA67,,,  edit on the browser
F977vuuxAGA67,,,  or even may want to edit on the mobile
F977vuuxAGA68,14.46,14.56,  app so
F977vuuxAGA68,,,  really what it come down to is it 's not
F977vuuxAGA68,,,  that something is better than the other
F977vuuxAGA68,,,  it 's just a matter of preference
F977vuuxAGA68,,,  which route do you want to take all
F977vuuxAGA68,,,  right
F977vuuxAGA69,14.59,15.09,  okay so welcome back this is video
F977vuuxAGA69,,,  number five
F977vuuxAGA69,,,  and we 're gon na dive straight in and
F977vuuxAGA69,,,  talk about how to start
F977vuuxAGA69,,,  a new prezi basically
F977vuuxAGA69,,,  building a prezi from scratch you can
F977vuuxAGA70,15.12,15.24,  either build it from complete scratch
F977vuuxAGA70,,,  or you can actually just use a template
F977vuuxAGA70,,,  which is actually a simpler route i
F977vuuxAGA70,,,  highly recommend that route
F977vuuxAGA70,,,  and for those of you who are super
F977vuuxAGA70,,,  creative and
F977vuuxAGA71,15.25,15.36,  i highly recommend if you really really
F977vuuxAGA71,,,  have
F977vuuxAGA71,,,  started out using template and you 've
F977vuuxAGA71,,,  gotten
F977vuuxAGA71,,,  really well versed with the template
F977vuuxAGA71,,,  then and only then do i actually
F977vuuxAGA72,15.37,15.48,  recommend that you actually start from
F977vuuxAGA72,,,  a clean slate but if you 've never used
F977vuuxAGA72,,,  prezi next before
F977vuuxAGA72,,,  i highly recommend that you start with
F977vuuxAGA72,,,  the template first
F977vuuxAGA72,,,  get used to the actual animation the
F977vuuxAGA73,15.51,16.01,  option and all of that
F977vuuxAGA73,,,  first before you move to a little bit
F977vuuxAGA73,,,  more advanced all right so
F977vuuxAGA73,,,  let 's start with some of the basic and
F977vuuxAGA73,,,  move from there right so
F977vuuxAGA73,,,  let 's go ahead and click new
F977vuuxAGA74,16.03,16.16,  presentation
F977vuuxAGA74,,,  and let me go ahead and walk you around
F977vuuxAGA74,,,  now you will notice that it doe take a
F977vuuxAGA74,,,  little bit of time to load
F977vuuxAGA74,,,  so depending on your internet connection
F977vuuxAGA74,,,  and there you go so
F977vuuxAGA75,16.17,16.29,  a you can see here we got many
F977vuuxAGA75,,,  different category we got sale and
F977vuuxAGA75,,,  development we have marketing
F977vuuxAGA75,,,  education hr and training in general
F977vuuxAGA75,,,  and you 've got a huge amount of
F977vuuxAGA75,,,  template
F977vuuxAGA76,16.3,16.41,  really good looking template and in my
F977vuuxAGA76,,,  mind
F977vuuxAGA76,,,  compared to the prezi classic
F977vuuxAGA76,,,  this is just way better of course prezi
F977vuuxAGA76,,,  compared to powerpoint the original
F977vuuxAGA76,,,  classic version
F977vuuxAGA77,16.42,16.57,  i thought wa better than powerpoint
F977vuuxAGA77,,,  regardless so these are just the
F977vuuxAGA77,,,  a certain amount of template you have
F977vuuxAGA77,,,  access to and a you can see you have
F977vuuxAGA77,,,  a huge huge amount of template
F977vuuxAGA77,,,  all right so let 's just go ahead and
F977vuuxAGA78,16.58,17.14,  pick one of these and let 's just
F977vuuxAGA78,,,  go ahead and run with it so let 's go
F977vuuxAGA78,,,  ahead and
F977vuuxAGA78,,,  let 's just choose this one here alright
F977vuuxAGA78,,,  so click on it
F977vuuxAGA78,,,  it 's loading the template preview so we
F977vuuxAGA79,17.17,17.29,  have a better idea of what it look like
F977vuuxAGA79,,,  so the nice thing about prezi is you
F977vuuxAGA79,,,  know you can change the background you
F977vuuxAGA79,,,  could change it to
F977vuuxAGA79,,,  an image of your company of your
F977vuuxAGA79,,,  building
F977vuuxAGA80,17.3,17.41,  or you can change it to something else
F977vuuxAGA80,,,  it really is up to you so that 's where
F977vuuxAGA80,,,  the customization process
F977vuuxAGA80,,,  come in so the nice thing about this is
F977vuuxAGA80,,,  you can take a look at it and see
F977vuuxAGA80,,,  you know is this really right for me do
F977vuuxAGA81,17.43,17.54,  i really want
F977vuuxAGA81,,,  to use this and let 's
F977vuuxAGA81,,,  just go ahead and click use this
F977vuuxAGA81,,,  template
F977vuuxAGA81,,,  okay so that took a little bit more time
F977vuuxAGA81,,,  but i went ahead and paused that so that
F977vuuxAGA82,17.56,18.09,  we can zoom forward
F977vuuxAGA82,,,  but up at the top you can of course
F977vuuxAGA82,,,  change the title of
F977vuuxAGA82,,,  your prezi
F977vuuxAGA82,,,  so we could call this sale pitch one
F977vuuxAGA82,,,  you 've got file you can do new prezi you
F977vuuxAGA83,18.12,18.24,  can save you can show info
F977vuuxAGA83,,,  about the prezi
F977vuuxAGA83,,,  you can show your prezi so obviously
F977vuuxAGA83,,,  this would go out
F977vuuxAGA83,,,  and go to your other prezis which is not
F977vuuxAGA83,,,  what we really want to do
F977vuuxAGA84,18.26,18.36,  you can insert topic you can insert
F977vuuxAGA84,,,  text
F977vuuxAGA84,,,  chart image video even
F977vuuxAGA84,,,  to make it even more engaging shape
F977vuuxAGA84,,,  arrow
F977vuuxAGA84,,,  line icon and symbol
F977vuuxAGA85,18.39,18.51,  comment and animation so there are a
F977vuuxAGA85,,,  lot of
F977vuuxAGA85,,,  variety of different element that you
F977vuuxAGA85,,,  can insert
F977vuuxAGA85,,,  you can hide the background
F977vuuxAGA85,,,  you could hide comment or show
F977vuuxAGA86,18.53,19.02,  animation
F977vuuxAGA86,,,  you can go into presentation mode viewer
F977vuuxAGA86,,,  presentation viewer you can preview it
F977vuuxAGA86,,,  or
F977vuuxAGA86,,,  see what it look like live so you 're
F977vuuxAGA86,,,  really not going to need these until
F977vuuxAGA87,19.04,19.13,  you 're actually
F977vuuxAGA87,,,  done with everything else now like i
F977vuuxAGA87,,,  said earlier we have
F977vuuxAGA87,,,  topic and then of course when you drill
F977vuuxAGA87,,,  down
F977vuuxAGA87,,,  further you will be able to see
F977vuuxAGA88,19.15,19.27,  subtopics
F977vuuxAGA88,,,  like so and then you 're able to drill
F977vuuxAGA88,,,  further
F977vuuxAGA88,,,  which then will allow you to see page
F977vuuxAGA88,,,  so before like i showed you there were
F977vuuxAGA88,,,  page and then
F977vuuxAGA89,19.28,19.42,  subtopics and of course you can zoom
F977vuuxAGA89,,,  back
F977vuuxAGA89,,,  out and you 'll see animation
F977vuuxAGA89,,,  now remember how i said previously that
F977vuuxAGA89,,,  what the prezi next doe is it take the
F977vuuxAGA89,,,  most powerful
F977vuuxAGA90,19.44,19.56,  feature or the strength of the
F977vuuxAGA90,,,  classic prezi and microsoft
F977vuuxAGA90,,,  powerpoint and it brings it all together
F977vuuxAGA90,,,  and that 's what we have here so with
F977vuuxAGA90,,,  animation i could actually animate it
F977vuuxAGA90,,,  so that
F977vuuxAGA91,19.58,20.07,  i do n't want certain element to
F977vuuxAGA91,,,  actually appear until i actually begin
F977vuuxAGA91,,,  to click
F977vuuxAGA91,,,  and that 's the beauty of animation just
F977vuuxAGA91,,,  like a
F977vuuxAGA91,,,  powerpoint concept
F977vuuxAGA92,20.12,20.22,  hello and welcome back this is video
F977vuuxAGA92,,,  number six
F977vuuxAGA92,,,  and we 're gon na dive straight in and
F977vuuxAGA92,,,  continue where we left off
F977vuuxAGA92,,,  in the previous video where i showed you
F977vuuxAGA92,,,  kind of an overview of
F977vuuxAGA93,20.24,20.35,  how to start out your prezi next
F977vuuxAGA93,,,  presentation and now we 're going to dive
F977vuuxAGA93,,,  in and talk about editing and
F977vuuxAGA93,,,  customization
F977vuuxAGA93,,,  and we 'll talk about customizing your
F977vuuxAGA93,,,  prezi your image your color and your
F977vuuxAGA94,20.37,20.46,  animation
F977vuuxAGA94,,,  and everything else okay so now that you
F977vuuxAGA94,,,  understand how thing are structured
F977vuuxAGA94,,,  when it come to editing
F977vuuxAGA94,,,  customization grabbing you know
F977vuuxAGA94,,,  inserting image
F977vuuxAGA95,20.48,20.59,  grabbing image out inserting your own
F977vuuxAGA95,,,  image all that
F977vuuxAGA95,,,  it 's actually very easy process once
F977vuuxAGA95,,,  you 're utilizing a template
F977vuuxAGA95,,,  but like i said once you master the
F977vuuxAGA95,,,  template process you can actually move
F977vuuxAGA96,21,21.13,  straight into
F977vuuxAGA96,,,  beginning to start with a clean slate
F977vuuxAGA96,,,  and do your own thing kind of thing
F977vuuxAGA96,,,  so let 's just go ahead and go ahead and
F977vuuxAGA96,,,  customize from the top
F977vuuxAGA96,,,  down to the bottom so now we 're taking a
F977vuuxAGA97,21.14,21.24,  look at the overview which is the
F977vuuxAGA97,,,  overarching
F977vuuxAGA97,,,  view of everything and
F977vuuxAGA97,,,  before i actually even move into
F977vuuxAGA97,,,  anything let 's start kind of like a
F977vuuxAGA97,,,  cumulative order
F977vuuxAGA98,21.26,21.38,  so that it 's a better understandable
F977vuuxAGA98,,,  let 's say for example that we do n't want
F977vuuxAGA98,,,  certain element right here
F977vuuxAGA98,,,  to appear until we move forward
F977vuuxAGA98,,,  so we can actually let 's click on the
F977vuuxAGA98,,,  sale pitch for example
F977vuuxAGA99,21.4,21.55,  and maybe the background
F977vuuxAGA99,,,  so we 'll select that and then of course
F977vuuxAGA99,,,  you can
F977vuuxAGA99,,,  move that back over here and we 'll click
F977vuuxAGA99,,,  animation and then i 'm going to click
F977vuuxAGA99,,,  plus
F977vuuxAGA100,21.56,22.08,  so obviously you want to select the
F977vuuxAGA100,,,  element that you want to animate
F977vuuxAGA100,,,  click plus and then choose what you want
F977vuuxAGA100,,,  so we could do
F977vuuxAGA100,,,  fade in fade out so fade in
F977vuuxAGA100,,,  would usually naturally be okay when you
F977vuuxAGA101,22.1,22.26,  actually come in
F977vuuxAGA101,,,  and maybe later on it 'll be fade out
F977vuuxAGA101,,,  we could also fade in here
F977vuuxAGA101,,,  we could also initially zoom in
F977vuuxAGA101,,,  a well so you can zoom in you can add a
F977vuuxAGA101,,,  zoom in area
F977vuuxAGA102,22.28,22.41,  and all that so animation is just a
F977vuuxAGA102,,,  really
F977vuuxAGA102,,,  cool way to make thing appear
F977vuuxAGA102,,,  or when they 're not appeared appear
F977vuuxAGA102,,,  a you begin the presentation so
F977vuuxAGA102,,,  maybe you could start out with a kind of
F977vuuxAGA103,22.44,22.53,  just a view
F977vuuxAGA103,,,  of the circle the element
F977vuuxAGA103,,,  the the major topic and then of course
F977vuuxAGA103,,,  the
F977vuuxAGA103,,,  the background and then you begin the
F977vuuxAGA103,,,  presentation and it 's like wow that
F977vuuxAGA104,22.55,23.06,  look really cool kind of thing
F977vuuxAGA104,,,  so think about it from your your viewer
F977vuuxAGA104,,,  standpoint
F977vuuxAGA104,,,  what would make them think wow that 's
F977vuuxAGA104,,,  really interesting or
F977vuuxAGA104,,,  wow i did n't expect that to even happen
F977vuuxAGA105,23.08,23.19,  kind of thing
F977vuuxAGA105,,,  so that 's that and that 's basically how
F977vuuxAGA105,,,  animation work
F977vuuxAGA105,,,  you can also specify when the animation
F977vuuxAGA105,,,  happen so you can have it
F977vuuxAGA105,,,  at the beginning of the presentation
F977vuuxAGA106,23.22,23.34,  after the about which is these
F977vuuxAGA106,,,  topic here so every one of these
F977vuuxAGA106,,,  circle are topic remember so
F977vuuxAGA106,,,  you can have the animation appear after
F977vuuxAGA106,,,  every single one of these
F977vuuxAGA106,,,  topic here so you can actually specify
F977vuuxAGA107,23.37,23.46,  it
F977vuuxAGA107,,,  in more detail but i just wanted to show
F977vuuxAGA107,,,  you some brief
F977vuuxAGA107,,,  kind of overview of the animation
F977vuuxAGA107,,,  element themselves
F977vuuxAGA107,,,  so now i 'm going to select the about
F977vuuxAGA108,23.49,24.01,  topic and to customize it
F977vuuxAGA108,,,  very very easy to do so
F977vuuxAGA108,,,  this obviously would be good for a sale
F977vuuxAGA108,,,  pitch or an about
F977vuuxAGA108,,,  presentation and all you have to do to
F977vuuxAGA108,,,  customize it is select it
F977vuuxAGA109,24.03,24.17,  double click it and highlight it and
F977vuuxAGA109,,,  then of course
F977vuuxAGA109,,,  your office or your name or whatever
F977vuuxAGA109,,,  so office location you can
F977vuuxAGA109,,,  add the text here or if you want to
F977vuuxAGA109,,,  insert
F977vuuxAGA110,24.18,24.28,  a another element you can do that a
F977vuuxAGA110,,,  well so you can insert
F977vuuxAGA110,,,  up here subtopic text chart image
F977vuuxAGA110,,,  video
F977vuuxAGA110,,,  shape arrow line icon and symbol
F977vuuxAGA110,,,  so i could also insert an icon you can
F977vuuxAGA111,24.32,24.42,  have
F977vuuxAGA111,,,  light icon and dark icon
F977vuuxAGA111,,,  so if i select light icon you can see
F977vuuxAGA111,,,  they have
F977vuuxAGA111,,,  a light background on the back so we can
F977vuuxAGA111,,,  select
F977vuuxAGA112,24.43,24.55,  one of these and we can simply drag and
F977vuuxAGA112,,,  drop it over here
F977vuuxAGA112,,,  like so or if we go back here and we do
F977vuuxAGA112,,,  dar prezzies it 's just a dark background
F977vuuxAGA112,,,  here
F977vuuxAGA112,,,  so that 's really the main difference
F977vuuxAGA113,24.57,25.09,  between light prezis and
F977vuuxAGA113,,,  dark prezi icon so you can also insert
F977vuuxAGA113,,,  other element a
F977vuuxAGA113,,,  well if you would like to you can also
F977vuuxAGA113,,,  edit out the image so if you click on
F977vuuxAGA113,,,  the image here
F977vuuxAGA114,25.1,25.26,  we can click replace image
F977vuuxAGA114,,,  so we could go and look for an image
F977vuuxAGA114,,,  and we could select an image like this
F977vuuxAGA114,,,  and it 'll just upload it really fast a
F977vuuxAGA114,,,  you can see here
F977vuuxAGA114,,,  within a few second or le than 0.1
F977vuuxAGA115,25.28,25.41,  second actually
F977vuuxAGA115,,,  so we could do that and we could go back
F977vuuxAGA115,,,  just to kind of see what it look like
F977vuuxAGA115,,,  so we can zoom in like that
F977vuuxAGA115,,,  and go like that and so you can see how
F977vuuxAGA115,,,  easy it is you select the image you
F977vuuxAGA116,25.43,25.54,  click replace image
F977vuuxAGA116,,,  find the image that you want like that
F977vuuxAGA116,,,  and replace it
F977vuuxAGA116,,,  so what you see is kind of what you get
F977vuuxAGA116,,,  what you see and then you can replace
F977vuuxAGA116,,,  of course the color so you could select
F977vuuxAGA117,25.57,26.08,  this purple item and then select a
F977vuuxAGA117,,,  different color
F977vuuxAGA117,,,  like that so you know if you 've used
F977vuuxAGA117,,,  powerpoint you use microsoft word
F977vuuxAGA117,,,  the dashboard up here is fairly easy to
F977vuuxAGA117,,,  use
F977vuuxAGA118,26.1,26.19,  but you 'll notice that it change
F977vuuxAGA118,,,  depending on the element
F977vuuxAGA118,,,  that you choose so if you choose an
F977vuuxAGA118,,,  image it 'll tell you
F977vuuxAGA118,,,  replace an image if you choose you know
F977vuuxAGA118,,,  a color block it 'll tell you there 's
F977vuuxAGA119,26.21,26.31,  different option for the color block
F977vuuxAGA119,,,  if you choose text on the other hand you
F977vuuxAGA119,,,  have the opportunity to
F977vuuxAGA119,,,  you know change the size increase it
F977vuuxAGA119,,,  change the font
F977vuuxAGA119,,,  type you can bold italicize background
F977vuuxAGA120,26.34,26.43,  color
F977vuuxAGA120,,,  the color alignment so really basic
F977vuuxAGA120,,,  stuff when it come to
F977vuuxAGA120,,,  text stuff that you would see in a
F977vuuxAGA120,,,  pretty much most word processing system
F977vuuxAGA120,,,  now let 's say you want to add something
F977vuuxAGA121,26.45,26.58,  and you you know you do n't like
F977vuuxAGA121,,,  where this image is so you can actually
F977vuuxAGA121,,,  select the image and move it around
F977vuuxAGA121,,,  and you can move the text around a well
F977vuuxAGA121,,,  you do n't have to necessarily stick with
F977vuuxAGA121,,,  the exact
F977vuuxAGA122,26.59,27.1,  position of everything you know how
F977vuuxAGA122,,,  thing are set up in term of the
F977vuuxAGA122,,,  template so if you do n't like something
F977vuuxAGA122,,,  you know feel free to move it around you
F977vuuxAGA122,,,  can actually do that very very easily
F977vuuxAGA122,,,  with prezi now
F977vuuxAGA123,27.13,27.3,  let 's say we want to zoom in
F977vuuxAGA123,,,  we can actually zoom in but we can also
F977vuuxAGA123,,,  zoom out a well so let 's go back
F977vuuxAGA123,,,  out and go back to overview
F977vuuxAGA123,,,  and you might be wondering can you
F977vuuxAGA123,,,  actually you know move thing around
F977vuuxAGA124,27.32,27.42,  you know let 's say i do n't really want
F977vuuxAGA124,,,  this background here
F977vuuxAGA124,,,  let 's say i want my own background well
F977vuuxAGA124,,,  you can do that
F977vuuxAGA124,,,  by going back to the overview clicking
F977vuuxAGA124,,,  on background option
F977vuuxAGA125,27.44,27.55,  and you can either upload a background
F977vuuxAGA125,,,  image you can revert
F977vuuxAGA125,,,  to the template background if you make a
F977vuuxAGA125,,,  mistake you can
F977vuuxAGA125,,,  remove background image like so
F977vuuxAGA125,,,  or we can revert back to this so
F977vuuxAGA126,27.59,28.12,  one thing one place that i will tell you
F977vuuxAGA126,,,  to get your image from is
F977vuuxAGA126,,,  bigstockphoto.com
F977vuuxAGA126,,,  there are a lot of other place that you
F977vuuxAGA126,,,  can go to to get image a well
F977vuuxAGA126,,,  there are there 's pixabay.com there
F977vuuxAGA127,28.16,28.28,  is also pixel p e x
F977vuuxAGA127,,,  e l s dot com you can also get really
F977vuuxAGA127,,,  beautiful image there
F977vuuxAGA127,,,  royalty free one so obviously if you 're
F977vuuxAGA127,,,  doing this for
F977vuuxAGA127,,,  like business related you 're going to
F977vuuxAGA128,28.3,28.41,  want to get a commercial license so
F977vuuxAGA128,,,  you 're going to
F977vuuxAGA128,,,  need to pay for the image that you use
F977vuuxAGA128,,,  so with that said that aside if you
F977vuuxAGA128,,,  click upload background image let 's just
F977vuuxAGA128,,,  choose an image so
F977vuuxAGA129,28.44,28.59,  let 's go and let 's see here
F977vuuxAGA129,,,  let 's maybe choose
F977vuuxAGA129,,,  this one here so obviously this relates
F977vuuxAGA129,,,  to outsourcing but you can see these
F977vuuxAGA129,,,  have
F977vuuxAGA129,,,  little circle and that 's actually
F977vuuxAGA130,29.01,29.11,  really
F977vuuxAGA130,,,  convenient because i can actually move
F977vuuxAGA130,,,  these circle topic here so let 's say
F977vuuxAGA130,,,  for example
F977vuuxAGA130,,,  i want to move this here and i want to
F977vuuxAGA130,,,  make the circle a little bit bigger
F977vuuxAGA131,29.14,29.26,  so that it fit perfectly on this here
F977vuuxAGA131,,,  so obviously the finger
F977vuuxAGA131,,,  pointing here but i could put it over
F977vuuxAGA131,,,  here i could
F977vuuxAGA131,,,  you know put this over here and make it
F977vuuxAGA131,,,  bigger so it fit the circle perfectly
F977vuuxAGA132,29.28,29.46,  like that and i could do the same thing
F977vuuxAGA132,,,  over here
F977vuuxAGA132,,,  like so so a you can see you can move
F977vuuxAGA132,,,  the circle around now you 'll notice a
F977vuuxAGA132,,,  i move the circle around you
F977vuuxAGA132,,,  do you see those yellow line well those
F977vuuxAGA133,29.49,30.03,  yellow line are pointing
F977vuuxAGA133,,,  to the circle so depending on the order
F977vuuxAGA133,,,  that you have it in right now
F977vuuxAGA133,,,  is the order that it 'll go through if
F977vuuxAGA133,,,  you use the arrow the right arrow to
F977vuuxAGA133,,,  move forward
F977vuuxAGA134,30.04,30.16,  but you can obviously use the mouse to
F977vuuxAGA134,,,  select either or
F977vuuxAGA134,,,  whatever item that you want and go into
F977vuuxAGA134,,,  any order that you want but like i said
F977vuuxAGA134,,,  if you do want to go in order you can
F977vuuxAGA134,,,  and you can use the right arrow on your
F977vuuxAGA135,30.18,30.3,  keyboard to essentially go
F977vuuxAGA135,,,  from one two three four five six
F977vuuxAGA135,,,  but if i want to move let 's say for
F977vuuxAGA135,,,  example six to number two
F977vuuxAGA135,,,  i could easily do that and then of
F977vuuxAGA135,,,  course it switch
F977vuuxAGA136,30.32,30.42,  but i wanted to show you how easy it wa
F977vuuxAGA136,,,  see with the template
F977vuuxAGA136,,,  you have the opportunity like you do n't
F977vuuxAGA136,,,  have to use
F977vuuxAGA136,,,  the way the lay thing are laid out or
F977vuuxAGA136,,,  anything like that
F977vuuxAGA137,30.43,30.54,  you can actually tweak it to your own
F977vuuxAGA137,,,  liking
F977vuuxAGA137,,,  like that so there you go so you can see
F977vuuxAGA137,,,  that i tweaked it i
F977vuuxAGA137,,,  imported a background and that 's what it
F977vuuxAGA137,,,  look like
F977vuuxAGA138,30.55,31.05,  now within the subtopic excel you can
F977vuuxAGA138,,,  actually
F977vuuxAGA138,,,  edit just the same way select it double
F977vuuxAGA138,,,  click it
F977vuuxAGA138,,,  to edit the text and of course i can add
F977vuuxAGA138,,,  a subtopic remember you have two topic
F977vuuxAGA139,31.07,31.2,  type you have planet or stack
F977vuuxAGA139,,,  planet basically add the circle around
F977vuuxAGA139,,,  here so i could add
F977vuuxAGA139,,,  another subtopic and it 'll appear here
F977vuuxAGA139,,,  i can move it anywhere way i want i 'm
F977vuuxAGA139,,,  going to leave it a it is i can add
F977vuuxAGA140,31.21,31.36,  another subtopic
F977vuuxAGA140,,,  and another one like so
F977vuuxAGA140,,,  and of course if i want kind of a
F977vuuxAGA140,,,  powerpoint slide look
F977vuuxAGA140,,,  i can choose the stack a you can see
F977vuuxAGA140,,,  here so stack is going to look like this
F977vuuxAGA141,31.38,31.49,  where they zoom all the way further in
F977vuuxAGA141,,,  and it look like a powerpoint slide
F977vuuxAGA141,,,  and this is actually something that we
F977vuuxAGA141,,,  we did
F977vuuxAGA141,,,  for a while with prezi classic but
F977vuuxAGA141,,,  it 's not something that you could easily
F977vuuxAGA142,31.5,32.01,  do with prezi classic and that 's why i
F977vuuxAGA142,,,  recommend
F977vuuxAGA142,,,  if you 're new to all this stick with
F977vuuxAGA142,,,  prezi next all right
F977vuuxAGA142,,,  so that 's pretty much the premise on how
F977vuuxAGA142,,,  to use
F977vuuxAGA143,32.02,32.15,  prezi
F977vuuxAGA143,,,  okay so welcome to video number seven
F977vuuxAGA143,,,  and we
F977vuuxAGA143,,,  are gon na go ahead and jump right in and
F977vuuxAGA143,,,  talk about shortcut key
F977vuuxAGA143,,,  so shortcut key are basically key
F977vuuxAGA144,32.18,32.28,  within
F977vuuxAGA144,,,  prezi that have been programmed to allow
F977vuuxAGA144,,,  you to speed thing up
F977vuuxAGA144,,,  now you do n't really want to do this
F977vuuxAGA144,,,  until you get a hang of at least a few
F977vuuxAGA144,,,  template
F977vuuxAGA145,32.29,32.4,  but once you actually understand the
F977vuuxAGA145,,,  dashboard and
F977vuuxAGA145,,,  how everything is laid out then i
F977vuuxAGA145,,,  recommend using shortcut key
F977vuuxAGA145,,,  so that way you can just speed thing up
F977vuuxAGA145,,,  and
F977vuuxAGA146,32.41,32.52,  what would normally take you maybe 15
F977vuuxAGA146,,,  minute can now literally take you
F977vuuxAGA146,,,  a click of a button all right so that
F977vuuxAGA146,,,  said let 's
F977vuuxAGA146,,,  jump right in okay so let 's go ahead and
F977vuuxAGA146,,,  dive in
F977vuuxAGA147,32.53,33.03,  everybody want to eventually speed up
F977vuuxAGA147,,,  the process
F977vuuxAGA147,,,  nobody in that is watching this probably
F977vuuxAGA147,,,  want to do it the wrong way but like i
F977vuuxAGA147,,,  said
F977vuuxAGA147,,,  if you actually you know start out
F977vuuxAGA148,33.06,33.14,  working with template once you get a
F977vuuxAGA148,,,  hang of it
F977vuuxAGA148,,,  then i 'd highly recommend that you use
F977vuuxAGA148,,,  this that way you can understand the
F977vuuxAGA148,,,  whole process
F977vuuxAGA148,,,  of how everything work and that way
F977vuuxAGA149,33.16,33.26,  you 're
F977vuuxAGA149,,,  better equipped with knowing when to
F977vuuxAGA149,,,  actually use shortcut key
F977vuuxAGA149,,,  now you do n't have to remember the exact
F977vuuxAGA149,,,  key
F977vuuxAGA149,,,  i 'm going to show you an article from
F977vuuxAGA150,33.28,33.38,  prezi
F977vuuxAGA150,,,  where you 'll be able to get access to
F977vuuxAGA150,,,  this article and you know utilize
F977vuuxAGA150,,,  the shortcut key you can print out have
F977vuuxAGA150,,,  it on your wall so you can always refer
F977vuuxAGA150,,,  back to it later on
F977vuuxAGA151,33.4,33.53,  but for now i just want to show it to
F977vuuxAGA151,,,  you in action
F977vuuxAGA151,,,  so let 's say we
F977vuuxAGA151,,,  want to select everything that is on
F977vuuxAGA151,,,  this page so let 's do that so if you
F977vuuxAGA151,,,  click control a now obviously this is
F977vuuxAGA152,33.56,34.09,  going to be different
F977vuuxAGA152,,,  with mac computer it might be command
F977vuuxAGA152,,,  a but what i just did wa i selected
F977vuuxAGA152,,,  everything all the topic so control
F977vuuxAGA152,,,  a is select all and that 's pretty
F977vuuxAGA152,,,  standard with
F977vuuxAGA153,34.11,34.24,  most word processing or even browser
F977vuuxAGA153,,,  function is
F977vuuxAGA153,,,  ctrl a selects all by selecting all that
F977vuuxAGA153,,,  enables you to move thing around
F977vuuxAGA153,,,  a little bit better so instead of moving
F977vuuxAGA153,,,  item like little
F977vuuxAGA154,34.26,34.37,  topic one by one by one you can
F977vuuxAGA154,,,  literally select
F977vuuxAGA154,,,  everything and move it around so you can
F977vuuxAGA154,,,  select and move
F977vuuxAGA154,,,  here and move it here now
F977vuuxAGA154,,,  i could select all and i can also copy
F977vuuxAGA155,34.4,34.51,  by clicking control
F977vuuxAGA155,,,  c or command key and control v
F977vuuxAGA155,,,  which will basically copy everything
F977vuuxAGA155,,,  now i do n't see where you would actually
F977vuuxAGA155,,,  need to do that
F977vuuxAGA155,,,  unless you had a lot of these item
F977vuuxAGA156,34.54,35.05,  right
F977vuuxAGA156,,,  so if we were we wanted something
F977vuuxAGA156,,,  similar to this
F977vuuxAGA156,,,  maybe what we wanted to do is select
F977vuuxAGA156,,,  that item
F977vuuxAGA156,,,  so that 's number five
F977vuuxAGA157,35.1,35.23,  so let 's see here that 's this one here
F977vuuxAGA157,,,  so that 's the timeline so i could select
F977vuuxAGA157,,,  the timeline
F977vuuxAGA157,,,  i could do control c control v
F977vuuxAGA157,,,  and by doing control v you saw that now
F977vuuxAGA157,,,  it 's there 's a number seven
F977vuuxAGA158,35.25,35.35,  and it 's copied this exact element so if
F977vuuxAGA158,,,  you like an element and you want
F977vuuxAGA158,,,  to kind of base it upon that very
F977vuuxAGA158,,,  element because you 've done everything
F977vuuxAGA158,,,  right
F977vuuxAGA158,,,  then you can do control c and control v
F977vuuxAGA159,35.38,35.52,  alright now if i want to go further in
F977vuuxAGA159,,,  let 's say
F977vuuxAGA159,,,  let 's double click on this and we like
F977vuuxAGA159,,,  the way this is set up
F977vuuxAGA159,,,  and maybe we want another element
F977vuuxAGA159,,,  we could do control c control v or
F977vuuxAGA160,35.56,36.1,  maybe we just want to copy and paste
F977vuuxAGA160,,,  this
F977vuuxAGA160,,,  text right here so
F977vuuxAGA160,,,  you would want to select it like so
F977vuuxAGA160,,,  and you can see that i 've clicked
F977vuuxAGA160,,,  control c
F977vuuxAGA161,36.1,36.21,  control v i 've copied and pasted and you
F977vuuxAGA161,,,  can see
F977vuuxAGA161,,,  a duplicate so
F977vuuxAGA161,,,  let 's say for example we want this one
F977vuuxAGA161,,,  over here
F977vuuxAGA161,,,  so what you do is you want to select the
F977vuuxAGA162,36.24,36.34,  element so
F977vuuxAGA162,,,  if you look fairly carefully my mouse
F977vuuxAGA162,,,  go over
F977vuuxAGA162,,,  and this item highlight so
F977vuuxAGA162,,,  i can actually select the item and let 's
F977vuuxAGA162,,,  say i want to select this one this one
F977vuuxAGA163,36.36,36.47,  and this one
F977vuuxAGA163,,,  to do that i 'll need to hold down the
F977vuuxAGA163,,,  control
F977vuuxAGA163,,,  key
F977vuuxAGA163,,,  like that control c control v
F977vuuxAGA163,,,  and you can actually duplicate it and
F977vuuxAGA164,36.5,37.02,  there we go
F977vuuxAGA164,,,  so now i will say that took a little bit
F977vuuxAGA164,,,  of time to do that but i can move it
F977vuuxAGA164,,,  over here
F977vuuxAGA164,,,  i can move this over here like that
F977vuuxAGA164,,,  all right so that 's control c control v
F977vuuxAGA165,37.05,37.15,  which are probably the most common
F977vuuxAGA165,,,  shortcut key that you 're
F977vuuxAGA165,,,  actually going to use now let 's talk
F977vuuxAGA165,,,  about some other shortcut key
F977vuuxAGA165,,,  now i will say before you use keyboard
F977vuuxAGA165,,,  shortcut key
F977vuuxAGA166,37.17,37.28,  and you go to prezi and you search for
F977vuuxAGA166,,,  them you will notice that
F977vuuxAGA166,,,  some will say this support page is only
F977vuuxAGA166,,,  so there are some keyboard shortcut key
F977vuuxAGA166,,,  that are only for
F977vuuxAGA166,,,  prezi classic specifically so you only
F977vuuxAGA167,37.3,37.4,  want to do
F977vuuxAGA167,,,  the one that are for prezi next if
F977vuuxAGA167,,,  you 're using prezi next and the one for
F977vuuxAGA167,,,  prezi classic if you 're using prezi
F977vuuxAGA167,,,  classic
F977vuuxAGA167,,,  but a you can see here there are
F977vuuxAGA168,37.41,37.51,  different one for window and mac
F977vuuxAGA168,,,  obviously because there are different
F977vuuxAGA168,,,  key on the different platform and
F977vuuxAGA168,,,  different
F977vuuxAGA168,,,  computer but with window you can see
F977vuuxAGA168,,,  it 's ctrl a
F977vuuxAGA169,37.52,38.01,  with mac it 's ctrl a to select all ctrl
F977vuuxAGA169,,,  c
F977vuuxAGA169,,,  ctrl x is to cut it cut it mean that if
F977vuuxAGA169,,,  you
F977vuuxAGA169,,,  cut it it 'll disappear and then of
F977vuuxAGA169,,,  course you can copy it somewhere else
F977vuuxAGA170,38.05,38.15,  you can do all backspace to delete
F977vuuxAGA170,,,  you can do command and to drag thing
F977vuuxAGA170,,,  around
F977vuuxAGA170,,,  and there 's other element here a well
F977vuuxAGA170,,,  to move thing around
F977vuuxAGA170,,,  but for the most part you 're probably
F977vuuxAGA171,38.17,38.31,  going to use these
F977vuuxAGA171,,,  right here a this is more common
F977vuuxAGA171,,,  so to get here obviously let me give you
F977vuuxAGA171,,,  the url
F977vuuxAGA171,,,  of the link if you go to
F977vuuxAGA171,,,  slash www.prezi.com slash kb
F977vuuxAGA172,38.35,38.48,  slash create dash your dash
F977vuuxAGA172,,,  prezi no s so prezi
F977vuuxAGA172,,,  slash shortcut now if you want to just
F977vuuxAGA172,,,  go
F977vuuxAGA172,,,  to their database you can do that and do
F977vuuxAGA172,,,  a search just make sure
F977vuuxAGA173,38.5,39.01,  that it say this support page is about
F977vuuxAGA173,,,  prezi next
F977vuuxAGA173,,,  because there wa another keyboard
F977vuuxAGA173,,,  shortcut
F977vuuxAGA173,,,  page that wa specifically for the prezi
F977vuuxAGA173,,,  classic so i wanted to make mention of
F977vuuxAGA174,39.04,39.12,  that so
F977vuuxAGA174,,,  you do n't get confused you do n't learn
F977vuuxAGA174,,,  something that is
F977vuuxAGA174,,,  totally different and not related and
F977vuuxAGA174,,,  that way you do n't lose time
F977vuuxAGA174,,,  alright so with that said let 's move on
F977vuuxAGA175,39.14,39.29,  to the next video
F977vuuxAGA175,,,  hey and welcome back this is video
F977vuuxAGA175,,,  number eight and this is kind of a bonus
F977vuuxAGA175,,,  video but for those of you who want to
F977vuuxAGA175,,,  take it a step further and rather than
F977vuuxAGA175,,,  using prezi for just
F977vuuxAGA176,39.3,39.41,  something that sits out on the internet
F977vuuxAGA176,,,  or something
F977vuuxAGA176,,,  for a live presentation for those of you
F977vuuxAGA176,,,  who want to make an actual video
F977vuuxAGA176,,,  this is for you alright so we 're going
F977vuuxAGA176,,,  to talk about how to add
F977vuuxAGA177,39.42,39.55,  voiceovers how to add background sound
F977vuuxAGA177,,,  how to essentially make a video
F977vuuxAGA177,,,  but for those of you who really want to
F977vuuxAGA177,,,  go all out and
F977vuuxAGA177,,,  you 're you 're not really looking to make
F977vuuxAGA177,,,  a prezi to just do
F977vuuxAGA178,39.56,40.08,  a live kind of presentation
F977vuuxAGA178,,,  or just send it to people you really
F977vuuxAGA178,,,  want to turn this into a video
F977vuuxAGA178,,,  then you are going to need to have an
F977vuuxAGA178,,,  actual
F977vuuxAGA178,,,  video recording software so in this case
F977vuuxAGA179,40.11,40.24,  i am using camtasia you can use
F977vuuxAGA179,,,  screenflow for mac
F977vuuxAGA179,,,  there are other apps out there a well
F977vuuxAGA179,,,  but for the most part i found
F977vuuxAGA179,,,  camtasia tends to be the best
F977vuuxAGA179,,,  i 've tested camtasia on the mac i really
F977vuuxAGA180,40.26,40.36,  like it i feel like it ha
F977vuuxAGA180,,,  evolved and become better
F977vuuxAGA180,,,  and maybe it 's just a little bit of a
F977vuuxAGA180,,,  preference but i 've used camtasia for a
F977vuuxAGA180,,,  long time
F977vuuxAGA180,,,  and that 's what i use now
F977vuuxAGA181,40.4,40.54,  here 's the thing here 's a little trick i
F977vuuxAGA181,,,  found you can use
F977vuuxAGA181,,,  browser or you can use the window or
F977vuuxAGA181,,,  the mac app now when it came to
F977vuuxAGA181,,,  classic prezi i found that utilizing the
F977vuuxAGA181,,,  actual
F977vuuxAGA182,40.55,41.08,  downloadable window or mac app wa
F977vuuxAGA182,,,  easier
F977vuuxAGA182,,,  but that time have changed
F977vuuxAGA182,,,  and if you click on prezi and we go with
F977vuuxAGA182,,,  prezi next and click on present
F977vuuxAGA182,,,  this is what it look like so in reality
F977vuuxAGA183,41.11,41.27,  i found that they 've made prezi next
F977vuuxAGA183,,,  very very easy to use and
F977vuuxAGA183,,,  you can either use a browser version or
F977vuuxAGA183,,,  you can use the window or mac app
F977vuuxAGA183,,,  so if you 're now if you 're using the
F977vuuxAGA183,,,  classic prezi
F977vuuxAGA184,41.29,41.43,  then what i found is it 's just easier
F977vuuxAGA184,,,  to use the downloadable window or mac
F977vuuxAGA184,,,  app if you 're using prezi next it
F977vuuxAGA184,,,  doe n't matter
F977vuuxAGA184,,,  use browser or you can also use the
F977vuuxAGA184,,,  downloadable app
F977vuuxAGA185,41.45,41.58,  both actually work so
F977vuuxAGA185,,,  learn from me because you know i 've
F977vuuxAGA185,,,  recorded many video
F977vuuxAGA185,,,  and since then made a lot of prezis
F977vuuxAGA185,,,  and the prezis are the classic prezis
F977vuuxAGA185,,,  were actually very difficult
F977vuuxAGA186,41.59,42.1,  to record because a lot of time the
F977vuuxAGA186,,,  reason why wa a lot of time
F977vuuxAGA186,,,  the browser app thing would just get in
F977vuuxAGA186,,,  the way
F977vuuxAGA186,,,  and it 'd be really hard to record so i
F977vuuxAGA186,,,  think thing have evolved over the year
F977vuuxAGA187,42.13,42.25,  but
F977vuuxAGA187,,,  that said you will need to have
F977vuuxAGA187,,,  camtasia or screenflow so in order to do
F977vuuxAGA187,,,  this
F977vuuxAGA187,,,  you will need obviously to dish out
F977vuuxAGA187,,,  either 150 to 300
F977vuuxAGA188,42.29,42.39,  to get access to these software you
F977vuuxAGA188,,,  will also need to have
F977vuuxAGA188,,,  a microphone either a usb microphone or
F977vuuxAGA188,,,  a more professional microphone
F977vuuxAGA188,,,  i believe with mac computer you can
F977vuuxAGA188,,,  easily use
F977vuuxAGA189,42.4,42.53,  the the microphone earbuds you can use
F977vuuxAGA189,,,  those a well
F977vuuxAGA189,,,  to record a video but all you do is just
F977vuuxAGA189,,,  go into presentation mode
F977vuuxAGA189,,,  now that you have an idea of prezi
F977vuuxAGA189,,,  classic versus prezi next
F977vuuxAGA190,42.56,43.07,  all you have to do is click present
F977vuuxAGA190,,,  now you 'll notice that if i put my mouse
F977vuuxAGA190,,,  down here this little thing pop up and
F977vuuxAGA190,,,  then
F977vuuxAGA190,,,  you 're wondering okay how do i get rid
F977vuuxAGA190,,,  of this little bar so to get rid of it
F977vuuxAGA191,43.1,43.19,  you just put your mouse
F977vuuxAGA191,,,  back up here and you click so you can
F977vuuxAGA191,,,  see that my mouse is
F977vuuxAGA191,,,  is hiding so before actually when i wa
F977vuuxAGA191,,,  recording the other video
F977vuuxAGA191,,,  my mouse wa over here and it wa hiding
F977vuuxAGA192,43.22,43.37,  so that 's kind of how to do
F977vuuxAGA192,,,  it now with camtasia let me go over to
F977vuuxAGA192,,,  camtasia
F977vuuxAGA192,,,  you are going to want to use
F977vuuxAGA192,,,  and i ca n't really show that now but
F977vuuxAGA192,,,  you 're going to click on record the
F977vuuxAGA193,43.38,43.47,  screen
F977vuuxAGA193,,,  and you want to use full screen so you
F977vuuxAGA193,,,  want to show or record
F977vuuxAGA193,,,  the whole screen and then typically
F977vuuxAGA193,,,  after that once you have recorded it you
F977vuuxAGA193,,,  want to get it down to
F977vuuxAGA194,43.49,44.02,  1280 by 720 editing dimension which is
F977vuuxAGA194,,,  hd quality standard and
F977vuuxAGA194,,,  another thing is depending on how big
F977vuuxAGA194,,,  your resolution is
F977vuuxAGA194,,,  if your resolution is a smaller
F977vuuxAGA194,,,  resolution
F977vuuxAGA195,44.04,44.13,  you might have kind of a little bit of a
F977vuuxAGA195,,,  distorted view
F977vuuxAGA195,,,  and you might need to kind of play
F977vuuxAGA195,,,  around with that but when it come to
F977vuuxAGA195,,,  editing
F977vuuxAGA195,,,  let 's say for this one here if and when
F977vuuxAGA196,44.17,44.28,  you have element that are like popping
F977vuuxAGA196,,,  up or in the way
F977vuuxAGA196,,,  you can use the zoom and pan feature and
F977vuuxAGA196,,,  you go here
F977vuuxAGA196,,,  and you just move it up like that so you
F977vuuxAGA196,,,  can move it up
F977vuuxAGA197,44.29,44.39,  obviously it crop out certain element
F977vuuxAGA197,,,  of the actual video
F977vuuxAGA197,,,  but then you remove the element that
F977vuuxAGA197,,,  are popping in and all that so
F977vuuxAGA197,,,  that 's something good to know i mean
F977vuuxAGA197,,,  i 've made so many pretty video over the
F977vuuxAGA198,44.41,44.5,  year that
F977vuuxAGA198,,,  i 've realized there are certain element
F977vuuxAGA198,,,  certain thing that
F977vuuxAGA198,,,  you 'll run into along the way that
F977vuuxAGA198,,,  you 'll never really know
F977vuuxAGA198,,,  unless you actually do it so like i said
F977vuuxAGA199,44.52,45.05,  you got to do it a few time
F977vuuxAGA199,,,  sometimes a few time sometimes 10 time
F977vuuxAGA199,,,  sometimes 20 time until you perfect
F977vuuxAGA199,,,  your own process but that 's fine that 's
F977vuuxAGA199,,,  that 's part of the game
F977vuuxAGA199,,,  and at the end of the day you know some
F977vuuxAGA200,45.07,45.2,  of your video that start out
F977vuuxAGA200,,,  maybe slow now some people ask okay
F977vuuxAGA200,,,  when you make video do you just uh
F977vuuxAGA200,,,  record
F977vuuxAGA200,,,  the voice first and then you kind of
F977vuuxAGA200,,,  show
F977vuuxAGA201,45.21,45.32,  the prezi in action or do you
F977vuuxAGA201,,,  actually walk through while you 're
F977vuuxAGA201,,,  showing the prezi
F977vuuxAGA201,,,  what i found to answer that it 's
F977vuuxAGA201,,,  different from different
F977vuuxAGA201,,,  people some people can do you know teach
F977vuuxAGA202,45.34,45.47,  really really fast
F977vuuxAGA202,,,  and a they do the prezi and some people
F977vuuxAGA202,,,  a they start out they have to actually
F977vuuxAGA202,,,  read a script and then implement it and
F977vuuxAGA202,,,  have one track a the audio and one
F977vuuxAGA202,,,  track
F977vuuxAGA203,45.47,45.59,  a the prezi visual so sometimes you
F977vuuxAGA203,,,  might have to write out the script
F977vuuxAGA203,,,  and read the script and put it down here
F977vuuxAGA203,,,  and then you have to go back
F977vuuxAGA203,,,  and then record kind of the video
F977vuuxAGA203,,,  of the prezi and go along with the
F977vuuxAGA204,46.01,46.1,  script so
F977vuuxAGA204,,,  it really depends on you and how you
F977vuuxAGA204,,,  speak some of you might be comfortable
F977vuuxAGA204,,,  with speaking like like me i can just go
F977vuuxAGA204,,,  straight in and teach
F977vuuxAGA204,,,  and some of you might not be comfortable
F977vuuxAGA205,46.12,46.24,  and you might have to go with a script
F977vuuxAGA205,,,  now i will say you know it definitely
F977vuuxAGA205,,,  take practice
F977vuuxAGA205,,,  and even sometimes making video
F977vuuxAGA205,,,  it might be the tenth time but at the
F977vuuxAGA205,,,  end of the day you have to practice
F977vuuxAGA206,46.26,46.39,  just like riding a bicycle everything
F977vuuxAGA206,,,  take practice
F977vuuxAGA206,,,  so hopefully that teach you a little
F977vuuxAGA206,,,  bit about how to turn your prezi
F977vuuxAGA206,,,  into a video
F977vuuxAGA206,,,  so congratulation you have reached the
F977vuuxAGA207,46.42,46.49,  end of
F977vuuxAGA207,,,  this video course which is video number
F977vuuxAGA207,,,  nine and
F977vuuxAGA207,,,  in video number nine it 's going to be a
F977vuuxAGA207,,,  fairly brief
F977vuuxAGA207,,,  video but i want to show you how to
F977vuuxAGA208,46.51,47.04,  collaborate via prezi
F977vuuxAGA208,,,  and how to reach out to your team how to
F977vuuxAGA208,,,  get your team to even work on the prezi
F977vuuxAGA208,,,  and how to use prezi for
F977vuuxAGA208,,,  other thing besides of that and
F977vuuxAGA208,,,  let 's go ahead and dive in
F977vuuxAGA209,47.08,47.18,  so there are different way to have your
F977vuuxAGA209,,,  team
F977vuuxAGA209,,,  collaborate on a prezi you can have them
F977vuuxAGA209,,,  edit the prezi
F977vuuxAGA209,,,  and build it out together or you can
F977vuuxAGA209,,,  just have them come in
F977vuuxAGA210,47.2,47.3,  and view the prezi so this feature is
F977vuuxAGA210,,,  actually very simple to use all you have
F977vuuxAGA210,,,  to do is up at the top right hand corner
F977vuuxAGA210,,,  you 're going to see this little people
F977vuuxAGA210,,,  icon
F977vuuxAGA210,,,  you want to click that and then you can
F977vuuxAGA211,47.32,47.41,  see that
F977vuuxAGA211,,,  currently there are currently no
F977vuuxAGA211,,,  collaborator in this prezi
F977vuuxAGA211,,,  so what you want to do is click on total
F977vuuxAGA211,,,  collaborator
F977vuuxAGA211,,,  you 'll want to enter their email address
F977vuuxAGA212,47.45,47.54,  and then before you click on add there
F977vuuxAGA212,,,  are different option here you can
F977vuuxAGA212,,,  edit so in other word you can give
F977vuuxAGA212,,,  somebody
F977vuuxAGA212,,,  edit right you may not want to do that
F977vuuxAGA212,,,  unless
F977vuuxAGA213,47.55,48.05,  uh that person is somebody you trust you
F977vuuxAGA213,,,  can
F977vuuxAGA213,,,  have somebody comment so they can make
F977vuuxAGA213,,,  comment on the prezi itself
F977vuuxAGA213,,,  so maybe this is a presentation to a
F977vuuxAGA213,,,  client
F977vuuxAGA214,48.06,48.16,  you might want to just give them you
F977vuuxAGA214,,,  know presentation right
F977vuuxAGA214,,,  so essentially these are right that you
F977vuuxAGA214,,,  can give
F977vuuxAGA214,,,  so if you want somebody like your
F977vuuxAGA214,,,  universal assistant
F977vuuxAGA215,48.18,48.29,  or your somebody employee or somebody on
F977vuuxAGA215,,,  your team
F977vuuxAGA215,,,  you might want to give them edit right
F977vuuxAGA215,,,  and then the can
F977vuuxAGA215,,,  comment and then can present is somebody
F977vuuxAGA215,,,  who
F977vuuxAGA216,48.3,48.41,  might be a client might be somebody
F977vuuxAGA216,,,  presenting it maybe you do n't really
F977vuuxAGA216,,,  want them to have
F977vuuxAGA216,,,  those edit right because keep in mind
F977vuuxAGA216,,,  if you do give somebody edit right
F977vuuxAGA216,,,  they have the ability to literally ruin
F977vuuxAGA217,48.43,48.52,  your whole prezi so
F977vuuxAGA217,,,  just give somebody that you trust those
F977vuuxAGA217,,,  right
F977vuuxAGA217,,,  and that 's how easy it is to use and of
F977vuuxAGA217,,,  course besides collaboration you have
F977vuuxAGA217,,,  the ability to share
F977vuuxAGA219,48.53,49.34,  and you can create a link you can
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  enter the company or the
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  client 's name in here you click create
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  link
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  and you can also track prezi analytics
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  and more but for the most part for
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  collaborates you 're going to use the
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  show collaborator button
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  and that 's it you 're good to go
F977vuuxAGA219,,,  you
kw_udjD2xwo1,0.09,0.32,  If you really want to add some excitement to your presentation try adding some animation .
kw_udjD2xwo1,,,  PowerPoint ha a wide variety of animated effect that can be applied to text and other
kw_udjD2xwo1,,,  object .
kw_udjD2xwo1,,,  In this example I 'm creating a very basic quiz that ha a question on each slide .
kw_udjD2xwo1,,,  I 'd like to add animation to these two text box ... and also the man on top of the moon .
kw_udjD2xwo1,,,  To get started select the first object you want you want to animate ... then go to the
kw_udjD2xwo2,0.37,0.55,  Animations tab .
kw_udjD2xwo2,,,  Next click the drop down arrow to see all the available effect .
kw_udjD2xwo2,,,  There are four different category : Entrance which will happen when the object
kw_udjD2xwo2,,,  first appears ...
kw_udjD2xwo2,,,  Emphasis which happens while the object is on the slide ...
kw_udjD2xwo2,,,  Exit which will cause the object to disappear ...
kw_udjD2xwo3,0.59,1.24,  And Motion Paths which will move the object along a path .
kw_udjD2xwo3,,,  I 'm going to choose the one called Fly In which is an Entrance effect .
kw_udjD2xwo3,,,  For some effect you 'll have different Effect Options that you can choose from .
kw_udjD2xwo3,,,  As you can see this one let you change the direction .
kw_udjD2xwo3,,,  Let 's say I wanted to add second animation to the text .
kw_udjD2xwo3,,,  If we try to select one from the main menu it 's actually going to replace the current
kw_udjD2xwo4,1.28,1.47,  effect .
kw_udjD2xwo4,,,  Instead we 'll click the command that say Add Animation ... and we can apply additional
kw_udjD2xwo4,,,  effect to the same object .
kw_udjD2xwo4,,,  You can always tell which object have animation because they 'll have little number next to
kw_udjD2xwo4,,,  them—one for each effect .
kw_udjD2xwo4,,,  The thumbnail for the slide will also have a star icon .
kw_udjD2xwo5,1.51,2.14,  If you want to preview the effect just click the Preview command any time .
kw_udjD2xwo5,,,  Now the key to using animation effectively is moderation .
kw_udjD2xwo5,,,  Say we wanted to add an effect to the answer text a well .
kw_udjD2xwo5,,,  We do n't want anything too bold like say the Swivel effect because it might be distracting
kw_udjD2xwo5,,,  to the audience .
kw_udjD2xwo5,,,  Instead I 'm just going to set it to slowly fade in which should really help the answer
kw_udjD2xwo6,2.19,2.41,  shine .
kw_udjD2xwo6,,,  It 's also important to note that not every object need an animation .
kw_udjD2xwo6,,,  This is especially true in more corporate or professional setting .
kw_udjD2xwo6,,,  In this case we 're creating a fairly casual presentation—so I 'm going to add one more
kw_udjD2xwo6,,,  effect to our little astronaut but leave the rest of the slide alone .
kw_udjD2xwo6,,,  At this point we have several animation to keep track of so it might be a good time
kw_udjD2xwo7,2.48,3.07,  to open the Animation Pane .
kw_udjD2xwo7,,,  The pane appears on the right and let you do a few different thing .
kw_udjD2xwo7,,,  You can click and drag the effect to change the order that they play in ... and you can
kw_udjD2xwo7,,,  use the drop arrow to access even more option .
kw_udjD2xwo7,,,  By default animation are set to start when you click the mouse but I do n't want to have
kw_udjD2xwo7,,,  to do that for every single one .
kw_udjD2xwo8,3.09,3.37,  Instead we can have some of them start automatically either with the previous effect or after .
kw_udjD2xwo8,,,  I 'm going to choose After for everything but the very first animation .
kw_udjD2xwo8,,,  That way they 'll all play one after the other a soon a we click the mouse .
kw_udjD2xwo8,,,  If you go back to the drop arrow ... and then choose Effect Options from the menu ...
kw_udjD2xwo8,,,  you 'll get a dialog box where you can really fine the effect .
kw_udjD2xwo8,,,  Some of these option will vary depending on the specific animation you 're working with .
kw_udjD2xwo9,3.41,4.02,  For example with this animation ... we can set the answer to fade in all at once one
kw_udjD2xwo9,,,  word at a time or one letter at a time .
kw_udjD2xwo9,,,  I want a little bit more flair so I 'm going to go ahead and choose by letter .
kw_udjD2xwo9,,,  If we go to the Timing tab ... we can adjust thing like the speed of the effect and whether
kw_udjD2xwo9,,,  or not it repeat .
kw_udjD2xwo9,,,  I 'm going to add a tiny bit of delay to give the audience more time to think of the answer .
kw_udjD2xwo10,4.1,4.35,  And that look perfect !
kw_udjD2xwo10,,,  Now I 'm going to play the entire slide show so we can see the finished product .
kw_udjD2xwo10,,,  We 'll just click the mouse to trigger the first effect ... which trigger the next one
kw_udjD2xwo10,,,  automatically ... and then the next one .
kw_udjD2xwo10,,,  I really like the way the answer animation turned out so I 'd like to use the same one
kw_udjD2xwo10,,,  on the other question slide .
kw_udjD2xwo12,4.37,5.13,  Luckily we do n't have to go through all the step again—we can just copy and paste the
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  effect from one object to another .
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  First select the object whose animation you want to copy ... then click the command that
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  say Animation Painter .
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  Next click whatever object you want to add the effect to ... and now it fade in in exactly
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  the same way .
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  We 're well on our way to creating a fun practice quiz .
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  With just a few animation you can turn a simple slide show into something interesting
kw_udjD2xwo12,,,  and engaging .
GGjacTn_9ts1,0.04,0.14,  designing effective visual aid for
GGjacTn_9ts1,,,  presentation it wa n't too long ago
GGjacTn_9ts1,,,  when the only people at a place of
GGjacTn_9ts1,,,  business who had access to desktop
GGjacTn_9ts1,,,  publishing software package with the
GGjacTn_9ts1,,,  computer genius and design guru back
GGjacTn_9ts2,0.17,0.27,  then you had to work side by side with
GGjacTn_9ts2,,,  one of those trained professional in
GGjacTn_9ts2,,,  order to design visual aid for a
GGjacTn_9ts2,,,  business presentation the software wa
GGjacTn_9ts2,,,  expensive difficult to access and tricky
GGjacTn_9ts2,,,  to use today all of that ha changed
GGjacTn_9ts3,0.3,0.41,  with presentation software package like
GGjacTn_9ts3,,,  PowerPoint and Keynote installed on
GGjacTn_9ts3,,,  nearly every computer at home and school
GGjacTn_9ts3,,,  and in the office we all have easy
GGjacTn_9ts3,,,  access to the user product the
GGjacTn_9ts3,,,  business community expects it employee
GGjacTn_9ts4,0.43,0.55,  to be able to utilize the program when
GGjacTn_9ts4,,,  presenting information however just
GGjacTn_9ts4,,,  because we have access to the program
GGjacTn_9ts4,,,  doe n't mean we all do a good job of
GGjacTn_9ts4,,,  using that program well in the hand of
GGjacTn_9ts4,,,  the unskilled student the numerous
GGjacTn_9ts5,0.57,1.07,  gee feature of PowerPoint and
GGjacTn_9ts5,,,  Keynote can result in load of
GGjacTn_9ts5,,,  teeny text in hard to read font on
GGjacTn_9ts5,,,  top of unprofessional design template
GGjacTn_9ts5,,,  and the use of too many piece of
GGjacTn_9ts5,,,  generic clipart in this tutorial you
GGjacTn_9ts6,1.11,1.2,  will be reminded of basic design
GGjacTn_9ts6,,,  technique that will help you avoid the
GGjacTn_9ts6,,,  mistake that make you look
GGjacTn_9ts6,,,  unprofessional and feel le confident
GGjacTn_9ts6,,,  in your presentation before we address
GGjacTn_9ts6,,,  basic design tip to consider please
GGjacTn_9ts7,1.22,1.32,  remember that your message is more
GGjacTn_9ts7,,,  important than the visual do n't spend so
GGjacTn_9ts7,,,  much time designing the visual aid that
GGjacTn_9ts7,,,  you forget to organize your thought and
GGjacTn_9ts7,,,  do proper research on the verbal portion
GGjacTn_9ts7,,,  of the presentation a visual aid whether
GGjacTn_9ts8,1.36,1.49,  it 's PowerPoint a trifold board a prop
GGjacTn_9ts8,,,  or a handout is just that and aid these
GGjacTn_9ts8,,,  aid enhance a presentation and should
GGjacTn_9ts8,,,  not become the presentation we will
GGjacTn_9ts8,,,  first discus the process of deciding
GGjacTn_9ts8,,,  what a good visual aid could be and then
GGjacTn_9ts9,1.52,2.03,  you will consider three aspect of
GGjacTn_9ts9,,,  design what idea need to be highlighted
GGjacTn_9ts9,,,  visually for example do I have
GGjacTn_9ts9,,,  photograph of the product which piece
GGjacTn_9ts9,,,  of the product need to be photographed
GGjacTn_9ts9,,,  do I need to take the product apart and
GGjacTn_9ts10,2.06,2.19,  photograph the piece what statistic
GGjacTn_9ts10,,,  need to be shown what key point do I
GGjacTn_9ts10,,,  need to emphasize there 's a pie chart or
GGjacTn_9ts10,,,  our chart better emphasize what I need
GGjacTn_9ts10,,,  to tell the audience go through each
GGjacTn_9ts10,,,  main point of the presentation and make
GGjacTn_9ts11,2.21,2.32,  a general list of what important item
GGjacTn_9ts11,,,  the audience need to know keep in mind
GGjacTn_9ts11,,,  not everything on your list may make the
GGjacTn_9ts11,,,  final slide deck while showing the
GGjacTn_9ts11,,,  information on the slide enhance or
GGjacTn_9ts11,,,  detract from my message what you are
GGjacTn_9ts12,2.34,2.46,  trying to think about here is keeping
GGjacTn_9ts12,,,  the information on your slide a simple
GGjacTn_9ts12,,,  a possible remember the old phrase kiss
GGjacTn_9ts12,,,  keep it simple sweetheart that old
GGjacTn_9ts12,,,  phrase applies here go back through the
GGjacTn_9ts12,,,  list you just made and be critical ask
GGjacTn_9ts13,2.48,3.02,  yourself if that photo chart or sentence
GGjacTn_9ts13,,,  need to be shown or will it serve a a
GGjacTn_9ts13,,,  distraction to the audience how many
GGjacTn_9ts13,,,  slide are necessary again keep it
GGjacTn_9ts13,,,  simple if you are not required to have a
GGjacTn_9ts13,,,  certain number of slide consider this
GGjacTn_9ts14,3.04,3.15,  you only really need one slide per major
GGjacTn_9ts14,,,  element in the presentation for example
GGjacTn_9ts14,,,  one slide during the introduction one
GGjacTn_9ts14,,,  slide for each main point that you
GGjacTn_9ts14,,,  discus and a final slide for the
GGjacTn_9ts14,,,  conclusion keeping the number of slide
GGjacTn_9ts15,3.17,3.28,  to a minimum keep the focus on you and
GGjacTn_9ts15,,,  the key idea of your message once you
GGjacTn_9ts15,,,  have determined what would be good to
GGjacTn_9ts15,,,  show your audience a you are speaking
GGjacTn_9ts15,,,  you need to focus on design while
GGjacTn_9ts15,,,  everyone ha a slightly different idea
GGjacTn_9ts16,3.3,3.42,  of what good design really is there are
GGjacTn_9ts16,,,  three Universal idea that apply to
GGjacTn_9ts16,,,  every presentation first consistency
GGjacTn_9ts16,,,  choose a template that provides
GGjacTn_9ts16,,,  excellent readability a professional
GGjacTn_9ts16,,,  color scheme and is appropriate to the
GGjacTn_9ts17,3.44,3.55,  tone of your message for example a
GGjacTn_9ts17,,,  presentation with the serious tone may
GGjacTn_9ts17,,,  utilize dark background color such a
GGjacTn_9ts17,,,  black or navy blue while presentation
GGjacTn_9ts17,,,  with a light tone may utilize
GGjacTn_9ts17,,,  light background color such a green
GGjacTn_9ts18,3.57,4.11,  and light blue not every template
GGjacTn_9ts18,,,  offered with the PowerPoint and Keynote
GGjacTn_9ts18,,,  software fit these characteristic some
GGjacTn_9ts18,,,  good example are adjacency clarity
GGjacTn_9ts18,,,  Technic and urban these template are
GGjacTn_9ts18,,,  clean easy to read and have professional
GGjacTn_9ts19,4.14,4.27,  color scheme some not so good example
GGjacTn_9ts19,,,  are autumn Couture opulent and verb
GGjacTn_9ts19,,,  these design template utilize hard to
GGjacTn_9ts19,,,  read background color are extremely
GGjacTn_9ts19,,,  busy and are professional in nature
GGjacTn_9ts19,,,  whichever template you
GGjacTn_9ts20,4.28,4.4,  select be consistent with it and utilize
GGjacTn_9ts20,,,  that one template throughout the entire
GGjacTn_9ts20,,,  slideshow utilize the same color and
GGjacTn_9ts20,,,  font throughout the slideshow selecting
GGjacTn_9ts20,,,  one font like Helvetica for the header
GGjacTn_9ts20,,,  and another Times New Roman for example
GGjacTn_9ts21,4.43,4.55,  for the text is acceptable but you
GGjacTn_9ts21,,,  should stick with those in the same
GGjacTn_9ts21,,,  order throughout second readability make
GGjacTn_9ts21,,,  sure that the design template you select
GGjacTn_9ts21,,,  us contrasting color for readability
GGjacTn_9ts21,,,  example purple slide not all design
GGjacTn_9ts22,4.59,5.1,  template use large enough type size and
GGjacTn_9ts22,,,  it 's bullet point any type size le
GGjacTn_9ts22,,,  than 28 point type is too small
GGjacTn_9ts22,,,  double check your size just throughout
GGjacTn_9ts22,,,  the document and if needed manually
GGjacTn_9ts22,,,  select a larger type size and make sure
GGjacTn_9ts23,5.12,5.24,  that your size are consistent if you
GGjacTn_9ts23,,,  have a chance you may want to test it
GGjacTn_9ts23,,,  out in a room you will be using stand in
GGjacTn_9ts23,,,  the back and see if you can read the
GGjacTn_9ts23,,,  text clearly and without squinting not
GGjacTn_9ts23,,,  all photograph downloaded from the
GGjacTn_9ts24,5.25,5.36,  internet appear perfect when inserted
GGjacTn_9ts24,,,  into PowerPoint what look good in a
GGjacTn_9ts24,,,  smaller version may become bitmapped or
GGjacTn_9ts24,,,  blurry when enlarged on a PowerPoint
GGjacTn_9ts24,,,  slide take the time to find a clear
GGjacTn_9ts24,,,  photo avoid large complicated chart if
GGjacTn_9ts25,5.39,5.5,  you need to include such a chart in your
GGjacTn_9ts25,,,  presentation it may be best to hand it
GGjacTn_9ts25,,,  out instead of forcing people to squint
GGjacTn_9ts25,,,  to determine which slice of a pie chart '
GGjacTn_9ts25,,,  go with what color and width what that
GGjacTn_9ts25,,,  represents stick to the basic Helvetica
GGjacTn_9ts26,5.54,6.08,  Calibri Verdana and Arial for heading
GGjacTn_9ts26,,,  and chart label and Times New Roman
GGjacTn_9ts26,,,  Bookman Garamond and Palatino for bullet point 
GGjacTn_9ts26,,,  most magazine newspaper and
GGjacTn_9ts26,,,  book utilize a similar system to ensure
GGjacTn_9ts26,,,  readability avoid using all capital
GGjacTn_9ts27,6.11,6.21,  letter standard capitalization is
GGjacTn_9ts27,,,  easier to read wo n't tire your
GGjacTn_9ts27,,,  audience 's eye and your audience wo n't
GGjacTn_9ts27,,,  think you are screaming at them the rule
GGjacTn_9ts27,,,  of seven still applies we 're needing to
GGjacTn_9ts27,,,  utilize a lot of text on a PowerPoint
GGjacTn_9ts28,6.23,6.35,  slide remember it is best to corral this
GGjacTn_9ts28,,,  text with seven word on a bullet point
GGjacTn_9ts28,,,  seven bullet point per slide this
GGjacTn_9ts28,,,  force you to think short and simple how
GGjacTn_9ts28,,,  do you only have seven word on a bullet
GGjacTn_9ts28,,,  point easy do n't use the entire sentence
GGjacTn_9ts29,6.38,6.5,  use phrase third professional even if
GGjacTn_9ts29,,,  you want
GGjacTn_9ts29,,,  design guru there are a few simple
GGjacTn_9ts29,,,  trick to think about when designing
GGjacTn_9ts29,,,  presentation visuals use clipart or
GGjacTn_9ts29,,,  photography that 's relevant to your
GGjacTn_9ts30,6.51,7.03,  message professional in scope and is
GGjacTn_9ts30,,,  fairly consistent in tone throughout
GGjacTn_9ts30,,,  have the clipart or photograph lead
GGjacTn_9ts30,,,  to the text employ simple animation
GGjacTn_9ts30,,,  scheme throughout here 's where many get
GGjacTn_9ts30,,,  in trouble with PowerPoint and Keynote
GGjacTn_9ts31,7.04,7.16,  both of these software system offer
GGjacTn_9ts31,,,  dozen of way to make the text zoom fly
GGjacTn_9ts31,,,  float wipe and spin into a slideshow
GGjacTn_9ts31,,,  however these animation are way too
GGjacTn_9ts31,,,  distracting
GGjacTn_9ts31,,,  yes it is a good idea to utilize a
GGjacTn_9ts32,7.18,7.29,  simple animation scheme to place one
GGjacTn_9ts32,,,  bullet point or one photo on the screen
GGjacTn_9ts32,,,  exactly at the time it is needed it 's a
GGjacTn_9ts32,,,  great way to bring attention to one item
GGjacTn_9ts32,,,  and the audience doe n't feel compelled
GGjacTn_9ts32,,,  to read or look at everything on your
GGjacTn_9ts33,7.31,7.43,  slide before you actually bring their
GGjacTn_9ts33,,,  attention to it however keep this
GGjacTn_9ts33,,,  animation simple using a peer is the
GGjacTn_9ts33,,,  simplest way to accomplish this thinking
GGjacTn_9ts33,,,  about these three design concept
GGjacTn_9ts33,,,  consistency readability and
GGjacTn_9ts33,,,  consistency readability and
GGjacTn_9ts34,7.45,7.57,  professionalism and taking the time to
GGjacTn_9ts34,,,  think about your visual aid can make a
GGjacTn_9ts34,,,  huge positive impact on how you are
GGjacTn_9ts34,,,  perceived a a presenter however please
GGjacTn_9ts34,,,  remember that no amount of fancy slide
GGjacTn_9ts34,,,  effect and animation scheme can
GGjacTn_9ts36,7.59,8.21,  overcome poor preparation if you do n't
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  do your job in research and organization
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  not even a smartly designed PowerPoint
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  and Keynote will save visit the
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  communication Success Center in room 138
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  of the Fine Arts Center for one
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  assistance and advice in this topic or
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  any other aspect of public speaking
GGjacTn_9ts36,,,  you
MdLMLMzudbM1,0.01,0.12,  mark pen can be used for producing
MdLMLMzudbM1,,,  highly realistic presentation drawing
MdLMLMzudbM1,,,  of product but here we 're using them
MdLMLMzudbM1,,,  for quickly adding information to our
MdLMLMzudbM1,,,  design idea to help convey our thought
MdLMLMzudbM1,,,  to a third party
MdLMLMzudbM2,0.19,0.37,  marker pen come in a big range of
MdLMLMzudbM2,,,  color but they also come in a range of
MdLMLMzudbM2,,,  tone here we 're looking at a range of
MdLMLMzudbM2,,,  gray tone and you can see that with
MdLMLMzudbM2,,,  each pen the gray is a tone darker
MdLMLMzudbM2,,,  to understand how marker pen can add
MdLMLMzudbM3,0.39,0.53,  information to our sketch we need to
MdLMLMzudbM3,,,  think about light and in particular
MdLMLMzudbM3,,,  where the light is coming from I 'm using
MdLMLMzudbM3,,,  a reasonably light tone to color the top
MdLMLMzudbM3,,,  surface of this box you 'll notice that
MdLMLMzudbM3,,,  I 'm working quickly and tidying up the
MdLMLMzudbM4,0.54,1.08,  edge whilst the ink is still wet
MdLMLMzudbM4,,,  I 'm doing the same with the medium tone
MdLMLMzudbM4,,,  on the right hand surface suggesting
MdLMLMzudbM4,,,  that it 's further or more hidden from
MdLMLMzudbM4,,,  the light source than the top surface
MdLMLMzudbM4,,,  finally the darker tone on the remaining
MdLMLMzudbM5,1.11,1.23,  surface show it still further from the
MdLMLMzudbM5,,,  light this add to the three
MdLMLMzudbM5,,,  appearance of the box
MdLMLMzudbM5,,,  it also suggests that the light source
MdLMLMzudbM5,,,  is somewhere above and to the right of
MdLMLMzudbM5,,,  the box this exercise is good for
MdLMLMzudbM6,1.27,1.5,  practicing working within the sketched
MdLMLMzudbM6,,,  line but again I 'm developing this
MdLMLMzudbM6,,,  skill a a mean of communication rather
MdLMLMzudbM6,,,  than presentation
MdLMLMzudbM6,,,  the box that sits on the horizon ha
MdLMLMzudbM6,,,  only two face visible and therefore
MdLMLMzudbM7,1.53,2.06,  only two tone
MdLMLMzudbM7,,,  you can see that the position of the
MdLMLMzudbM7,,,  light source is the same for each of the
MdLMLMzudbM7,,,  box so the box have a relationship
MdLMLMzudbM7,,,  to each other within the space we 're
MdLMLMzudbM7,,,  looking up at the box above the
MdLMLMzudbM8,2.07,3.06,  horizon so we can see two side and a
MdLMLMzudbM8,,,  base on each the base of these will be
MdLMLMzudbM8,,,  an even darker taupe since they 're most
MdLMLMzudbM8,,,  hidden from the light source
MdLMLMzudbM8,,,  is worth practicing the process until it
MdLMLMzudbM8,,,  becomes second nature and we 're working
MdLMLMzudbM9,3.08,3.25,  on the ability to sketch it with pencil
MdLMLMzudbM9,,,  biro pen or marker pen in a relaxed
MdLMLMzudbM9,,,  manner that 's economic a good time
MdLMLMzudbM9,,,  if we 're preoccupied with perfecting our
MdLMLMzudbM9,,,  presentation then are sketching will
MdLMLMzudbM9,,,  become slow our source of idea will
MdLMLMzudbM10,3.28,3.39,  quickly dry up
MdLMLMzudbM10,,,  we choose to add markup and to our
MdLMLMzudbM10,,,  sketch is normally to help communicate
MdLMLMzudbM10,,,  our thought and make the design
MdLMLMzudbM10,,,  feature of our idea easier to
MdLMLMzudbM10,,,  understand for the person reading on
MdLMLMzudbM11,3.4,4.07,  page
MdLMLMzudbM11,,,  moving on it 's worth working with
MdLMLMzudbM11,,,  slightly more involved shape here are a
MdLMLMzudbM11,,,  collection of hollow box facing in a
MdLMLMzudbM11,,,  variety of direction
MdLMLMzudbM11,,,  again I 'm working quickly attempting to
MdLMLMzudbM12,4.1,4.28,  work up to the edge of shape without
MdLMLMzudbM12,,,  going over them but not worrying and
MdLMLMzudbM12,,,  Julie if I do
MdLMLMzudbM12,,,  trying to fill the whole surface without
MdLMLMzudbM12,,,  letting the ink dry hand where it dry
MdLMLMzudbM12,,,  and I go over it it becomes a darker
MdLMLMzudbM13,4.3,4.5,  tape
MdLMLMzudbM13,,,  it can be a good idea to produce a page
MdLMLMzudbM13,,,  of shape in two point perspective and
MdLMLMzudbM13,,,  to photocopy it several time for
MdLMLMzudbM13,,,  practicing with marker pen that would
MdLMLMzudbM13,,,  develop more Skills to quickly reduce a
MdLMLMzudbM14,4.52,5.11,  new page of shape into point
MdLMLMzudbM14,,,  perspective each time here I 'm using
MdLMLMzudbM14,,,  darker tone to add shadow to the inside
MdLMLMzudbM14,,,  of the box this enables the person
MdLMLMzudbM14,,,  who 's reading the page to fully
MdLMLMzudbM14,,,  understand the shape more quickly
MdLMLMzudbM15,5.15,5.36,  practicing this process here will make
MdLMLMzudbM15,,,  it easier when rendering more complex
MdLMLMzudbM15,,,  design idea and the placing of the
MdLMLMzudbM15,,,  shadow is informed by the position of
MdLMLMzudbM15,,,  the light source
MdLMLMzudbM15,,,  exactly the same process is used for
MdLMLMzudbM16,5.38,5.52,  representing curved surface here I 'm
MdLMLMzudbM16,,,  using different tone to give the sense
MdLMLMzudbM16,,,  of a cylindrical surface
MdLMLMzudbM16,,,  the lightest tone is positioned where
MdLMLMzudbM16,,,  the shape is hit by the most light and
MdLMLMzudbM16,,,  the darkest tone where the surface is
MdLMLMzudbM17,5.55,6.2,  least exposed to the light
MdLMLMzudbM17,,,  anybody reading the sketch would have
MdLMLMzudbM17,,,  no idea if these were cylinder or tube
MdLMLMzudbM17,,,  without the addition of this marker pen
MdLMLMzudbM17,,,  which clearly represents them a hollow
MdLMLMzudbM17,,,  to reiterate I 'm working quickly here
MdLMLMzudbM18,6.23,6.44,  because this is a sketch to convey my
MdLMLMzudbM18,,,  thought and idea rather than being a
MdLMLMzudbM18,,,  polished and finished presentation
MdLMLMzudbM18,,,  drawing
MdLMLMzudbM18,,,  since these curved shape are like flat
MdLMLMzudbM18,,,  on the surface I 'm seating them on the
MdLMLMzudbM19,6.46,7.07,  page by creating shadow I 'm using the
MdLMLMzudbM19,,,  same position of the light source that
MdLMLMzudbM19,,,  give me the different tone on the
MdLMLMzudbM19,,,  curved surface to position them
MdLMLMzudbM19,,,  I hope this ha been a useful video
MdLMLMzudbM19,,,  please hit like if it ha there 's lot
MdLMLMzudbM21,7.1,7.3,  more on the way so please subscribe and
MdLMLMzudbM21,,,  hit the notification tab to be the
MdLMLMzudbM21,,,  first to see it for up report
MdLMLMzudbM21,,,  on progress and to see my other pursuit
MdLMLMzudbM21,,,  you can follow me on instagram the
MdLMLMzudbM21,,,  product designer maker thanks for
MdLMLMzudbM21,,,  watching
MdLMLMzudbM21,,,  you
KBXOzq0OpS01,0,0.17,  okay start with a blank presentation
KBXOzq0OpS01,,,  that 's going to open up and give you
KBXOzq0OpS01,,,  this automatic setup you do n't want this
KBXOzq0OpS01,,,  so click on each of these box and
KBXOzq0OpS01,,,  delete them you want to start from
KBXOzq0OpS01,,,  scratch next up insert
KBXOzq0OpS02,0.22,0.4,  your video okay so you 've already
KBXOzq0OpS02,,,  recorded your video you 're going to go
KBXOzq0OpS02,,,  and get your video from your computer
KBXOzq0OpS02,,,  here 's mine I 'm going to insert it you
KBXOzq0OpS02,,,  can put it anywhere you want most people
KBXOzq0OpS02,,,  read from left to right so it 's best to
KBXOzq0OpS03,0.42,0.54,  put it on the left and then you can make
KBXOzq0OpS03,,,  it a big a you want realize that the
KBXOzq0OpS03,,,  bigger you make thing the more of the
KBXOzq0OpS03,,,  bigger the file is going to be and you
KBXOzq0OpS03,,,  want to have a file that you can handle
KBXOzq0OpS03,,,  please notice that this video ha it
KBXOzq0OpS04,0.57,1.09,  control down here and a timer but these
KBXOzq0OpS04,,,  thing you do n't really need to deal
KBXOzq0OpS04,,,  with because all you 're going to do is
KBXOzq0OpS04,,,  the simplest right now so after you
KBXOzq0OpS04,,,  place your video what you want to do is
KBXOzq0OpS04,,,  to tell the computer how to handle it so
KBXOzq0OpS05,1.12,1.27,  we 're going to go juice the video up
KBXOzq0OpS05,,,  here to play back and then choose that
KBXOzq0OpS05,,,  it should play back automatically that 's
KBXOzq0OpS05,,,  really really important because what
KBXOzq0OpS05,,,  that mean is that when you go down here
KBXOzq0OpS05,,,  can you click on slide show it start
KBXOzq0OpS06,1.3,1.43,  automatically all right okay so we get
KBXOzq0OpS06,,,  out of the slide show the next thing we
KBXOzq0OpS06,,,  want to do is to put our visuals up here
KBXOzq0OpS06,,,  we 'll put them on the right hand side of
KBXOzq0OpS06,,,  the screen and so what we want to do
KBXOzq0OpS06,,,  again is to insert anything you want but
KBXOzq0OpS07,1.48,2.02,  I 'm going to just go with simple
KBXOzq0OpS07,,,  picture that I 've already saved so I 'm
KBXOzq0OpS07,,,  going to choose just part 1 i 'm going to
KBXOzq0OpS07,,,  insert it i 'm going to move it around to
KBXOzq0OpS07,,,  where I want it to be and then I 'm going
KBXOzq0OpS07,,,  to tell it how to come in with this
KBXOzq0OpS08,2.04,2.21,  video I go up to animation I go over
KBXOzq0OpS08,,,  here I mean I choose how it appears
KBXOzq0OpS08,,,  that 's how I wanted to appear then I
KBXOzq0OpS08,,,  need to go over here
KBXOzq0OpS08,,,  and choose how it 's going to exit it
KBXOzq0OpS08,,,  going to just disappear all right notice
KBXOzq0OpS09,2.25,2.38,  that we 've got number going on here 0
KBXOzq0OpS09,,,  because this start at zero and then
KBXOzq0OpS09,,,  first it appears and then did n't then it
KBXOzq0OpS09,,,  disappears okay notice i always have up
KBXOzq0OpS09,,,  here on click when it come to these
KBXOzq0OpS09,,,  element everything must be on click
KBXOzq0OpS010,2.41,2.57,  because that will allow you to choose a
KBXOzq0OpS010,,,  this video with playing when this come
KBXOzq0OpS010,,,  in and when this come out so let 's try
KBXOzq0OpS010,,,  it if i go ahead and hear it start and i
KBXOzq0OpS010,,,  click again it come in and i click
KBXOzq0OpS010,,,  again and it disappears you do that with
KBXOzq0OpS011,3.01,3.16,  every visual you put in so let me show
KBXOzq0OpS011,,,  you i 'll insert another visual I 'll take
KBXOzq0OpS011,,,  a picture
KBXOzq0OpS011,,,  and
KBXOzq0OpS011,,,  and insert it and I will sort it out
KBXOzq0OpS011,,,  right notice I 'm putting it right on top
KBXOzq0OpS012,3.18,3.34,  of the other one that 's fine because the
KBXOzq0OpS012,,,  other one will have disappeared then I
KBXOzq0OpS012,,,  go up to animation and I choose how
KBXOzq0OpS012,,,  it 's going to up here and then I choose
KBXOzq0OpS012,,,  how it 's going to disappear and I make
KBXOzq0OpS012,,,  sure that everything is on click I never
KBXOzq0OpS013,3.36,3.58,  change this ok and I 'll do one more I 'm
KBXOzq0OpS013,,,  going to go up here insert the picture
KBXOzq0OpS013,,,  move it to where I want it to go and
KBXOzq0OpS013,,,  then choose the animation I 'm going to
KBXOzq0OpS013,,,  make it just appear i 'm also going to
KBXOzq0OpS013,,,  add so that i can make it disappear
KBXOzq0OpS014,4.02,4.16,  everything is going to be on click if i
KBXOzq0OpS014,,,  can move I can move these around a
KBXOzq0OpS014,,,  little bit so you can see the order all
KBXOzq0OpS014,,,  right now this is the simplest simplest
KBXOzq0OpS014,,,  way to do it look there 's lot of other
KBXOzq0OpS014,,,  way you can do it but I 'm showing you
KBXOzq0OpS015,4.18,4.34,  just a very simplest so I split these up
KBXOzq0OpS015,,,  a little bit so you can see 0 1 2 3 4 5
KBXOzq0OpS015,,,  6 this is when it enters this is what an
KBXOzq0OpS015,,,  exit this is when it enters this is when
KBXOzq0OpS015,,,  it exit and so on ok so let 's see how
KBXOzq0OpS015,,,  that work again I start the slideshow
KBXOzq0OpS016,4.38,4.55,  he start to be king automatically I
KBXOzq0OpS016,,,  click and I get the first one to come up
KBXOzq0OpS016,,,  I click again and it disappears I click
KBXOzq0OpS016,,,  on the second one come up
KBXOzq0OpS016,,,  disappears I click the third one and it
KBXOzq0OpS016,,,  come up I click again and it disappears
KBXOzq0OpS018,4.58,5.23,  okay that 's the simple way to do it
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  realize that if you just got one you
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  just want to have one visual to the
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  right of the speaker you just put these
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  right on top of each other all right it
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  doe n't matter whether you can see them
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  in the right order or not the computer
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  know what the order is you can get more
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  laughter from here but this is the basic
KBXOzq0OpS018,,,  way to do this good luck
i2of4_ZnqS81,0.05,0.21,  Hello I 'm Callie .
i2of4_ZnqS81,,,  What 's the fastest way to tell the difference between a speech and a presentation ?
i2of4_ZnqS81,,,  It 's audio .
i2of4_ZnqS81,,,  Today we 'll talk about the importance of visual aid .
i2of4_ZnqS81,,,  Thanks for visiting Toastmasters International .
i2of4_ZnqS81,,,  Since 1924 we 've helped more than 4 million people gain the confidence to communicate
i2of4_ZnqS82,0.27,0.5,  in all circumstance .
i2of4_ZnqS82,,,  One of the most demanding situation you 'll ever face is speaking to an audience .
i2of4_ZnqS82,,,  This video is part of a series of Toastmasters ' time tip that will help you become
i2of4_ZnqS82,,,  a more confident speaker .
i2of4_ZnqS82,,,  In this video we 'll explore simple and effective way to make the most of visual aid .
i2of4_ZnqS82,,,  Let 's begin with a few simple way to add flare to your next speech by incorporating
i2of4_ZnqS83,0.56,1.21,  visual aid .
i2of4_ZnqS83,,,  When presenting for business the most commonly tool are a computer and projector and with
i2of4_ZnqS83,,,  the help of presentation software image can be projected in sequence on a large screen
i2of4_ZnqS83,,,  that even people in the back of the room can easily see .
i2of4_ZnqS83,,,  Additionally presentation software make it easier for you to include a short video ;
i2of4_ZnqS83,,,  however keep in mind that when you play a video that ha audio you 'll need to have a
i2of4_ZnqS84,1.26,1.45,  pair of external speaker .
i2of4_ZnqS84,,,  Most built laptop speaker lack the power needed to increase volume so everyone in the
i2of4_ZnqS84,,,  room can hear .
i2of4_ZnqS84,,,  Another important tool is the remote control .
i2of4_ZnqS84,,,  This wireless handheld device allows you to advance your presentation without having to
i2of4_ZnqS84,,,  step over the laptop every time you want to advance to the next slide or picture .
i2of4_ZnqS85,1.51,2.08,  Projecting an image on the screen can help the audience visually grasp your point and
i2of4_ZnqS85,,,  a prop can add an extra dimension to your presentation .
i2of4_ZnqS85,,,  Visual aid are a great way to keep the audience interested .
i2of4_ZnqS85,,,  When you want to brainstorm with the audience get back to basic by incorporating a flip
i2of4_ZnqS85,,,  chart or white board .
i2of4_ZnqS85,,,  For this type of exercise there is no better tool .
i2of4_ZnqS86,2.12,2.33,  On the spot you can grab your listener idea and jot them down .
i2of4_ZnqS86,,,  The rapid exchange is fun and the audience feel more invested in the experience by seeing
i2of4_ZnqS86,,,  their word and idea come to life before them .
i2of4_ZnqS86,,,  Now that we 've identified the key support tool let 's take a look at we can effectively
i2of4_ZnqS86,,,  interact with visual aid .
i2of4_ZnqS86,,,  If you plan to present with a slide deck you have to prepare for Murphy 's Law .
i2of4_ZnqS87,2.38,2.58,  `` Who is Murphy and what 's his law ? '' you ask .
i2of4_ZnqS87,,,  It 's the idea that if anything can go wrong it will .
i2of4_ZnqS87,,,  In preparation be ready for technical glitch by printing up a backup copy of your presentation
i2of4_ZnqS87,,,  slide .
i2of4_ZnqS87,,,  No matter what happens to the audio or video equipment you 'll be fully prepared to stand
i2of4_ZnqS87,,,  and deliver because you have your printed slide and talking point with you .
i2of4_ZnqS88,3.04,3.24,  When it come to setting up your visual aid arrive early to the venue to position your
i2of4_ZnqS88,,,  material in the best location .
i2of4_ZnqS88,,,  If you 're working with a computer test it to be sure you can see your presentation deck
i2of4_ZnqS88,,,  on the screen .
i2of4_ZnqS88,,,  Honoring Murphy 's Law always carry a backup copy of your slide deck on a USB drive to
i2of4_ZnqS88,,,  remedy possible technical problem that may arise .
i2of4_ZnqS89,3.29,3.5,  Be aware that presenting with visual aid can be troublesome .
i2of4_ZnqS89,,,  For instance telling a story about a bear when you have a picture of a rowboat on the
i2of4_ZnqS89,,,  screen can confuse the audience .
i2of4_ZnqS89,,,  Always remember that the image on the screen must relate to the story you 're sharing in
i2of4_ZnqS89,,,  order for your story and you to have credibility .
i2of4_ZnqS89,,,  Similarly do n't feel tempted to use video just because it 's an option .
i2of4_ZnqS810,3.56,4.17,  A frivolous video that doe n't support your message is a distraction .
i2of4_ZnqS810,,,  So choose video that will reinforce your point .
i2of4_ZnqS810,,,  While slide can help you stay on track they also create another challenge they increase
i2of4_ZnqS810,,,  the number of spoken transition in your presentation .
i2of4_ZnqS810,,,  Every time you click on the next slide you 'll need to verbally take the audience from one
i2of4_ZnqS810,,,  slide idea to the next to make the story feel seamless and fluid .
i2of4_ZnqS811,4.23,4.48,  And last but not least it 's time to concentrate on the final consideration : the you factor .
i2of4_ZnqS811,,,  The most prominent visual aid in the front of the room is you .
i2of4_ZnqS811,,,  And that 's why it 's crucial that you pay close attention to your personal style .
i2of4_ZnqS811,,,  Are the clothes you are wearing in line with your message ?
i2of4_ZnqS811,,,  If you 're ever in doubt with how to dress follow this simple rule : raise your style
i2of4_ZnqS811,,,  one level higher than the audience 's .
i2of4_ZnqS813,4.51,5.27,  For instance if they 're dressed casually then dress in line with business casual style .
i2of4_ZnqS813,,,  The way we move physically also play a part in our visual credibility .
i2of4_ZnqS813,,,  Avoid moving too much or too little because both can be distracting .
i2of4_ZnqS813,,,  Pay special attention that your gesture and movement support your story .
i2of4_ZnqS813,,,  Incorporate these tip and technique and before you know it you 'll have mastered the

4pymfPHQ6SA1,0.04,0.17,  what if I told you that the world
4pymfPHQ6SA1,,,  creates 2.5 quintillion byte of data
4pymfPHQ6SA1,,,  every single day would you believe me
4pymfPHQ6SA1,,,  what if I told you that 90 % of all data
4pymfPHQ6SA1,,,  ever created in the history of the world
4pymfPHQ6SA1,,,  sprouted in just the past two year do
4pymfPHQ6SA2,0.2,0.31,  you believe me yet well hold on your
4pymfPHQ6SA2,,,  brain folk because both are very very
4pymfPHQ6SA2,,,  true whether it 's the 13 new spotify
4pymfPHQ6SA2,,,  song or the 600 Wikipedia page edits
4pymfPHQ6SA2,,,  maybe the five hundred and twenty seven
4pymfPHQ6SA2,,,  thousand snapchats or how about sixty
4pymfPHQ6SA3,0.34,0.45,  million text all of this data is
4pymfPHQ6SA3,,,  created no not just in a day in 60
4pymfPHQ6SA3,,,  second which is why we want to let the
4pymfPHQ6SA3,,,  data scientist decipher this
4pymfPHQ6SA3,,,  never feed of information but it
4pymfPHQ6SA3,,,  is important for all of u to know how
4pymfPHQ6SA4,0.47,0.55,  to present this information in a
4pymfPHQ6SA4,,,  visually appealing way that 's why I 'm
4pymfPHQ6SA4,,,  here
4pymfPHQ6SA4,,,  hello world my name is Mike plugger here
4pymfPHQ6SA4,,,  with viz me and I 'm here to show you how
4pymfPHQ6SA4,,,  you can create data that appeal to your
4pymfPHQ6SA5,0.57,1.09,  viewer but also how to create data that
4pymfPHQ6SA5,,,  tell a story let 's get started before
4pymfPHQ6SA5,,,  we begin if you 're interested in how our
4pymfPHQ6SA5,,,  brain decipher all of this information
4pymfPHQ6SA5,,,  check out this video by visibly falender
4pymfPHQ6SA5,,,  payment ie about the science behind how
4pymfPHQ6SA6,1.11,1.25,  we perceive object believe it or not
4pymfPHQ6SA6,,,  our vision is much more complicated than
4pymfPHQ6SA6,,,  you may have ever thought but payment
4pymfPHQ6SA6,,,  simplifies it with a handful of helpful
4pymfPHQ6SA6,,,  visuals
4pymfPHQ6SA6,,,  when it come to a specific image there
4pymfPHQ6SA7,1.28,1.39,  are two thing that our brain
4pymfPHQ6SA7,,,  immediately notice contrast and pattern
4pymfPHQ6SA7,,,  take a look at our very first image at
4pymfPHQ6SA7,,,  first glance you can only decipher a
4pymfPHQ6SA7,,,  tree landscape that 's because there is
4pymfPHQ6SA7,,,  absolutely no contrast in this all
4pymfPHQ6SA8,1.42,1.54,  image but a you start to add in more
4pymfPHQ6SA8,,,  contrast with purple and yellow you may
4pymfPHQ6SA8,,,  notice that now there 's a bear that wa
4pymfPHQ6SA8,,,  there that you could n't see before but
4pymfPHQ6SA8,,,  it 's hard to have any more contrast than
4pymfPHQ6SA8,,,  with black and white and this final
4pymfPHQ6SA9,1.56,2.11,  image that bear popping off of the page
4pymfPHQ6SA9,,,  this just go to show that our brain
4pymfPHQ6SA9,,,  are better at identifying color rather
4pymfPHQ6SA9,,,  than shape through what is called
4pymfPHQ6SA9,,,  pre processing our brain are
4pymfPHQ6SA9,,,  constantly gathering information from
4pymfPHQ6SA10,2.13,2.24,  our environment because of this it 's
4pymfPHQ6SA10,,,  easier to detect the difference around
4pymfPHQ6SA10,,,  u that is especially noticeable in
4pymfPHQ6SA10,,,  pattern we just talked about contrast
4pymfPHQ6SA10,,,  so in this very first pattern our brain
4pymfPHQ6SA10,,,  immediately notice that darker rectangle
4pymfPHQ6SA11,2.27,2.37,  in the lower left if you take away the
4pymfPHQ6SA11,,,  contrast when you make one rectangle
4pymfPHQ6SA11,,,  with just a little bit larger it still
4pymfPHQ6SA11,,,  stand out immediately
4pymfPHQ6SA11,,,  lastly you take that one rectangle that
4pymfPHQ6SA11,,,  wa a little bit larger and even flip it
4pymfPHQ6SA12,2.39,2.54,  vertically it still stand out among the
4pymfPHQ6SA12,,,  rest of it rectangle friend this is
4pymfPHQ6SA12,,,  our brain working for u
4pymfPHQ6SA12,,,  now that we 've established how our
4pymfPHQ6SA12,,,  brain see image let 's dive into
4pymfPHQ6SA12,,,  applying this knowledge with creating
4pymfPHQ6SA13,2.55,3.1,  some effective data visualization first
4pymfPHQ6SA13,,,  different from reading text our eye
4pymfPHQ6SA13,,,  do n't follow a specific order and
4pymfPHQ6SA13,,,  reading a chart or a graph our eye
4pymfPHQ6SA13,,,  do n't go from left to right or from up
4pymfPHQ6SA13,,,  to down when reading a graph or a chart
4pymfPHQ6SA14,3.12,3.23,  a you can see here our eye kind of go
4pymfPHQ6SA14,,,  really
4pymfPHQ6SA14,,,  wherever the pace when looking at a
4pymfPHQ6SA14,,,  graph our chart is also very different
4pymfPHQ6SA14,,,  we may just glance at one part of the
4pymfPHQ6SA14,,,  image while glaring at another this is
4pymfPHQ6SA15,3.25,3.38,  why it 's so difficult to create a
4pymfPHQ6SA15,,,  graphic that take u on a predefined
4pymfPHQ6SA15,,,  visual journey when we look at a graph
4pymfPHQ6SA15,,,  our eye are immediately directed to
4pymfPHQ6SA15,,,  what stand out it all go back to the
4pymfPHQ6SA15,,,  pattern that we had just discussed but
4pymfPHQ6SA16,3.4,3.51,  there should just be one main focal
4pymfPHQ6SA16,,,  point to your image in this graph our
4pymfPHQ6SA16,,,  eye are immediately directed to that
4pymfPHQ6SA16,,,  steep climb and peak on the right side
4pymfPHQ6SA16,,,  of the graph and after we see the title
4pymfPHQ6SA16,,,  we immediately understand that the u.s .
4pymfPHQ6SA17,3.54,4.09,  incarceration rate ha jumped greatly
4pymfPHQ6SA17,,,  beginning in the 1970s the best data
4pymfPHQ6SA17,,,  storyteller will only have one clear
4pymfPHQ6SA17,,,  message that is effortlessly understood
4pymfPHQ6SA17,,,  this graph here did a great job of that
4pymfPHQ6SA17,,,  when there are more than five variable
4pymfPHQ6SA18,4.11,4.23,  present our eye perceive all of them a
4pymfPHQ6SA18,,,  one single hole this is another reason
4pymfPHQ6SA18,,,  to simplify your chart and only
4pymfPHQ6SA18,,,  highlight one single point this graph
4pymfPHQ6SA18,,,  here is an example of what not to do you
4pymfPHQ6SA18,,,  notice the word outage the gray
4pymfPHQ6SA19,4.25,4.36,  background spike and even at that Green
4pymfPHQ6SA19,,,  Line going throughout the graph but
4pymfPHQ6SA19,,,  what 's the message a lot of unnecessary
4pymfPHQ6SA19,,,  time and effort is spent in to
4pymfPHQ6SA19,,,  deciphering what this chart is telling
4pymfPHQ6SA19,,,  me after some time you can probably
4pymfPHQ6SA20,4.38,4.49,  figure it out but it would be much more
4pymfPHQ6SA20,,,  effective if you got rid of that gray
4pymfPHQ6SA20,,,  background area and told u the call
4pymfPHQ6SA20,,,  received and simply focused on the
4pymfPHQ6SA20,,,  rating before and after the outage
4pymfPHQ6SA21,4.52,5.03,  remember and I will continue to
4pymfPHQ6SA21,,,  emphasize this our brain recognize
4pymfPHQ6SA21,,,  pattern and in pattern we find
4pymfPHQ6SA21,,,  connection here the brain assumes the
4pymfPHQ6SA21,,,  connection between the color orange and
4pymfPHQ6SA21,,,  top performer and also the orange data
4pymfPHQ6SA22,5.05,5.15,  point
4pymfPHQ6SA22,,,  this need u to think that the orange
4pymfPHQ6SA22,,,  data point are the top performer but
4pymfPHQ6SA22,,,  that 's not the case this is another
4pymfPHQ6SA22,,,  poorly executed chart the top performer
4pymfPHQ6SA22,,,  are actually all those data point in
4pymfPHQ6SA23,5.17,5.32,  the top right which if you look at it
4pymfPHQ6SA23,,,  seems to be mostly the blue data point
4pymfPHQ6SA23,,,  if you 're using more than one color you
4pymfPHQ6SA23,,,  want to assign deliberately which did n't
4pymfPHQ6SA23,,,  happen here from the time we 're born
4pymfPHQ6SA23,,,  we 're influenced by cultural convention
4pymfPHQ6SA24,5.34,5.45,  what are these exactly well for example
4pymfPHQ6SA24,,,  time is right on a line from left to
4pymfPHQ6SA24,,,  right or with color red mean hot and
4pymfPHQ6SA24,,,  blue mean cold the same can even be
4pymfPHQ6SA24,,,  said with image a scale and FERS
4pymfPHQ6SA24,,,  balance or comparison between two
4pymfPHQ6SA25,5.47,5.56,  different thing
4pymfPHQ6SA25,,,  if these convention are ignored our
4pymfPHQ6SA25,,,  visuals will become much more difficult
4pymfPHQ6SA25,,,  to understand this chart is nearly
4pymfPHQ6SA25,,,  identical to the one that we found back
4pymfPHQ6SA25,,,  in tip 3 but time is placed on the
4pymfPHQ6SA26,5.59,6.17,  y say time is read on a line from
4pymfPHQ6SA26,,,  left to right a we just said this is
4pymfPHQ6SA26,,,  much more confusing and much le
4pymfPHQ6SA26,,,  effective keep time on the x trust
4pymfPHQ6SA26,,,  me
4pymfPHQ6SA26,,,  now this video is n't just about
4pymfPHQ6SA27,6.19,6.29,  improving your chart the whole reason
4pymfPHQ6SA27,,,  we 're here is to help your chart tell a
4pymfPHQ6SA27,,,  story so let 's show you some
4pymfPHQ6SA27,,,  before example to help you
4pymfPHQ6SA27,,,  create some fresh idea on how to create
4pymfPHQ6SA27,,,  that next effective storytelling chart
4pymfPHQ6SA28,6.32,6.42,  if you want to look at the number of
4pymfPHQ6SA28,,,  ticket received versus the number of
4pymfPHQ6SA28,,,  ticket processed in a year this chart
4pymfPHQ6SA28,,,  is n't too difficult to read but is it
4pymfPHQ6SA28,,,  telling the story for the reason of
4pymfPHQ6SA28,,,  decline no no it 's not it come the
4pymfPHQ6SA29,6.45,6.57,  after chart where you can clearly see
4pymfPHQ6SA29,,,  the decline in ticket processed there 's
4pymfPHQ6SA29,,,  also a lot more room for text which will
4pymfPHQ6SA29,,,  help explain the story to employee quit
4pymfPHQ6SA29,,,  that 's your reason for decline so if I 'm
4pymfPHQ6SA29,,,  the bos this is a very very easy
4pymfPHQ6SA30,6.59,7.14,  decision hire two more employee pronto
4pymfPHQ6SA30,,,  in our next example we have a lot of
4pymfPHQ6SA30,,,  room for text but pie chart are n't
4pymfPHQ6SA30,,,  always the best solution especially for
4pymfPHQ6SA30,,,  the data that we have here the use of
4pymfPHQ6SA30,,,  one single bar chart make the info a
4pymfPHQ6SA31,7.16,7.3,  lot more clear more child were
4pymfPHQ6SA31,,,  interested in science
4pymfPHQ6SA31,,,  after the program or before they thought
4pymfPHQ6SA31,,,  science wa just okay once again we have
4pymfPHQ6SA31,,,  an ineffective and confusing sharp it 's
4pymfPHQ6SA31,,,  not clarifying the change in average
4pymfPHQ6SA32,7.32,7.43,  price per product over time the reader
4pymfPHQ6SA32,,,  is forced to go back and forth from the
4pymfPHQ6SA32,,,  legend to the bar the legend to the
4pymfPHQ6SA32,,,  bar but in the second chart the line
4pymfPHQ6SA32,,,  are labeled properly so there is no back
4pymfPHQ6SA32,,,  and forth you can see that the trend for
4pymfPHQ6SA33,7.45,7.58,  each product is recognizable at the very
4pymfPHQ6SA33,,,  first glance in any case that you want
4pymfPHQ6SA33,,,  to show the change over time a line
4pymfPHQ6SA33,,,  graph is probably your best option I
4pymfPHQ6SA33,,,  like to think of it a time line maybe
4pymfPHQ6SA33,,,  that 's just me
4pymfPHQ6SA34,7.59,8.13,  but maybe it could also help you to
4pymfPHQ6SA34,,,  last but not least our final before
4pymfPHQ6SA34,,,  chart seems pretty easy to read however
4pymfPHQ6SA34,,,  the convention that we 've learned and
4pymfPHQ6SA34,,,  discussed earlier are not applied
4pymfPHQ6SA34,,,  properly the level of interest is n't
4pymfPHQ6SA35,8.15,8.25,  organized in the sending order we 're
4pymfPHQ6SA35,,,  here in the second chart the reader
4pymfPHQ6SA35,,,  understands who 's the most interested
4pymfPHQ6SA35,,,  versus who 's the least interested in
4pymfPHQ6SA35,,,  that correct order through color and
4pymfPHQ6SA35,,,  order via a scale the difference in
4pymfPHQ6SA36,8.28,8.38,  value are more distinguishable now that
4pymfPHQ6SA36,,,  you 've learned the principle for a
4pymfPHQ6SA36,,,  persuasive data storytelling create your
4pymfPHQ6SA36,,,  next chart on viz meas website there 's a
4pymfPHQ6SA36,,,  chart an infographic tool that is
4pymfPHQ6SA36,,,  completely free and there 's a wide
4pymfPHQ6SA38,8.39,8.54,  variety of other visual communication
4pymfPHQ6SA38,,,  tool at your disposal also make sure

4pymfPHQ6SA38,,,  you
S3tuT0yimfM1,0.05,0.2,  Designing effective visual aid : so you need to make some visual aid to
S3tuT0yimfM1,,,  enhance your presentation
S3tuT0yimfM1,,,  after you have planned your content it 's time to think about how you will present
S3tuT0yimfM1,,,  it
S3tuT0yimfM1,,,  first decide which software to use
S3tuT0yimfM1,,,  most student use PowerPoint but there are other option such a prezi
S3tuT0yimfM2,0.25,0.4,  and you can consider that
S3tuT0yimfM2,,,  this video us PowerPoint but the same idea can be used in prezis or other
S3tuT0yimfM2,,,  type of software
S3tuT0yimfM2,,,  OK when it come to designing your PowerPoint
S3tuT0yimfM2,,,  there are some main point to keep in mind
S3tuT0yimfM2,,,  you should start with choosing a background and font
S3tuT0yimfM3,0.43,0.56,  it 's better to avoid using bright colour a they can not only be distracting but
S3tuT0yimfM3,,,  also difficult to see from a distance
S3tuT0yimfM3,,,  instead
S3tuT0yimfM3,,,  choose a light background with dark simple font
S3tuT0yimfM3,,,  or a dark background
S3tuT0yimfM3,,,  with a light font
S3tuT0yimfM4,1,1.16,  you should use a minimum of at least size 28 font
S3tuT0yimfM4,,,  remember that the person in the back of the room ha to be able to see the text
S3tuT0yimfM4,,,  a well
S3tuT0yimfM4,,,  also in a group presentation
S3tuT0yimfM4,,,  you should have a consistent design for all slide
S3tuT0yimfM4,,,  the next thing to consider is the text itself
S3tuT0yimfM5,1.19,1.36,  do n't overload the slide with too many detail
S3tuT0yimfM5,,,  writing lot of information in a PowerPoint presentation can be
S3tuT0yimfM5,,,  distracting and frustrating for the audience
S3tuT0yimfM5,,,  within second of your presentation starting you are likely to lose the
S3tuT0yimfM5,,,  audience 's attention
S3tuT0yimfM5,,,  they wo n't be listening to you
S3tuT0yimfM6,1.38,1.52,  they 'll be trying to read all the information on the slide
S3tuT0yimfM6,,,  keep in mind
S3tuT0yimfM6,,,  the PowerPoint should only guide your speaking not replace it
S3tuT0yimfM6,,,  instead
S3tuT0yimfM6,,,  choose only key point to highlight your information
S3tuT0yimfM6,,,  you should not write in full sentence or paragraph
S3tuT0yimfM7,1.55,2.11,  instead
S3tuT0yimfM7,,,  choose key point and write them in bullet point
S3tuT0yimfM7,,,  three to five bullet point on each slide will do
S3tuT0yimfM7,,,  use noun phrase and parallel structure
S3tuT0yimfM7,,,  this make your point far more effective
S3tuT0yimfM7,,,  PowerPoints are more interesting to your audience if you include image such
S3tuT0yimfM8,2.14,2.33,  a picture chart and graph
S3tuT0yimfM8,,,  but do n't overdo it
S3tuT0yimfM8,,,  use chart and graph to illustrate data and fact
S3tuT0yimfM8,,,  people are more likely to remember and understand the information in that form
S3tuT0yimfM8,,,  rather than listing number in a table
S3tuT0yimfM8,,,  picture are always effective and can help explain complex concept but use
S3tuT0yimfM9,2.37,2.49,  them sparingly
S3tuT0yimfM9,,,  choose appropriate picture and remember that you need to have permission to use
S3tuT0yimfM9,,,  them
S3tuT0yimfM9,,,  all picture
S3tuT0yimfM9,,,  should show the source
S3tuT0yimfM9,,,  another thing to consider when creating a PowerPoint
S3tuT0yimfM10,2.52,3.09,  is limiting the use of special effect and graphic a they can be quite
S3tuT0yimfM10,,,  distracting
S3tuT0yimfM10,,,  the audience is there to hear what you have to say
S3tuT0yimfM10,,,  not to look at your PowerPoint slide
S3tuT0yimfM10,,,  remember in academic presentation you need to provide in reference on
S3tuT0yimfM10,,,  slide
S3tuT0yimfM12,3.09,3.4,  when you 're citing other source
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  and then you need to provide a reference list on your final slide
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  use the right referencing system for your subject
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  APA
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  or IEEE for example
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  you can even create a QR code at the end of your presentation
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  a a way to distribute your reference list to the audience
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  finally
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  make sure that your language is correct
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  proofread the slide for any overlooked spelling and grammatical error
S3tuT0yimfM12,,,  all right that 's it from me start designing your visual aid
RJCp-ttFpd41,0,0.16,  one way to make your presentation more
RJCp-ttFpd41,,,  impactful is to use some key idea and
RJCp-ttFpd41,,,  principle from the realm of graphic
RJCp-ttFpd41,,,  design first let 's start with a typical
RJCp-ttFpd41,,,  slide what do you think and perhaps more
RJCp-ttFpd41,,,  importantly what will your audience take
RJCp-ttFpd42,0.19,0.32,  yes that 's probably a pretty common form
RJCp-ttFpd42,,,  but not specifically what 's wrong with
RJCp-ttFpd42,,,  it other than the obvious
RJCp-ttFpd42,,,  well the solid white background can be
RJCp-ttFpd42,,,  really harsh most of the time there 's
RJCp-ttFpd42,,,  copious amount of text in the bullet
RJCp-ttFpd43,0.34,0.47,  point really oh and anything other than
RJCp-ttFpd43,,,  sleep boredom and let 's not
RJCp-ttFpd43,,,  forget the worst offender of all yep
RJCp-ttFpd43,,,  this is not a great slide but fear not
RJCp-ttFpd43,,,  loyal follower there is a better way
RJCp-ttFpd43,,,  let me talk you through sweet easy step
RJCp-ttFpd44,0.5,1.04,  to creating slide that make your
RJCp-ttFpd44,,,  audience a WoW instead of number one
RJCp-ttFpd44,,,  start on the back in the background a
RJCp-ttFpd44,,,  white background on the slide can be
RJCp-ttFpd44,,,  really harsh and often look unfinished
RJCp-ttFpd44,,,  rather than thought so unless you 're
RJCp-ttFpd45,1.06,1.17,  a really good graphic designer that can
RJCp-ttFpd45,,,  make it work it 's not what we recommend
RJCp-ttFpd45,,,  an easy way to improve the slide
RJCp-ttFpd45,,,  background is that add a picture be sure
RJCp-ttFpd45,,,  to use Creative Commons image or buy
RJCp-ttFpd45,,,  from a stock image website just make
RJCp-ttFpd46,1.19,1.3,  sure you do n't choose a really busy
RJCp-ttFpd46,,,  image a all often be distracting for
RJCp-ttFpd46,,,  your audience instead something nice and
RJCp-ttFpd46,,,  clean and in keeping with your plan if
RJCp-ttFpd46,,,  you want to take thing to the next
RJCp-ttFpd46,,,  level try this hack duplicate your image
RJCp-ttFpd47,1.33,1.46,  and put one on top of the other using
RJCp-ttFpd47,,,  the alignment tool go to artistic
RJCp-ttFpd47,,,  aspect choose blur and your image will
RJCp-ttFpd47,,,  will blur into the background like it
RJCp-ttFpd47,,,  ha a soft focus and if you then add a
RJCp-ttFpd47,,,  fade entrance animation and put the
RJCp-ttFpd48,1.48,1.59,  timing on after previous then when you
RJCp-ttFpd48,,,  come to your slide you start off with a
RJCp-ttFpd48,,,  crisp image which blend into the
RJCp-ttFpd48,,,  background nice and smoothly and reduces
RJCp-ttFpd48,,,  any risk of distraction
RJCp-ttFpd48,,,  hmm classy okay next up the logically
RJCp-ttFpd49,2.05,2.22,  named step to this time bullet point
RJCp-ttFpd49,,,  what do you think of bullet point
RJCp-ttFpd49,,,  precisely what a point do n't work too
RJCp-ttFpd49,,,  much text all at once mean the audience
RJCp-ttFpd49,,,  are just reading ahead and ignoring the
RJCp-ttFpd49,,,  print job one cut it down to the minimum
RJCp-ttFpd410,2.25,2.37,  text you need to convey the idea make
RJCp-ttFpd410,,,  each point it own text box so that it
RJCp-ttFpd410,,,  stand out clearly from the others but
RJCp-ttFpd410,,,  do n't let the text be cramped into each
RJCp-ttFpd410,,,  box instead give your text some
RJCp-ttFpd410,,,  breathing space viola increasing the
RJCp-ttFpd411,2.38,2.5,  size of the box or reducing the point
RJCp-ttFpd411,,,  size of the text but make sure it can be
RJCp-ttFpd411,,,  easily read make sure that all the box
RJCp-ttFpd411,,,  are the same size to next align
RJCp-ttFpd411,,,  everything and distribute the box
RJCp-ttFpd411,,,  evenly so that it 's all neatly laid out
RJCp-ttFpd412,2.52,3.05,  go to the Home tab and arrange to these
RJCp-ttFpd412,,,  and use a fly entrance animation I
RJCp-ttFpd412,,,  deal with each box in a click to focus
RJCp-ttFpd412,,,  your audience on the relevant content an
RJCp-ttFpd412,,,  advanced trick to bring even more
RJCp-ttFpd412,,,  sophistication is to adjust the
RJCp-ttFpd413,3.07,3.2,  transparency of the text box by right
RJCp-ttFpd413,,,  clicking tuning format shape then fill
RJCp-ttFpd413,,,  and drag the transparency slider about
RJCp-ttFpd413,,,  25 % is good that way your background
RJCp-ttFpd413,,,  image Peaks through bringing depth to
RJCp-ttFpd413,,,  the slide content but keeping the text
RJCp-ttFpd414,3.22,3.36,  legible uh I think I 'd have to agree
RJCp-ttFpd414,,,  with that
RJCp-ttFpd414,,,  thing are really hotting up now in the
RJCp-ttFpd414,,,  final step in which we 'll tackle that
RJCp-ttFpd414,,,  pesky clip up remember kid when it
RJCp-ttFpd414,,,  come to clipart just say no clipart
RJCp-ttFpd415,3.4,3.52,  give your slide all the sophistication
RJCp-ttFpd415,,,  of a child 's IT project is that the
RJCp-ttFpd415,,,  impression you want to give people
RJCp-ttFpd415,,,  probably not instead get yourself a set
RJCp-ttFpd415,,,  icon stock image website the great
RJCp-ttFpd415,,,  service it 's definitely an investment
RJCp-ttFpd416,3.54,4.07,  icon provide an easy
RJCp-ttFpd416,,,  visual language for your audience
RJCp-ttFpd416,,,  once you have your icon pop them into a
RJCp-ttFpd416,,,  box the same height is your point then
RJCp-ttFpd416,,,  copy the formatting of your point to
RJCp-ttFpd416,,,  your new box by using the soft copy
RJCp-ttFpd417,4.09,4.23,  shortcut of ctrl + Shift + C to copy the
RJCp-ttFpd417,,,  formatting from the text box and then
RJCp-ttFpd417,,,  ctrl + Shift + V to paste the formatting
RJCp-ttFpd417,,,  to the icon the final step is to group
RJCp-ttFpd417,,,  the electron and box together the
RJCp-ttFpd417,,,  keyboard shortcut is ctrl + G and then
RJCp-ttFpd418,4.25,4.38,  add a room animation to each icon group
RJCp-ttFpd418,,,  set the timing to with previous and in
RJCp-ttFpd418,,,  the animation pane drag each animation
RJCp-ttFpd418,,,  next to the corresponding text box
RJCp-ttFpd418,,,  animation okay it 's time for the big
RJCp-ttFpd418,,,  reveal
RJCp-ttFpd420,4.39,5.09,  one of the freak of these three easy
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  step now remember what we started with
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  rule exactly that slide doe not pas
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  the test but now cover much neater
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  slicker and more proficient and how do
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  you think your audience is going to
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  react to this kind of slide probably so
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  give it a go three simple step to
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  create much better slice that generates
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  a much better reaction
RJCp-ttFpd420,,,  seriously go do it now now

VCr7ZXNKz6A3,,,  example and the amount of detail you
VCr7ZXNKz6A3,,,  can use in your presentation number two
VCr7ZXNKz6A3,,,  one key message there should only be one
VCr7ZXNKz6A4,1.16,1.29,  key message in your presentation which
VCr7ZXNKz6A4,,,  act like the spinal cord to the
VCr7ZXNKz6A4,,,  presentation and hold everything else
VCr7ZXNKz6A4,,,  together summarize this in one powerful

VCr7ZXNKz6A5,,,  number that people remember thing in
VCr7ZXNKz6A5,,,  more than this and you will start to
VCr7ZXNKz6A6,1.51,2.08,  lose clarity in the presentation each
VCr7ZXNKz6A6,,,  main section is like a mini presentation
VCr7ZXNKz6A6,,,  it should have a beginning middle and
VCr7ZXNKz6A6,,,  end this make it easier to follow and
VCr7ZXNKz6A6,,,  help the audience remember the message
VCr7ZXNKz6A6,,,  it 's really important that you make a
VCr7ZXNKz6A7,2.1,2.22,  strong opening at the start of your
VCr7ZXNKz6A7,,,  presentation it 's the time we want to
VCr7ZXNKz6A7,,,  grab or D & C tension a many way of
VCr7ZXNKz6A7,,,  doing this for example you might start
VCr7ZXNKz6A7,,,  with a question or a quote or an
VCr7ZXNKz6A7,,,  important fact to actually arouse in
VCr7ZXNKz6A8,2.25,2.36,  it 's also very important that your
VCr7ZXNKz6A8,,,  opening is six synced and clear this
VCr7ZXNKz6A8,,,  will set the tone for the rest of the
VCr7ZXNKz6A8,,,  presentation
VCr7ZXNKz6A8,,,  learn it off by heart practice your
VCr7ZXNKz6A8,,,  opening in the mirror many time so that
VCr7ZXNKz6A9,2.39,2.52,  it really becomes part of you this will
VCr7ZXNKz6A9,,,  give you an added confidence when you
VCr7ZXNKz6A9,,,  begin your presentation and it will help
VCr7ZXNKz6A9,,,  you to avoid the classic UNH 's Anders
VCr7ZXNKz6A9,,,  that are very common when people are
VCr7ZXNKz6A9,,,  nervous and hesitant when you practice
VCr7ZXNKz6A10,2.55,3.12,  in the mirror smile at yourself and see
VCr7ZXNKz6A10,,,  how it feel quite often you will need
VCr7ZXNKz6A10,,,  to use a visual aid this may be a flip
VCr7ZXNKz6A10,,,  chart or an OHP but most commonly it is
VCr7ZXNKz6A10,,,  PowerPoint address the interview panel
VCr7ZXNKz6A10,,,  at the start of the presentation before
VCr7ZXNKz6A11,3.14,3.25,  starting the slideshow this will help
VCr7ZXNKz6A11,,,  you to build rapport with the panel to
VCr7ZXNKz6A11,,,  start and will also get the impression
VCr7ZXNKz6A11,,,  that it is you who is controlling the
VCr7ZXNKz6A11,,,  presentation rather than the PowerPoint
VCr7ZXNKz6A11,,,  controlling you take your time to change
VCr7ZXNKz6A12,3.29,3.42,  slide pause and allow the panel to take
VCr7ZXNKz6A12,,,  in what is on the screen before speaking
VCr7ZXNKz6A12,,,  they need time to assimilate what ha
VCr7ZXNKz6A12,,,  just been said and to absorb the
VCr7ZXNKz6A12,,,  information on the new slide before you
VCr7ZXNKz6A12,,,  start to speak it will also give you
VCr7ZXNKz6A13,3.45,4,  time to gather your thought before you
VCr7ZXNKz6A13,,,  begin to speak
VCr7ZXNKz6A13,,,  remember to direct your delivery to the
VCr7ZXNKz6A13,,,  panel not the screen a voice referring
VCr7ZXNKz6A13,,,  back to the screen for prompt if you do
VCr7ZXNKz6A13,,,  this your voice will trail off a you
VCr7ZXNKz6A14,4.02,4.16,  turn your head away from the audience
VCr7ZXNKz6A14,,,  and this will reduce the impact of your
VCr7ZXNKz6A14,,,  message instead use your laptop arrange
VCr7ZXNKz6A14,,,  carefully in front of you or use note
VCr7ZXNKz6A14,,,  or prompt card to give you the
VCr7ZXNKz6A14,,,  necessary prompt finally ensure you
VCr7ZXNKz6A15,4.2,4.35,  have tested the equipment before the
VCr7ZXNKz6A15,,,  presentation so that you are not thrown
VCr7ZXNKz6A15,,,  by any technical hitch that might
VCr7ZXNKz6A15,,,  occur finally it 's important to have a
VCr7ZXNKz6A15,,,  memorable ending a good ending leave the
VCr7ZXNKz6A15,,,  audience with a final thought to ponder

P4zxWqC_fCY1,0,0.11,  what do we understand by presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY1,,,  skill why
P4zxWqC_fCY1,,,  presentation skill are so important
P4zxWqC_fCY1,,,  first myth whenever i ask what is
P4zxWqC_fCY1,,,  presentation skill
P4zxWqC_fCY1,,,  generally the present generation student
P4zxWqC_fCY2,0.13,0.25,  they believe
P4zxWqC_fCY2,,,  there ha to be a power point if you
P4zxWqC_fCY2,,,  think that is presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY2,,,  you are wrong presentation mean
P4zxWqC_fCY2,,,  any idea any information that is there
P4zxWqC_fCY2,,,  in your mind when you want to share it
P4zxWqC_fCY3,0.27,0.36,  with others
P4zxWqC_fCY3,,,  when you are speaking about it when you
P4zxWqC_fCY3,,,  are communicating
P4zxWqC_fCY3,,,  with others related to your thought
P4zxWqC_fCY3,,,  idea
P4zxWqC_fCY3,,,  that is called a presentation now there
P4zxWqC_fCY4,0.38,0.52,  can be different
P4zxWqC_fCY4,,,  way of presentation sometimes you may
P4zxWqC_fCY4,,,  use certain aid certain tool
P4zxWqC_fCY4,,,  certain technique in order to create
P4zxWqC_fCY4,,,  not only your presentation but also to
P4zxWqC_fCY4,,,  present your presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY5,0.54,1.07,  what i 'm trying to say is please keep in
P4zxWqC_fCY5,,,  your mind
P4zxWqC_fCY5,,,  whatever you speak and communicate
P4zxWqC_fCY5,,,  in fact that is presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY5,,,  in order to connect the audience in
P4zxWqC_fCY5,,,  order to
P4zxWqC_fCY6,1.08,1.2,  attract the audience in order to grab
P4zxWqC_fCY6,,,  the attention of the audience
P4zxWqC_fCY6,,,  through different aid are just
P4zxWqC_fCY6,,,  acting a assistance to your
P4zxWqC_fCY6,,,  presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY6,,,  so if somebody say that you should be
P4zxWqC_fCY7,1.22,1.35,  good at presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY7,,,  what are they saying they are talking
P4zxWqC_fCY7,,,  about you having strong
P4zxWqC_fCY7,,,  command on three c 's one
P4zxWqC_fCY7,,,  communication second confidence
P4zxWqC_fCY7,,,  and three content i repeat
P4zxWqC_fCY8,1.38,1.47,  the three c 's that are very important
P4zxWqC_fCY8,,,  whenever
P4zxWqC_fCY8,,,  we talk about presentation skill the
P4zxWqC_fCY8,,,  first is
P4zxWqC_fCY8,,,  communication you all should be good
P4zxWqC_fCY8,,,  communicator
P4zxWqC_fCY9,1.49,1.58,  second you should be great at your
P4zxWqC_fCY9,,,  confidence level
P4zxWqC_fCY9,,,  and third the content that you want to
P4zxWqC_fCY9,,,  deliver
P4zxWqC_fCY9,,,  should be well prepared well drafted by
P4zxWqC_fCY9,,,  you one
P4zxWqC_fCY10,1.59,2.1,  if you fail to draft if you fail to
P4zxWqC_fCY10,,,  create
P4zxWqC_fCY10,,,  if you fail to grab the attention of the
P4zxWqC_fCY10,,,  audience
P4zxWqC_fCY10,,,  with your communication you can not be a
P4zxWqC_fCY10,,,  good presentator
P4zxWqC_fCY11,2.11,2.2,  so whenever we talk about presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY11,,,  skill
P4zxWqC_fCY11,,,  these are the common thing that you
P4zxWqC_fCY11,,,  have to keep in your mind
P4zxWqC_fCY11,,,  the main purpose remains these three
P4zxWqC_fCY11,,,  either we want to inform
P4zxWqC_fCY12,2.22,2.34,  or we want to persuade or we want to
P4zxWqC_fCY12,,,  educate
P4zxWqC_fCY12,,,  now information that is shared is again
P4zxWqC_fCY12,,,  part of presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY12,,,  when you are requesting others to act in
P4zxWqC_fCY12,,,  your
P4zxWqC_fCY13,2.34,2.44,  way or in your form or when you want
P4zxWqC_fCY13,,,  others to act according to your term
P4zxWqC_fCY13,,,  and condition
P4zxWqC_fCY13,,,  that is called a first weight your
P4zxWqC_fCY13,,,  parent
P4zxWqC_fCY13,,,  they might have persuaded you many time
P4zxWqC_fCY14,2.48,2.58,  a a child you might have persuaded your
P4zxWqC_fCY14,,,  parent
P4zxWqC_fCY14,,,  many a time a a friend you persuade
P4zxWqC_fCY14,,,  your friend many time
P4zxWqC_fCY14,,,  your friend say let u go and watch
P4zxWqC_fCY14,,,  some
P4zxWqC_fCY15,2.59,3.12,  movie in one of the theater the hero of
P4zxWqC_fCY15,,,  that particular movie
P4zxWqC_fCY15,,,  you do not like the actor who is
P4zxWqC_fCY15,,,  casted in that particular movie you do
P4zxWqC_fCY15,,,  not like him or her
P4zxWqC_fCY15,,,  so what are you going to do instead of
P4zxWqC_fCY16,3.15,3.24,  saying yes
P4zxWqC_fCY16,,,  you may persuade him to watch some other
P4zxWqC_fCY16,,,  movie
P4zxWqC_fCY16,,,  of your interest or choice so i hope i
P4zxWqC_fCY16,,,  cleared your doubt related to the word
P4zxWqC_fCY16,,,  persuade
P4zxWqC_fCY17,3.25,3.34,  persuasion is again very very important
P4zxWqC_fCY17,,,  because whenever we talk about sharing
P4zxWqC_fCY17,,,  our new idea
P4zxWqC_fCY17,,,  if you talk about proposal writing if
P4zxWqC_fCY17,,,  you talk about
P4zxWqC_fCY17,,,  agenda if you talk about group
P4zxWqC_fCY18,3.36,3.47,  discussion whenever you are
P4zxWqC_fCY18,,,  conveying people whenever you are
P4zxWqC_fCY18,,,  sharing some information to the people
P4zxWqC_fCY18,,,  you have to persuade them if you fail in
P4zxWqC_fCY18,,,  persuasion
P4zxWqC_fCY18,,,  people will reject if you are
P4zxWqC_fCY19,3.5,4,  successful in persuasion people will
P4zxWqC_fCY19,,,  accept your proposal
P4zxWqC_fCY19,,,  they 'll agree to your point and in the
P4zxWqC_fCY19,,,  group discussion
P4zxWqC_fCY19,,,  you will be in win situation so keep
P4zxWqC_fCY19,,,  this in your mind
P4zxWqC_fCY20,4.01,4.14,  whenever we talk about presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY20,,,  presentation talk about
P4zxWqC_fCY20,,,  three important purpose that can be
P4zxWqC_fCY20,,,  delivered that can be successfully
P4zxWqC_fCY20,,,  informed persuaded or educated with the
P4zxWqC_fCY20,,,  help of presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY21,4.16,4.28,  so always remember right now if you are
P4zxWqC_fCY21,,,  viewing this particular class in order
P4zxWqC_fCY21,,,  to connect
P4zxWqC_fCY21,,,  my student in order to grab the
P4zxWqC_fCY21,,,  attention of my student in order to see
P4zxWqC_fCY21,,,  that my student are fixed
P4zxWqC_fCY22,4.29,4.43,  to their screen i 'm using a tomb
P4zxWqC_fCY22,,,  i 'm sharing the slide and i 'm pinning it
P4zxWqC_fCY22,,,  up
P4zxWqC_fCY22,,,  so that everybody is viewing
P4zxWqC_fCY22,,,  the same slide i 'm hooking or i 'm
P4zxWqC_fCY22,,,  anchoring your
P4zxWqC_fCY23,4.44,4.56,  thought with the slide that i 'm
P4zxWqC_fCY23,,,  presenting
P4zxWqC_fCY23,,,  this is a part or a tool or assistance
P4zxWqC_fCY23,,,  that i get with the help of technology
P4zxWqC_fCY23,,,  but what is my presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY23,,,  my presentation is my speech that i
P4zxWqC_fCY24,4.58,5.07,  convey to you all
P4zxWqC_fCY24,,,  the information that i share with you
P4zxWqC_fCY24,,,  all to persuade
P4zxWqC_fCY24,,,  to make you all understand what are the
P4zxWqC_fCY24,,,  important thing that you have to keep in
P4zxWqC_fCY24,,,  your mind if you really want to have

P4zxWqC_fCY26,5.23,5.36,  thing that is inform
P4zxWqC_fCY26,,,  persuade and then educate
P4zxWqC_fCY26,,,  very important question generally when i
P4zxWqC_fCY26,,,  see student
P4zxWqC_fCY26,,,  preparing and presenting they forget
P4zxWqC_fCY26,,,  that there is an audience who is going
P4zxWqC_fCY27,5.38,5.5,  to watch them
P4zxWqC_fCY27,,,  who is going to view them and without
P4zxWqC_fCY27,,,  thinking about the audience
P4zxWqC_fCY27,,,  they just present deliver
P4zxWqC_fCY27,,,  or share the information that 's not the
P4zxWqC_fCY27,,,  right way of presentation dear
P4zxWqC_fCY28,5.52,6.06,  whenever you are presenting you should
P4zxWqC_fCY28,,,  have

P4zxWqC_fCY29,6.09,6.21,  that you want to deliver
P4zxWqC_fCY29,,,  where are you right now when are you
P4zxWqC_fCY29,,,  going to deliver the information
P4zxWqC_fCY29,,,  why you think your presentation is so
P4zxWqC_fCY29,,,  important
P4zxWqC_fCY29,,,  and how can you convince the audience i
P4zxWqC_fCY30,6.24,6.39,  repeat
P4zxWqC_fCY30,,,  the six critical question that every
P4zxWqC_fCY30,,,  presentator
P4zxWqC_fCY30,,,  must keep in his or her mind
P4zxWqC_fCY30,,,  is these six
P4zxWqC_fCY30,,,  so whenever we are talking about the
P4zxWqC_fCY31,6.41,6.51,  sixth critical question
P4zxWqC_fCY31,,,  keep this in your mind dear death why am
P4zxWqC_fCY31,,,  i presenting this particular
P4zxWqC_fCY31,,,  presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY31,,,  like when i wa watching your video you
P4zxWqC_fCY31,,,  people were very nervous
P4zxWqC_fCY32,6.53,7.06,  there wa lack of confidence you were
P4zxWqC_fCY32,,,  not even thinking that somebody
P4zxWqC_fCY32,,,  else is going to watch you or view you
P4zxWqC_fCY32,,,  the first thing that you should remember
P4zxWqC_fCY32,,,  is while presenting you need to convince
P4zxWqC_fCY32,,,  yourself
P4zxWqC_fCY33,7.06,7.17,  this is the first if you uh talk about
P4zxWqC_fCY33,,,  the thumb rule of presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY33,,,  you are going to convince other later so
P4zxWqC_fCY33,,,  for example if you think
P4zxWqC_fCY33,,,  60 people or 60 friend of mine are
P4zxWqC_fCY33,,,  going to listen to me
P4zxWqC_fCY34,7.19,7.29,  of course 60 are going to listen to you

P4zxWqC_fCY34,,,  it is you so who should have strong
P4zxWqC_fCY34,,,  command
P4zxWqC_fCY34,,,  it is you so never forget that it is you
P4zxWqC_fCY34,,,  who 's going to listen

P4zxWqC_fCY35,,,  you convince yourself
P4zxWqC_fCY35,,,  by building the confidence when can you
P4zxWqC_fCY35,,,  build up the confidence
P4zxWqC_fCY35,,,  when you have the clarity of what is it
P4zxWqC_fCY35,,,  that you want to present
P4zxWqC_fCY36,7.42,7.53,  so therefore these six question are
P4zxWqC_fCY36,,,  very very important
P4zxWqC_fCY36,,,  you should know whom you are going to
P4zxWqC_fCY36,,,  address what is it that you want to

P4zxWqC_fCY109,,,  coming from the different
P4zxWqC_fCY109,,,  uh industry or from the different
P4zxWqC_fCY109,,,  academy
P4zxWqC_fCY109,,,  academician or are they your family
P4zxWqC_fCY110,23,23.09,  member
P4zxWqC_fCY110,,,  are they their friend or are the

P4zxWqC_fCY111,23.11,23.24,  based on the knowledge of the audience
P4zxWqC_fCY111,,,  you should design and draft say for
P4zxWqC_fCY111,,,  example if your teacher say
P4zxWqC_fCY111,,,  you 're going to present a presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY111,,,  in front of your class so remember yes
P4zxWqC_fCY111,,,  of course your teacher is
P4zxWqC_fCY112,23.25,23.36,  knowledgeable present but you should
P4zxWqC_fCY112,,,  also know that along with your teacher
P4zxWqC_fCY112,,,  there are 50 odd student of your class
P4zxWqC_fCY112,,,  who are going to listen to your
P4zxWqC_fCY112,,,  presentation so if you try to
P4zxWqC_fCY112,,,  boost your knowledge if you really try
P4zxWqC_fCY113,23.39,23.48,  to say that i know
P4zxWqC_fCY113,,,  too much and my friend they do not so
P4zxWqC_fCY113,,,  then you
P4zxWqC_fCY113,,,  are in fact discouraging your audience
P4zxWqC_fCY113,,,  you are not getting connected with your
P4zxWqC_fCY113,,,  audience
P4zxWqC_fCY114,23.49,23.59,  so do n't boast in front of your audience
P4zxWqC_fCY114,,,  try to connect with them how can you
P4zxWqC_fCY114,,,  connect with them when you remember the
P4zxWqC_fCY114,,,  three
P4zxWqC_fCY114,,,  the magic three s that we have discussed
P4zxWqC_fCY114,,,  every time
P4zxWqC_fCY115,24,24.09,  the presentation that you 're going to
P4zxWqC_fCY115,,,  present should be short simple
P4zxWqC_fCY115,,,  and straightforward so that the people
P4zxWqC_fCY115,,,  whosoever are listening
P4zxWqC_fCY115,,,  they can very well get connected with
P4zxWqC_fCY115,,,  your speech so
P4zxWqC_fCY116,24.1,24.2,  know what you want to present how much
P4zxWqC_fCY116,,,  information that you want to share
P4zxWqC_fCY116,,,  do n't show any kind of dissimilarity oh
P4zxWqC_fCY116,,,  i can
P4zxWqC_fCY116,,,  speak good english you ca n't i can
P4zxWqC_fCY116,,,  present very well you ca n't
P4zxWqC_fCY117,24.22,24.35,  do n't uh try to humiliate others if you
P4zxWqC_fCY117,,,  try to humiliate
P4zxWqC_fCY117,,,  others in fact in return you 're going to
P4zxWqC_fCY117,,,  get the same kind of humiliation
P4zxWqC_fCY117,,,  so do n't create that disparity know
P4zxWqC_fCY117,,,  about the age know about the gender
P4zxWqC_fCY118,24.37,24.48,  and then present your speech accordingly
P4zxWqC_fCY118,,,  also many time it may happen that
P4zxWqC_fCY118,,,  people may
P4zxWqC_fCY118,,,  feel comfortable in certain language
P4zxWqC_fCY118,,,  say for example when you are interacting
P4zxWqC_fCY118,,,  with the people who are there in the
P4zxWqC_fCY119,24.5,25.02,  village
P4zxWqC_fCY119,,,  who may not be good in understanding
P4zxWqC_fCY119,,,  english language and if you present your
P4zxWqC_fCY119,,,  complete presentation
P4zxWqC_fCY119,,,  in english you 're committing a crime
P4zxWqC_fCY119,,,  according to the understanding according
P4zxWqC_fCY120,25.05,25.14,  to the level
P4zxWqC_fCY120,,,  of the knowledge that the audience ha
P4zxWqC_fCY120,,,  you have to
P4zxWqC_fCY120,,,  change your presentation and that is the
P4zxWqC_fCY120,,,  reason every now and then i keep telling
P4zxWqC_fCY120,,,  you
P4zxWqC_fCY121,25.14,25.24,  all of course english is important but
P4zxWqC_fCY121,,,  apart from
P4zxWqC_fCY121,,,  english you should work out on different
P4zxWqC_fCY121,,,  language
P4zxWqC_fCY121,,,  the more number of language you know
P4zxWqC_fCY121,,,  you will be able to

P4zxWqC_fCY147,,,  proximity all right
P4zxWqC_fCY147,,,  remember the social distancing that we
P4zxWqC_fCY148,30.47,30.55,  have talked
P4zxWqC_fCY148,,,  we talked about the space when we were
P4zxWqC_fCY148,,,  talking about the different
P4zxWqC_fCY148,,,  form of communication we have discussed
P4zxWqC_fCY148,,,  that there are two important form of
P4zxWqC_fCY148,,,  communication
P4zxWqC_fCY149,30.56,31.06,  verbal and non under verbal we
P4zxWqC_fCY149,,,  discus
P4zxWqC_fCY149,,,  it could be oral or written when we talk
P4zxWqC_fCY149,,,  about non
P4zxWqC_fCY149,,,  we have clearly identified that it could
P4zxWqC_fCY149,,,  be related to body
P4zxWqC_fCY150,31.08,31.18,  it could be related to sign and it could
P4zxWqC_fCY150,,,  be related to symbol
P4zxWqC_fCY150,,,  when we talk about body the space the
P4zxWqC_fCY150,,,  distance that we
P4zxWqC_fCY150,,,  maintain between a person and to the

P4zxWqC_fCY151,,,  from a person to the person the common
P4zxWqC_fCY151,,,  thing that you all must have come to
P4zxWqC_fCY151,,,  know
P4zxWqC_fCY151,,,  during the covert time social distancing
P4zxWqC_fCY152,31.3,31.39,  that is a gap of eight foot minimum four
P4zxWqC_fCY152,,,  foot to
P4zxWqC_fCY152,,,  eight foot is called a social
P4zxWqC_fCY152,,,  distancing
P4zxWqC_fCY152,,,  so you should know when you are
P4zxWqC_fCY152,,,  presenting where you should stand
P4zxWqC_fCY153,31.41,31.51,  what should be the gap between you and
P4zxWqC_fCY153,,,  your audience are you going to be
P4zxWqC_fCY153,,,  very close to them if you have a mic can
P4zxWqC_fCY153,,,  you be

P4zxWqC_fCY155,,,  raise the voice
P4zxWqC_fCY155,,,  how you 're going to be loud that is the

P4zxWqC_fCY156,32.17,32.28,  you to be
P4zxWqC_fCY156,,,  loud so that even the person or even if
P4zxWqC_fCY156,,,  the mic
P4zxWqC_fCY156,,,  is not able to grab the voice but
P4zxWqC_fCY156,,,  because of the loud voice it can
P4zxWqC_fCY156,,,  understand it can grab or it can
P4zxWqC_fCY157,32.3,32.41,  connect with the audience in a right way

P4zxWqC_fCY166,34.17,34.26,  a
P4zxWqC_fCY166,,,  negative when you 're folding arm and
P4zxWqC_fCY166,,,  when you 're paying attention to the
P4zxWqC_fCY166,,,  audience with a smile on your face
P4zxWqC_fCY166,,,  that mean you are a great listener
P4zxWqC_fCY166,,,  remember the posture that is always
P4zxWqC_fCY167,34.28,34.38,  shown or portrayed of swami vivekada
P4zxWqC_fCY167,,,  you will always see him with a smile
P4zxWqC_fCY167,,,  unfolded arm because he wa a great
P4zxWqC_fCY167,,,  listener he always
P4zxWqC_fCY167,,,  encouraged people to speak so that he
P4zxWqC_fCY167,,,  could listen and understand them
P4zxWqC_fCY168,34.4,34.51,  but if there is no smile and if you are
P4zxWqC_fCY168,,,  having that
P4zxWqC_fCY168,,,  long face nervousness could be seen on
P4zxWqC_fCY168,,,  your face and with your folded arm
P4zxWqC_fCY168,,,  this show that you are not ready to
P4zxWqC_fCY168,,,  accept what others are shaking
P4zxWqC_fCY169,34.53,35.05,  so shaking head again is a negative
P4zxWqC_fCY169,,,  part so always remember even when you
P4zxWqC_fCY169,,,  are observing the
P4zxWqC_fCY169,,,  audience when they are yawning when they
P4zxWqC_fCY169,,,  are smiling when they are folding up
P4zxWqC_fCY169,,,  when they raise their eyebrow or when
P4zxWqC_fCY170,35.07,35.17,  they look at you with the narrowed eye
P4zxWqC_fCY170,,,  always remember that they are showing
P4zxWqC_fCY170,,,  their disinterest
P4zxWqC_fCY170,,,  or bowed them when they are leaning down
P4zxWqC_fCY170,,,  again it talk about
P4zxWqC_fCY170,,,  uh their interest most of the time you
P4zxWqC_fCY171,35.19,35.27,  must have seen when you are very keen
P4zxWqC_fCY171,,,  when you are
P4zxWqC_fCY171,,,  grabbing attention or when you want to
P4zxWqC_fCY171,,,  know more
P4zxWqC_fCY171,,,  you immediately bend up so that is again
P4zxWqC_fCY171,,,  a plus point
P4zxWqC_fCY172,35.28,35.39,  but not the slouching in the seat not to
P4zxWqC_fCY172,,,  bend and closing their eye that is
P4zxWqC_fCY172,,,  again wrong thing
P4zxWqC_fCY172,,,  so you have to work out on these thing
P4zxWqC_fCY172,,,  you should also know and you should
P4zxWqC_fCY172,,,  also understand through the body
P4zxWqC_fCY173,35.41,35.5,  language of the audience
P4zxWqC_fCY173,,,  so when you are working on these again i
P4zxWqC_fCY173,,,  say
P4zxWqC_fCY173,,,  work out on your volume work out on the
P4zxWqC_fCY173,,,  tone
P4zxWqC_fCY173,,,  and work out on the face do n't be a very
P4zxWqC_fCY174,35.53,36.03,  fast reader or speaker
P4zxWqC_fCY174,,,  you should always work out on uh the
P4zxWqC_fCY174,,,  pace at which you 're going to
P4zxWqC_fCY174,,,  communicate with others the volume
P4zxWqC_fCY174,,,  matter a lot
P4zxWqC_fCY174,,,  along with the tonality of the voice
P4zxWqC_fCY175,36.06,36.14,  okay
P4zxWqC_fCY175,,,  when you do this you are going to
P4zxWqC_fCY175,,,  improve your
P4zxWqC_fCY175,,,  active listening skill you will be able
P4zxWqC_fCY175,,,  to understand
P4zxWqC_fCY175,,,  what your audience are trying to say and

yGQrYH9XOSE6,,,  a beginning introduce your research a
yGQrYH9XOSE6,,,  middle explain what you did and an end
yGQrYH9XOSE6,,,  discus your result when planning your
yGQrYH9XOSE7,1.29,1.39,  presentation you need to start with the
yGQrYH9XOSE7,,,  key message that you want to deliver
yGQrYH9XOSE7,,,  and then build your presentation around
yGQrYH9XOSE7,,,  u try to limit the message to three
yGQrYH9XOSE7,,,  otherwise you risk information overload
yGQrYH9XOSE7,,,  anything which doe n't fit with the
yGQrYH9XOSE8,1.41,1.5,  message doe n't belong in a presentation
yGQrYH9XOSE8,,,  and need to be taken out to prevent you
yGQrYH9XOSE8,,,  from going off topic resist the
yGQrYH9XOSE8,,,  temptation to put everything you know
yGQrYH9XOSE8,,,  about a topic into your presentation you
yGQrYH9XOSE8,,,  want to avoid overloading your audience
yGQrYH9XOSE9,1.54,2.03,  have you thought about your audience if
yGQrYH9XOSE9,,,  you 're working or something really
yGQrYH9XOSE9,,,  specialist will people understand what
yGQrYH9XOSE9,,,  you 're trying to communicate to them
yGQrYH9XOSE9,,,  take some time to break down any
yGQrYH9XOSE9,,,  technical jargon so that non expert can
yGQrYH9XOSE10,2.05,2.15,  understand what you 're talking about or
yGQrYH9XOSE10,,,  just leave some space in your
yGQrYH9XOSE10,,,  presentation for explanation we all do
yGQrYH9XOSE10,,,  it we all have term and
yGQrYH9XOSE10,,,  name that we work with every day so
yGQrYH9XOSE10,,,  much so that they become a second
yGQrYH9XOSE11,2.16,2.29,  language and we often forget that others
yGQrYH9XOSE11,,,  might have no idea what we 're talking
yGQrYH9XOSE11,,,  about in short presentation timing is
yGQrYH9XOSE11,,,  everything and can make or break a
yGQrYH9XOSE11,,,  presentation too little information and
yGQrYH9XOSE11,,,  you 're left with silence at the end too
yGQrYH9XOSE12,2.31,2.41,  much and you 'll overrun or have to skip
yGQrYH9XOSE12,,,  over section which look unprofessional
yGQrYH9XOSE12,,,  know in advance how long you have to
yGQrYH9XOSE12,,,  present and how long you have four
yGQrYH9XOSE12,,,  question if you 're presenting a a
yGQrYH9XOSE12,,,  group decide how to divide your labor
yGQrYH9XOSE13,2.43,2.54,  who will be responsible for what part
yGQrYH9XOSE13,,,  how long will each section be rehearse
yGQrYH9XOSE13,,,  your presentation with a timer set for
yGQrYH9XOSE13,,,  how long you have if you go over you
yGQrYH9XOSE13,,,  need to decide what to cut or end it
yGQrYH9XOSE13,,,  down planning is the key to success
yGQrYH9XOSE14,2.57,3.08,  craft your presentation based around
yGQrYH9XOSE14,,,  your key message and think about
yGQrYH9XOSE14,,,  structure and flow you have your key
yGQrYH9XOSE14,,,  message and that can really help you to
yGQrYH9XOSE14,,,  structure the rest of your presentation
yGQrYH9XOSE14,,,  always keep that key message in the back
yGQrYH9XOSE15,3.1,3.21,  of your mind keep it on a post no
yGQrYH9XOSE15,,,  next to your computer if something
yGQrYH9XOSE15,,,  doe n't fit with your key message then
yGQrYH9XOSE15,,,  it doe n't need to be in your
yGQrYH9XOSE15,,,  presentation be strict storyboard your
yGQrYH9XOSE15,,,  presentation this work quite well if
yGQrYH9XOSE16,3.23,3.33,  you 're a visual planner it sound
yGQrYH9XOSE16,,,  obvious but you need to have a logical
yGQrYH9XOSE16,,,  flow to your presentation a beginning a
yGQrYH9XOSE16,,,  middle and an end at the end summarize
yGQrYH9XOSE16,,,  your presentation and reiterate your top
yGQrYH9XOSE16,,,  takeaway message always leave room for
yGQrYH9XOSE17,3.36,3.46,  question but do n't feel this ha to be
yGQrYH9XOSE17,,,  the very last thing you do you can ask a
yGQrYH9XOSE17,,,  feedback a you go through if you 're
yGQrYH9XOSE17,,,  comfortable with u but it ca n't disrupt
yGQrYH9XOSE17,,,  your flow if you want to wait until the
yGQrYH9XOSE17,,,  end of the presentation that habit is
yGQrYH9XOSE18,3.47,3.59,  the second to last thing this mean that
yGQrYH9XOSE18,,,  you can leave the audience with a good
yGQrYH9XOSE18,,,  final impression leave them with a
yGQrYH9XOSE18,,,  message you want to leave them with
yGQrYH9XOSE18,,,  design is not an add to your
yGQrYH9XOSE18,,,  presentation it 's part of how you tell
yGQrYH9XOSE19,4.01,4.15,  your story the style and design of
yGQrYH9XOSE19,,,  slide or visual aid shape the overall
yGQrYH9XOSE19,,,  feel of your presentation
yGQrYH9XOSE19,,,  and slide also help you to keep on
yGQrYH9XOSE19,,,  track the really basic stuff that go
yGQrYH9XOSE19,,,  almost without saying I think about your
yGQrYH9XOSE20,4.17,4.27,  font size font are great if used well
yGQrYH9XOSE20,,,  but limit them to about three per side
yGQrYH9XOSE20,,,  anymore is distracting any smaller than
yGQrYH9XOSE20,,,  a size 24 text and you 're putting too
yGQrYH9XOSE20,,,  much text on the slide
yGQrYH9XOSE20,,,  remember this is a visual aid not a
yGQrYH9XOSE21,4.29,4.4,  document in it own right if you 're
yGQrYH9XOSE21,,,  trying to put more than around 50 word
yGQrYH9XOSE21,,,  on a slide you 're writing a handout not
yGQrYH9XOSE21,,,  a presentation think about your color
yGQrYH9XOSE21,,,  choice certain color just do n't belong
yGQrYH9XOSE21,,,  together and others make text harder to
yGQrYH9XOSE22,4.41,4.53,  read think about accessibility issue
yGQrYH9XOSE22,,,  for people who may be color blind if you
yGQrYH9XOSE22,,,  have to use animation to make a point do
yGQrYH9XOSE22,,,  with a little fuss a possible if you
yGQrYH9XOSE22,,,  need to display some data make sure it 's
yGQrYH9XOSE22,,,  relevant clear and easy to read do n't
yGQrYH9XOSE23,4.56,5.11,  have something that you have to say you
yGQrYH9XOSE23,,,  ca n't see on this graph but the result
yGQrYH9XOSE23,,,  show San serif font such a Calibri and
yGQrYH9XOSE23,,,  Arial are much more readable than serif
yGQrYH9XOSE23,,,  font such a Times New Roman font like
yGQrYH9XOSE23,,,  Comic Sans are best saved for personal
yGQrYH9XOSE24,5.13,5.31,  not professional use one slide equal
yGQrYH9XOSE24,,,  one idea do n't overload your slide
yGQrYH9XOSE24,,,  having one key idea per slide make it
yGQrYH9XOSE24,,,  easy for your audience to follow and
yGQrYH9XOSE24,,,  help you to pace your presentation well
yGQrYH9XOSE24,,,  avoid the wall of doom the wall of doom
yGQrYH9XOSE25,5.34,5.44,  or a wall of text is what happens when
yGQrYH9XOSE25,,,  you put fart image text on a slide it 's
yGQrYH9XOSE25,,,  overwhelming and distracting there 's no
yGQrYH9XOSE25,,,  point in just reading out a huge amount
yGQrYH9XOSE25,,,  of text from a slide the point of a
yGQrYH9XOSE25,,,  presentation is n't just to read a paper
yGQrYH9XOSE26,5.46,5.57,  and if your audience are trying to read
yGQrYH9XOSE26,,,  your slide then they wo n't be listening
yGQrYH9XOSE26,,,  to what it is that you 're saying bullet
yGQrYH9XOSE26,,,  point can help break down complex
yGQrYH9XOSE26,,,  information into simple key word or
yGQrYH9XOSE26,,,  idea but if use of every slide they can
yGQrYH9XOSE27,5.59,6.12,  look crowded monotonous and repetitive
yGQrYH9XOSE27,,,  if you are using bullet point keep them
yGQrYH9XOSE27,,,  short and do n't draw them out of
yGQrYH9XOSE27,,,  multiple line a well graph
yGQrYH9XOSE27,,,  or figure can be an effective way of
yGQrYH9XOSE27,,,  displaying information at a glance and
yGQrYH9XOSE28,6.13,6.25,  could communicate more than a wall of
yGQrYH9XOSE28,,,  text but it 's worth thinking about what
yGQrYH9XOSE28,,,  type of chart or graph is best to convey
yGQrYH9XOSE28,,,  your data because a poorly used graph
yGQrYH9XOSE28,,,  can be off image can help break
yGQrYH9XOSE28,,,  up text on a slide use them to reinforce
yGQrYH9XOSE29,6.27,6.4,  a point or a a visual metaphor
yGQrYH9XOSE29,,,  remember to source Creative Commons
yGQrYH9XOSE29,,,  image not every image that you find on
yGQrYH9XOSE29,,,  the Internet can be legally used you
yGQrYH9XOSE29,,,  want to avoid this water
yGQrYH9XOSE29,,,  mark and pixelated image look
yGQrYH9XOSE30,6.42,6.56,  seriously unprofessional everyone is
yGQrYH9XOSE30,,,  nervous before a presentation you can
yGQrYH9XOSE30,,,  help yourself by being prepared taking
yGQrYH9XOSE30,,,  some time to relax even if that mean
yGQrYH9XOSE30,,,  taking ten second to breathe before
yGQrYH9XOSE30,,,  starting think about your body language
yGQrYH9XOSE31,6.59,7.09,  you might be terrified inside but try
yGQrYH9XOSE31,,,  not to show it on the outside do n't fold
yGQrYH9XOSE31,,,  your arm a it 's a defensive position
yGQrYH9XOSE31,,,  and will close you off to your audience
yGQrYH9XOSE31,,,  whether you mean to or not if you 're
yGQrYH9XOSE31,,,  presenting from a podium you can use it
yGQrYH9XOSE32,7.11,7.23,  to hide your shaking knee to start with
yGQrYH9XOSE32,,,  but do n't be afraid to move around
yGQrYH9XOSE32,,,  either keep your body language open and
yGQrYH9XOSE32,,,  smile if you find a friendly face in the
yGQrYH9XOSE32,,,  audience present to them or even better
yGQrYH9XOSE32,,,  find a few spot in the audience left
yGQrYH9XOSE33,7.25,7.36,  center right and move between looking at
yGQrYH9XOSE33,,,  those point throughout your
yGQrYH9XOSE33,,,  presentation doe someone have a cool
yGQrYH9XOSE33,,,  hair color are they wearing an
yGQrYH9XOSE33,,,  interesting top whatever it is use those
yGQrYH9XOSE33,,,  point to keep engaging with your
yGQrYH9XOSE34,7.37,7.5,  audience and do n't spend too long
yGQrYH9XOSE34,,,  looking at your note or at your own
yGQrYH9XOSE34,,,  slide would you be come to a presenting
yGQrYH9XOSE34,,,  without a script now this is an entirely
yGQrYH9XOSE34,,,  personal choice but it come back to
yGQrYH9XOSE34,,,  that eye contact and engagement with
yGQrYH9XOSE35,7.52,8,  your audience if you 're buried in your
yGQrYH9XOSE35,,,  note and do n't look up at all then
yGQrYH9XOSE35,,,  you 've lost your audience before you 've
yGQrYH9XOSE35,,,  even begun
yGQrYH9XOSE35,,,  you could have note on your slide and
yGQrYH9XOSE35,,,  see them in presenter mode but I would
yGQrYH9XOSE36,8.02,8.11,  recommend that you try to present
yGQrYH9XOSE36,,,  without the script or possibly even
yGQrYH9XOSE36,,,  without note wherever you can that way
yGQrYH9XOSE36,,,  your speech is more free and you 're able
yGQrYH9XOSE36,,,  to use your hand so gesture and be more
yGQrYH9XOSE36,,,  natural and presenting it is scary but
yGQrYH9XOSE37,8.14,8.26,  you ca n't do it with practice and a good
yGQrYH9XOSE37,,,  knowledge of your subject matter be
yGQrYH9XOSE37,,,  prepared and know your material this
yGQrYH9XOSE37,,,  will help you to anticipate the
yGQrYH9XOSE37,,,  question you are likely to get do n't be
yGQrYH9XOSE37,,,  afraid to admit that you do n't know but
yGQrYH9XOSE38,8.28,8.4,  do offer to find a solution try to be
yGQrYH9XOSE38,,,  clear but brief you can always check if
yGQrYH9XOSE38,,,  you 've answered that question when they
yGQrYH9XOSE38,,,  finished do n't be afraid to clarify the
yGQrYH9XOSE38,,,  question and make sure the rest of the
yGQrYH9XOSE38,,,  audience heard the question and if
yGQrYH9XOSE39,8.41,8.52,  necessary repeat it for them this mean
yGQrYH9XOSE39,,,  that the audience know what you 're
yGQrYH9XOSE39,,,  talking about
yGQrYH9XOSE39,,,  and it give you extra thinking time
yGQrYH9XOSE39,,,  what happens when thing go wrong the
yGQrYH9XOSE39,,,  most important thing to do is
yGQrYH9XOSE40,8.54,9.04,  calm the easiest way to prevent
yGQrYH9XOSE40,,,  disastrous prepare beforehand make sure
yGQrYH9XOSE40,,,  the technology is working check it is
yGQrYH9XOSE40,,,  compatible with what you want to do
yGQrYH9XOSE40,,,  scoop up the room so you know the layout
yGQrYH9XOSE40,,,  and feel more comfortable have a back
yGQrYH9XOSE41,9.06,9.19,  plan have your slide saved in different
yGQrYH9XOSE41,,,  place or have a paper copy for real
yGQrYH9XOSE41,,,  disaster chance are something might go
yGQrYH9XOSE41,,,  wrong it 's how you handle it that make
yGQrYH9XOSE41,,,  a difference and remember the audience
yGQrYH9XOSE41,,,  wo n't always know there 's being the
yGQrYH9XOSE43,9.2,9.39,  problem unless you let it show be clear
yGQrYH9XOSE43,,,  about what you are meant to be doing

yGQrYH9XOSE43,,,  point and practice practice practice

Uk_FtRshypI1,0,0.15,  In this lecture we 're looking at
Uk_FtRshypI1,,,  highlighting visual aid and that mean
Uk_FtRshypI1,,,  two thing : first focusing the audience 's
Uk_FtRshypI1,,,  attention on your visual aid ; and second
Uk_FtRshypI1,,,  stating the visual 's general meaning . When
Uk_FtRshypI1,,,  you are presenting a visual aid to the
Uk_FtRshypI2,0.17,0.32,  audience and you want them to look at it
Uk_FtRshypI2,,,  to pay attention to it there are some
Uk_FtRshypI2,,,  key expression that you can use .
Uk_FtRshypI2,,,  Probably the most common is this :
Uk_FtRshypI2,,,  `` Ok let 's take a look at this slide ; '' or `` Ok
Uk_FtRshypI2,,,  let 's take a look at this chart . ''
Uk_FtRshypI3,0.33,0.49,  `` Ok let 's take a look at this graph . '' Or if
Uk_FtRshypI3,,,  you want to speak more formally in a
Uk_FtRshypI3,,,  very formal presentation you may use
Uk_FtRshypI3,,,  this expression : `` I 'd like to draw your
Uk_FtRshypI3,,,  attention to this chart . '' Or `` I 'd like to
Uk_FtRshypI3,,,  draw your attention to this graph . '' 
Uk_FtRshypI4,0.52,1.01,  more formal expression there . So that 's
Uk_FtRshypI4,,,  focusing the audience 's attention . In
Uk_FtRshypI4,,,  other word you just saying to the
Uk_FtRshypI4,,,  audience `` look at this slide . ''
Uk_FtRshypI4,,,  `` Look at this chart . '' `` Look at this graph . ''
Uk_FtRshypI4,,,  Now that 's the first step . The second
Uk_FtRshypI5,1.05,1.18,  step is to tell the audience what they
Uk_FtRshypI5,,,  are looking at . What is it ?
Uk_FtRshypI5,,,  And here are some expression here for
Uk_FtRshypI5,,,  doing that : `` As you can see this is our
Uk_FtRshypI5,,,  sale data for the past quarter . '' `` Here we
Uk_FtRshypI5,,,  can see the number of word spoken per
Uk_FtRshypI6,1.2,1.38,  minute . '' `` Here we can see the growth of
Uk_FtRshypI6,,,  bacteria over time . '' So stating the visual 's
Uk_FtRshypI6,,,  general meaning . You might also choose to
Uk_FtRshypI6,,,  use one of these expression :
Uk_FtRshypI6,,,  `` This slide show our sale data . '' `` This next
Uk_FtRshypI6,,,  chart illustrates the number of word
Uk_FtRshypI7,1.4,1.56,  spoken ; '' or `` This graph refers to the
Uk_FtRshypI7,,,  growth of bacteria over time . '' So some
Uk_FtRshypI7,,,  various expression there for stating
Uk_FtRshypI7,,,  the visual 's general meaning ; in other
Uk_FtRshypI7,,,  word answering the question `` What are we
Uk_FtRshypI7,,,  looking at ? ''
Uk_FtRshypI8,1.57,2.09,  And another way to do that if you have a
Uk_FtRshypI8,,,  line graph is to talk about the
Uk_FtRshypI8,,,  different type of line and we 're going
Uk_FtRshypI8,,,  to get into much more detail in the
Uk_FtRshypI8,,,  upcoming lecture and you 'll get a lot
Uk_FtRshypI8,,,  more information from the supplement to
Uk_FtRshypI9,2.12,2.24,  this lecture
Uk_FtRshypI9,,,  but basically in a line graph there are
Uk_FtRshypI9,,,  three type of line : there 's a solid
Uk_FtRshypI9,,,  line ; a broken line ; and a dotted line . And
Uk_FtRshypI9,,,  you can use these with various verb : so
Uk_FtRshypI9,,,  the solid line show the growth over
Uk_FtRshypI10,2.28,2.44,  time ; the broken line illustrates
Uk_FtRshypI10,,,  employee retention ; the dotted line
Uk_FtRshypI10,,,  refers to sale figure . So three type
Uk_FtRshypI10,,,  of line and again we 're going to get
Uk_FtRshypI10,,,  more into that later .
Uk_FtRshypI10,,,  So let 's take a look at some expression
Uk_FtRshypI11,2.47,3.04,  in action for highlighting visual aid ...
Uk_FtRshypI11,,,  Tis graphic illustrates the location
Uk_FtRshypI11,,,  of English speaker throughout the world
Uk_FtRshypI11,,,  a you can see ...
Uk_FtRshypI11,,,  This next map show the ubiquity of English . As you
Uk_FtRshypI11,,,  can see in most country english is spoken ...
Uk_FtRshypI13,3.1,3.34,  I would like to draw your attention to
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  this chart . As you can see two third of
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  the world 's scientist read academic
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  paper or journal in English while only
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  one of the world 's scientist read
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  in another language .
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  Ok so in this lecture we talked about
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  highlighting visual aid
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  this just mean focusing the attention
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  of the audience on your visual aid and
Uk_FtRshypI13,,,  stating the visual 's general meaning
upzjPKmMU8I1,0,0.12,  hi quasi Millington here is speaker and
upzjPKmMU8I1,,,  speech coach and today we 're going to
upzjPKmMU8I1,,,  talk about how to use visual aid
upzjPKmMU8I1,,,  effectively in the presentation when it
upzjPKmMU8I1,,,  come to using visual aid in a
upzjPKmMU8I1,,,  presentation I 'm reminded of a quote I
upzjPKmMU8I2,0.15,0.32,  once heard and said that audience will
upzjPKmMU8I2,,,  forgive you for anything during a
upzjPKmMU8I2,,,  presentation except being boring and
upzjPKmMU8I2,,,  you 've probably seen it a boring
upzjPKmMU8I2,,,  presentation that had visual aid and
upzjPKmMU8I2,,,  there are so many mistake that are made
upzjPKmMU8I3,0.34,0.49,  when using visual aid I probably wo n't
upzjPKmMU8I3,,,  cover them all but here are five thing
upzjPKmMU8I3,,,  not to do when you use visual aid
upzjPKmMU8I3,,,  the first thing not to do is do n't read
upzjPKmMU8I3,,,  from your note or your visual aid and
upzjPKmMU8I3,,,  just make it a reading lecture where
upzjPKmMU8I4,0.53,1.03,  you 're just reading off what 's on your
upzjPKmMU8I4,,,  slide that 's one of the worst thing
upzjPKmMU8I4,,,  that you can do if you have a lot of
upzjPKmMU8I4,,,  information to get across to your
upzjPKmMU8I4,,,  audience instead just scan and say so
upzjPKmMU8I4,,,  you have to rehearse to get this down
upzjPKmMU8I5,1.06,1.18,  and right but just scan the overall
upzjPKmMU8I5,,,  point you want to say whether it 's on a
upzjPKmMU8I5,,,  cue card or on a sheet just scan it and
upzjPKmMU8I5,,,  then look up at your audience always be
upzjPKmMU8I5,,,  looking at your audience when you 're
upzjPKmMU8I5,,,  talking never be looking down at a piece
upzjPKmMU8I6,1.2,1.33,  of paper or something else when you are
upzjPKmMU8I6,,,  talking next tip is do n't turn your back
upzjPKmMU8I6,,,  to read a lot of time you 'll see
upzjPKmMU8I6,,,  presenter they will have something on
upzjPKmMU8I6,,,  their slide and they will turn their
upzjPKmMU8I6,,,  back to the audience to read it try your
upzjPKmMU8I7,1.37,1.48,  best never have to have your back to
upzjPKmMU8I7,,,  your audience one way to make sure that
upzjPKmMU8I7,,,  you do that is to have note in front of
upzjPKmMU8I7,,,  you that match what you want to say on
upzjPKmMU8I7,,,  the slide so you can just gesture
upzjPKmMU8I7,,,  backwards towards your overhead or your
upzjPKmMU8I8,1.51,2.02,  slide and you never actually have to
upzjPKmMU8I8,,,  look at it you should know from the
upzjPKmMU8I8,,,  note you 're looking at where you are in
upzjPKmMU8I8,,,  your presentation and be able to click
upzjPKmMU8I8,,,  through once again rehearsal is key when
upzjPKmMU8I8,,,  you are preparing to give a presentation
upzjPKmMU8I9,2.05,2.15,  that ha visual aid in it the next tip
upzjPKmMU8I9,,,  tip number three is do n't write essay
upzjPKmMU8I9,,,  on your slide the worst thing you can do
upzjPKmMU8I9,,,  when I think speak
upzjPKmMU8I9,,,  to do this out of nerve is that they
upzjPKmMU8I9,,,  have all of their information on their
upzjPKmMU8I10,2.17,2.29,  slide and they just read all the
upzjPKmMU8I10,,,  information that 's on theirs like listen
upzjPKmMU8I10,,,  if I can deliver your presentation using
upzjPKmMU8I10,,,  your slide because it 's the same
upzjPKmMU8I10,,,  information that you 're saying then of
upzjPKmMU8I10,,,  what use are you a the speaker you want
upzjPKmMU8I11,2.32,2.44,  to make sure that your visual is just an
upzjPKmMU8I11,,,  accompaniment to you it just add to
upzjPKmMU8I11,,,  what you are going to say there should
upzjPKmMU8I11,,,  be point on there picture that need
upzjPKmMU8I11,,,  explanation so that it 's just a
upzjPKmMU8I11,,,  reference point but the audience is
upzjPKmMU8I12,2.47,2.56,  looking at you to give further
upzjPKmMU8I12,,,  information to what you have on the
upzjPKmMU8I12,,,  slide so do n't put essay on there put
upzjPKmMU8I12,,,  short point put picture put
upzjPKmMU8I12,,,  entertaining thing on slide even short
upzjPKmMU8I12,,,  video that add to you a the speaker
upzjPKmMU8I13,3,3.15,  not replace you tip number four is to
upzjPKmMU8I13,,,  use open posture if you can try not to
upzjPKmMU8I13,,,  have anything between you and your
upzjPKmMU8I13,,,  audience if you 're behind a lectern or
upzjPKmMU8I13,,,  stand try to not stand behind that if
upzjPKmMU8I13,,,  you can I know that in some situation
upzjPKmMU8I14,3.17,3.29,  is a more formal presentation and you
upzjPKmMU8I14,,,  have to do that but a much a you can
upzjPKmMU8I14,,,  get out from behind table and podium
upzjPKmMU8I14,,,  and anything blocking the audience from
upzjPKmMU8I14,,,  seeing you and really experiencing you
upzjPKmMU8I14,,,  a the speaker get those out of the way
upzjPKmMU8I15,3.32,3.43,  so that you can have an open
upzjPKmMU8I15,,,  communication with your audience and
upzjPKmMU8I15,,,  finally make it a dialogue just because
upzjPKmMU8I15,,,  you are the presenter and you have all
upzjPKmMU8I15,,,  this information on your slide that you
upzjPKmMU8I15,,,  have to give to your audience do n't
upzjPKmMU8I16,3.45,3.56,  assume that you should n't involve them
upzjPKmMU8I16,,,  sometimes you may want to just have a
upzjPKmMU8I16,,,  question mark on your slide and then you
upzjPKmMU8I16,,,  ask a question and you get dialogue back
upzjPKmMU8I16,,,  and forth from your audience you may get
upzjPKmMU8I16,,,  a discussion that way also it make you

upzjPKmMU8I17,,,  often seated so a lot of time you may
upzjPKmMU8I17,,,  have all the information to share but we
upzjPKmMU8I17,,,  may get a golden nugget of information
upzjPKmMU8I18,4.11,4.22,  from your audience by involving them
upzjPKmMU8I18,,,  asking them question say what do you
upzjPKmMU8I18,,,  think and make it a dialogue it make it
upzjPKmMU8I18,,,  a much more friendly and interesting

JF_m8AhkxuM1,0.13,0.46,  hello everyone welcome back to n p t e l mock course on developing soft skill and personality
JF_m8AhkxuM1,,,  this is week eight module number four lecture number forty six i am doctor ravichandran
JF_m8AhkxuM1,,,  from the department of humanity and social science of i i t kanpur giving you this course
JF_m8AhkxuM1,,,  now for the past eight week this is the concluding week and then i started with presentation
JF_m8AhkxuM1,,,  skill and this module this lecture will conclude our discussion on presentation skill giving
JF_m8AhkxuM1,,,  you more input on how to use visuals visuals is an aspect of non verbal communication along
JF_m8AhkxuM2,0.55,1.29,  with body language we also need to know how you can use this effectively before i start
JF_m8AhkxuM2,,,  let take a quick review of what i do in the previous lecture in the previous lecture i
JF_m8AhkxuM2,,,  ah addressed the issue of body language in public speaking i told you that the role of
JF_m8AhkxuM2,,,  body language is so crucial that some people use very effective body language and get away
JF_m8AhkxuM2,,,  with ah very fraudulent content also many politician for example they develop just
JF_m8AhkxuM2,,,  skill with le content and use powerful body language to convince the audience but
JF_m8AhkxuM3,1.36,2.06,  in order to you become a professional i emphasize that your content should be equally good a
JF_m8AhkxuM3,,,  well a your body language to make your body language good effective
JF_m8AhkxuM3,,,  what should you do practice before the mirror in today context even you can use video
JF_m8AhkxuM3,,,  captured on your mobile and then check that but nothing like mirror because you are doing
JF_m8AhkxuM3,,,  it live and then just see what are thing you do not like to see and you can make modification
JF_m8AhkxuM3,,,  appropriately thus suitable for the occasion do not hide when you are going to a podium
JF_m8AhkxuM4,2.14,2.44,  dont hide ok be open be honest and maintain eye contact with all even if somebody is very
JF_m8AhkxuM4,,,  difficult to maintain eye contact with try to look at the person forehead so do not try
JF_m8AhkxuM4,,,  to maintain the direct eye contact and try to maintain eye contact with those whom you
JF_m8AhkxuM4,,,  like initially and slowly you try to spread through the audience ok it can be in the form
JF_m8AhkxuM4,,,  of a triangle identify corner it can be in the form of a square and identify somebody
JF_m8AhkxuM4,,,  in the middle and then keep shifting your eye but then that will give the audience
JF_m8AhkxuM5,2.49,3.17,  that you are trying to maintain eye contact with all of them throughout do not shift leg
JF_m8AhkxuM5,,,  that is one leg up and then the other leg down so dont do that kind of movement do
JF_m8AhkxuM5,,,  not hold on to anything that is holding something very firmly is indicating that you are nervous
JF_m8AhkxuM5,,,  sometimes people hold on the chair that is kept before them they hold on to the desk
JF_m8AhkxuM5,,,  that is kept before them they hold on to even choke piece ah giving the impression that
JF_m8AhkxuM5,,,  a if they are going to smock ah a it if look like a cigarette they hold on thing
JF_m8AhkxuM6,3.22,3.56,  they hold on pencil they hold on scale they hold on the pointer
JF_m8AhkxuM6,,,  now try to keep them on the table use them only when it is required so do not hold on
JF_m8AhkxuM6,,,  to anything and all the time try to face the audience whether you create a very amicable
JF_m8AhkxuM6,,,  response from them or not face the audience so you should be bold enough to face the audience
JF_m8AhkxuM6,,,  and keep the palm open so dont try to ah close it dont try to cross it dont try to put it
JF_m8AhkxuM6,,,  in your ah hand pocket keep it to open speak loudly and clearly in fact it 's the first
JF_m8AhkxuM7,4.04,4.35,  thing you should be doing when you go there a a professional to check whether everybody
JF_m8AhkxuM7,,,  in the audience is able to hear you clearly and maintain a normal face do not speak too
JF_m8AhkxuM7,,,  fast do not be deliberately to slow ok in both case you are exhibiting that you are
JF_m8AhkxuM7,,,  nervous never slouch ok instead of a firm think that slouching is and then appearing
JF_m8AhkxuM7,,,  to be too low because of the fact that you are low in confidence and never turn back
JF_m8AhkxuM7,,,  to the audience or even if you are going to show something on the black board till try
JF_m8AhkxuM8,4.4,5.16,  to maintain at least half eye contact with them never turn your back so that way you
JF_m8AhkxuM8,,,  will completely loose contact with the audience let look at the use of visuals now what are
JF_m8AhkxuM8,,,  visuals first of all so visuals are those ah non verbal part of communication in which
JF_m8AhkxuM8,,,  you do not use word you do not use the verbal part but you use picture you show photograph
JF_m8AhkxuM8,,,  you can use graph pie chart map any kind of diagram and then ah the cross section
JF_m8AhkxuM8,,,  sectional diagram such a frontal view aerial view ok and even a model a proto type of something
JF_m8AhkxuM9,5.24,6.02,  which is bigger in size but you show a small module and the blueprint of a a house or
JF_m8AhkxuM9,,,  of a big project that you are planning to ah materialize
JF_m8AhkxuM9,,,  now these thing without word but they are shown in a form of visuals now using visuals
JF_m8AhkxuM9,,,  actually enhances the quality of your presentation ok instead of putting just word if you put
JF_m8AhkxuM9,,,  some picture but then you should not deliberately put something like the face of every ah beautiful
JF_m8AhkxuM9,,,  actress and then so that everybody look at it but they will miss the main point of what
JF_m8AhkxuM10,6.07,6.43,  you are discussing that will be completely distracting and it will be completely inappropriate
JF_m8AhkxuM10,,,  of course people will be looking forward towards looking such picture but then the complete
JF_m8AhkxuM10,,,  message will be lost and people in fact will be laughing at you for using such inappropriate
JF_m8AhkxuM10,,,  picture so what is the purpose of visuals visuals illustrate key point
JF_m8AhkxuM10,,,  so it 's very easy to show a picture a it is said a picture is worth thousand word
JF_m8AhkxuM10,,,  instead of describing something in so many word just show them a picture ok it will
JF_m8AhkxuM11,6.49,7.27,  illustrate key point picture can also be used to reinforce verbal message you say something
JF_m8AhkxuM11,,,  you show it to them in the form of a visual it can be used to stimulate audience interest
JF_m8AhkxuM11,,,  so you want to introduce a new concept to some people who have no idea of what is that
JF_m8AhkxuM11,,,  so you can first show them the picture you can ask them what is this can you make a guess
JF_m8AhkxuM11,,,  what is the function why should we use this you can stimulate audience interest and in
JF_m8AhkxuM11,,,  time when the presentation becomes monotonous then you show them a visual so that attention
JF_m8AhkxuM12,7.34,8.11,  will be focused so you can focus audience attention using a visual so these are the
JF_m8AhkxuM12,,,  four important purpose for which we use visuals but what kind of guideline you should be
JF_m8AhkxuM12,,,  following when you want to use visuals so power point itself is a kind of visual you
JF_m8AhkxuM12,,,  are using and then i talk about long sentence all that i am just looking at even the word
JF_m8AhkxuM12,,,  which are written in the form of visual because we are just showing to the audience
JF_m8AhkxuM12,,,  so when you use power point particularly dont use long sentence ok instead of using
JF_m8AhkxuM13,8.19,8.59,  long sentence use bullet and take only keywords and phrase use appropriate font size some
JF_m8AhkxuM13,,,  ah place you need to show twenty four font size at least in certain case it will be
JF_m8AhkxuM13,,,  twenty eight title sometimes are even about twenty eight thirty six ok transitional headline
JF_m8AhkxuM13,,,  are between twenty eight thirty two but twelve fourteen they are ok for reading but not in
JF_m8AhkxuM13,,,  term of showing them on power point especially when the audience are likely to be larger
JF_m8AhkxuM13,,,  bigger and then they are likely to sit at the at end so you need to check whether they
JF_m8AhkxuM14,9.04,9.39,  will be able to see the font size so you need to go to the venue and identify how big is
JF_m8AhkxuM14,,,  that and how can they easily look at your presentation and see even from the last row
JF_m8AhkxuM14,,,  the next thing is appropriate color so suppose you are ah going to show them something in
JF_m8AhkxuM14,,,  day light ok and then you are just ah using light color ok yellow light yellow and then
JF_m8AhkxuM14,,,  light pink on the background so they will not be able to see you need to use for instant
JF_m8AhkxuM14,,,  dark blue and yellow in term of font so they will be see the difference so it should be
JF_m8AhkxuM15,9.45,10.2,  contrastive when you are showing it in daylight ok
JF_m8AhkxuM15,,,  so keep appropriate color so that they are able to see the font clearly and when you
JF_m8AhkxuM15,,,  use slide in power pint spell check every slide any spelling mistake that go in the
JF_m8AhkxuM15,,,  power point is owned by you you can not say that your friend or secretary or student typed
JF_m8AhkxuM15,,,  and make that error in fact now a day a you type so good software will underline
JF_m8AhkxuM15,,,  the spelling mistake and then you can correct it even when you type it so do not show any
JF_m8AhkxuM16,10.25,11.02,  slide any visual with spelling mistake check visibility even by going towards the end and
JF_m8AhkxuM16,,,  then identifying the length of the room when you show the visual ok even if it is power
JF_m8AhkxuM16,,,  point speak to the audience dont look at the visual and then talk ok dont do that so speck
JF_m8AhkxuM16,,,  to the audience stop talking when making adjustment to the equipment so sometimes visuals are
JF_m8AhkxuM16,,,  shown in core over head projector so you take one and put another one sometimes even power
JF_m8AhkxuM16,,,  point sometimes you have to do something to move it so when you are doing it dont talk
JF_m8AhkxuM17,11.09,11.43,  dont look at ah visual and talk all the time look at the audience and try to talk
JF_m8AhkxuM17,,,  the other important thing is one let u say you are showing a visual either you are displaying
JF_m8AhkxuM17,,,  it or you are putting it on the o h p and then they are able to see that now you are
JF_m8AhkxuM17,,,  discussing you are put the picture or map or something and then the audience are looking
JF_m8AhkxuM17,,,  at it now once you have made a point and the visual is in term of connection is not to
JF_m8AhkxuM17,,,  be shown any more just remove it and change the visual a the topic change do not leave
JF_m8AhkxuM18,11.5,12.18,  it for a long time because it loses it 's relevant and audience will also lose interest in your
JF_m8AhkxuM18,,,  talk because they will just look at the visual and they will feel that you are just still
JF_m8AhkxuM18,,,  continuing with the same ah thought in term of visuals but in term of verbal you have
JF_m8AhkxuM18,,,  moved to something else so do not confuse them and they will ah feel
JF_m8AhkxuM18,,,  the monotony do not leave visual slide too long so even if you can not change it dont
JF_m8AhkxuM18,,,  just leave it so close it keep it away and then continue with your talk so the audience
JF_m8AhkxuM19,12.24,12.59,  attention is focus towards your speech not on the visual and if you are going to use
JF_m8AhkxuM19,,,  power point they or any kind of visual to move one after another who will do that you
JF_m8AhkxuM19,,,  are doing it somebody will do ah who is going to display that will you do that or somebody
JF_m8AhkxuM19,,,  will keep changing it so identify who is going to do that even sometimes you can show video
JF_m8AhkxuM19,,,  that is also part of visuals so pictorial representation of something animated version
JF_m8AhkxuM19,,,  but are you taking somebody help or are you going to do that in case you have to do
JF_m8AhkxuM20,13.04,13.35,  plan how you are going to do do not waste the audience time ok and minimize this time
JF_m8AhkxuM20,,,  taken for adjustment and all that when you use other supporting material in
JF_m8AhkxuM20,,,  the form of visuals ask this question are they visible in the back row you can even
JF_m8AhkxuM20,,,  ask them if it is not visible if you can take it out and circulate that is also fine ok
JF_m8AhkxuM20,,,  are you can tell them to come to the front or you need to enlarge the size if possible
JF_m8AhkxuM20,,,  also ask whether it is relevant your presentation a i said showing ah thing which are attractive
JF_m8AhkxuM21,13.44,14.15,  but not relevant a nothing to do with your presentation you will also lose effectiveness
JF_m8AhkxuM21,,,  in term of giving a presentation ask the question whether the supporting material
JF_m8AhkxuM21,,,  are short so they do not distract the audience too much from the oral portion of the presentation
JF_m8AhkxuM21,,,  if the ah visual part is longer so audience are likely to get distracted ask again whether
JF_m8AhkxuM21,,,  it is well timed in relation to your presentation is it coming appropriately at the right moment
JF_m8AhkxuM21,,,  or it is coming wrongly so that you need to ah ensured now watch out
JF_m8AhkxuM22,14.25,15,  avoid complicated derivation look at the one that i am showing you nobody i i dont know
JF_m8AhkxuM22,,,  even a math teacher or somebody who is so good in ah theorem and all that we will be
JF_m8AhkxuM22,,,  able to just take a quick look and understand what is the purpose of showing this visuals
JF_m8AhkxuM22,,,  should not make the audience use a microscope and check or use detective work and identify
JF_m8AhkxuM22,,,  what is this and then dont do this thing visuals are just correlating they are just adding
JF_m8AhkxuM22,,,  so dont confuse dont distract dont make it a complicated one such a this by using a
JF_m8AhkxuM23,15.07,15.39,  derivation this is a wrong way to use visual and when you do that there are certain thing
JF_m8AhkxuM23,,,  you need to watch out for standing in a position where you obscure the screen especially standing
JF_m8AhkxuM23,,,  before the ah ah projector and the screen and then your shadow false and audience could
JF_m8AhkxuM23,,,  not see and then they tell you could you please move could you please move so that again will
JF_m8AhkxuM23,,,  be a distractive one and then you showed some picture and then you are lost in the picture
JF_m8AhkxuM23,,,  and you completely got digressed so getting lost in digression is something that you
JF_m8AhkxuM24,15.45,16.15,  should watch out for moving about too much so visual is here so
JF_m8AhkxuM24,,,  you keep coming this side going this side that is also an unnecessary distraction so
JF_m8AhkxuM24,,,  when you do this keep an eye on the audience body language are they feeling restless are
JF_m8AhkxuM24,,,  they so involved immersed in what you are showing so depending on the their body language
JF_m8AhkxuM24,,,  you can decide whether you want to show it longer whether you want to continue with that
JF_m8AhkxuM24,,,  or you should change your strategy is it the time to stop and tell them a joke so that
JF_m8AhkxuM25,16.22,16.56,  they come back or is it the time to show them additional visuals because they are more interested
JF_m8AhkxuM25,,,  in that so keep an eye on the audience body language which will tell you whether they
JF_m8AhkxuM25,,,  are really trusted your visuals or they are getting disinterested
JF_m8AhkxuM25,,,  now towards the end that is after using learning how to use all these ah visuals keep in mind
JF_m8AhkxuM25,,,  some presentation practicality especially if you are a very un matured inexperienced
JF_m8AhkxuM25,,,  presenter and if you are going and giving the presentation somewhere abroad in a different
JF_m8AhkxuM26,17.03,17.51,  place within india in a conference in a seminar ok you been invited and you are going and
JF_m8AhkxuM26,,,  giving a presentation and you are using a power point ok try to send that file in advance
JF_m8AhkxuM26,,,  ok e mail the file in advance if if the file is too large at least convert that so in the
JF_m8AhkxuM26,,,  form of p d f and then again you can send it so you can use any method but then try
JF_m8AhkxuM26,,,  to send it that dont just rest and then relax and think that oh i have now sent the file
JF_m8AhkxuM26,,,  so i dont have to carry anything with me that is a risky proposition because you should
JF_m8AhkxuM27,17.58,18.35,  ensure first of all whether it a reach properly but there is a possibility that ah it dint
JF_m8AhkxuM27,,,  reach them some virus wa there on the computer so the e mail got lost so e mail could not
JF_m8AhkxuM27,,,  be retract the file could not open any issue can happen so this is just a stand by but
JF_m8AhkxuM27,,,  you should keep a hard copy copy in the form of transparency if possible and you should
JF_m8AhkxuM27,,,  also if possible keep your own ah ah p p t in a pen drive if possible keep that in a
JF_m8AhkxuM27,,,  disk if it is a long one get it return in the d v d or copy it again in the pen drive
JF_m8AhkxuM28,18.41,19.15,  in some case if you want specific font and some medium when you take it to another computer
JF_m8AhkxuM28,,,  it may not be using the same font because the version may be different and it may be
JF_m8AhkxuM28,,,  the operating system may be different so you need to have some compatibility so it 's better
JF_m8AhkxuM28,,,  that you carry it with you and then send something in advance just a ah [ sa/stand ] stand by and
JF_m8AhkxuM28,,,  when you reach the venue go experience a venue and then check whether it is working on the
JF_m8AhkxuM28,,,  computer before the audience would come ok get some time go there ah ten fifteen minute
JF_m8AhkxuM29,19.21,19.58,  before check it and whichever laptop or computer you are going to use and the l c d projector
JF_m8AhkxuM29,,,  that you are going to use check whether it is getting connected and check the entire
JF_m8AhkxuM29,,,  presentation whether it is flowing freely smoothly without any ah kick up ok without
JF_m8AhkxuM29,,,  any hindrance this mean you take a quick rehearsal even before others come in the computer
JF_m8AhkxuM29,,,  that is meant for your presentation now if you ensure this you will also be very confident
JF_m8AhkxuM29,,,  when you are going to give the presentation how will you organize your presentation so
JF_m8AhkxuM30,20.04,20.41,  some quick tip on organizing strategy for your presentation one way is to use the chronological
JF_m8AhkxuM30,,,  method that is starting from history so seventeen century this happen eighteen century this
JF_m8AhkxuM30,,,  happen nineteen century this happen twentieth century and correctly this is what i am anticipating
JF_m8AhkxuM30,,,  and twenty first century this is likely to happen chronological or you can simply say
JF_m8AhkxuM30,,,  so ah certain aspect of how something will behave in a week so it happens on monday this
JF_m8AhkxuM30,,,  way tuesday like this wednesday like this so and you can give chronological in term
JF_m8AhkxuM31,20.47,21.19,  of history in term of date the first thing come first you can also use problem caused
JF_m8AhkxuM31,,,  solution method so this mean you want to say that people are so much affected by the
JF_m8AhkxuM31,,,  problem of pollution now what cause pollution and where it is
JF_m8AhkxuM31,,,  causing so you can say that air pollution water pollution so there are so many other
JF_m8AhkxuM31,,,  type of pollution but you can say i am restricting my talk to these two type of pollution what
JF_m8AhkxuM31,,,  are the agent which cause pollution so that is cause and what are the solution that you
JF_m8AhkxuM32,21.26,22.03,  can give so problem pollution what is causing it and what could be the solution you can
JF_m8AhkxuM32,,,  also use this pro and con so for and against advantage disadvantage merit 's demerit 's
JF_m8AhkxuM32,,,  good point bad point so this method is also nice especially if you want to show contrast
JF_m8AhkxuM32,,,  compare two thing and then make the audience understand which one is better than the other
JF_m8AhkxuM32,,,  the other simple method which i said at the beginning of ah the presentation lecture the
JF_m8AhkxuM32,,,  sequential method one two three so i am going to talk about four important issue firstly
JF_m8AhkxuM33,22.11,22.49,  or first in four most secondly thirdly and finally to conclude or even fourthly and then
JF_m8AhkxuM33,,,  you conclude so the sequential model so these are the conventionally used one that help
JF_m8AhkxuM33,,,  the audience to understand that you are able to deliver it in a coherent manner but remember
JF_m8AhkxuM33,,,  to give that effective presentation that will get you that standing ovation you need to
JF_m8AhkxuM33,,,  practice practice practice the more you practice the more effective you will become the more
JF_m8AhkxuM33,,,  confident you will deliver in the content the more effective your body language will
JF_m8AhkxuM34,22.54,23.3,  also become now before i conclude this module let me give
JF_m8AhkxuM34,,,  you some final tip over all tip on presentation skill a such a you become a professional
JF_m8AhkxuM34,,,  a you become an expert speaker try to use topic from your own experience initially
JF_m8AhkxuM34,,,  prepare topic which are from ah so many book and material which are readily available
JF_m8AhkxuM34,,,  for example internet is it a bane or boom technology is it a bane or boom so modern
JF_m8AhkxuM34,,,  invention talk about computer and so on so readymade topic are available so you can
JF_m8AhkxuM35,23.36,24.09,  memorize that and then give small talk but a you become a professional and then instead
JF_m8AhkxuM35,,,  of waiting for people to give you topic you try to use topic from your own experience
JF_m8AhkxuM35,,,  you volunteer and you tell them i have walked on this topic this area which many people
JF_m8AhkxuM35,,,  are not familiar with and i would like to give a lecture small talk on this topic and
JF_m8AhkxuM35,,,  when you do that you also try to develop narrative skill how do you develop narrative skill
JF_m8AhkxuM35,,,  it 's just like telling a story and try to in fact tell story to your friend to your
JF_m8AhkxuM36,24.16,24.49,  colleague to your family member and that will enhance your narrative skill
JF_m8AhkxuM36,,,  so you would plan what should be said at the begging middle and end if there is a suspense
JF_m8AhkxuM36,,,  story you know when to break the suspense how to build it so that is narrative skill
JF_m8AhkxuM36,,,  so try to develop that the art of telling somebody something reporting in the form of
JF_m8AhkxuM36,,,  telling a story whenever you get a chance ensure that you will always give a talk only
JF_m8AhkxuM36,,,  if you have an objective never speck without the purpose ok do not give useless meaningless
JF_m8AhkxuM37,24.57,25.33,  talk that is the easiest way to become unpopular and the audience will start hating you running
JF_m8AhkxuM37,,,  away from you speak only with a purpose and when you build up and argument in your talk
JF_m8AhkxuM37,,,  so when your arguing in favor against something use interesting example ok so the more interesting
JF_m8AhkxuM37,,,  it will be in the better audience will able to remember them connect them with personal
JF_m8AhkxuM37,,,  anecdote tell how you can relate it to you what happens in your personal life how can
JF_m8AhkxuM37,,,  you relate to this one the way you relate many other people will be able to relate to
JF_m8AhkxuM38,25.38,26.21,  your personal experience and then they will be able to understand that better use funny
JF_m8AhkxuM38,,,  fact ok in fact what i imply by this is use humor occasional humor occasional sense of
JF_m8AhkxuM38,,,  humor will make the audience break the monotony in fact even in interview ok if you can use
JF_m8AhkxuM38,,,  if you can given intelligent joke and if you can make the people in the interview panel
JF_m8AhkxuM38,,,  laugh ok so you can almost be sure that you are getting the job because that will make
JF_m8AhkxuM38,,,  them look at an another aspect of you which generally they have ignored and same thing
JF_m8AhkxuM39,26.28,27.01,  with presentation also when you use humor so they thought that you are a very serious
JF_m8AhkxuM39,,,  speaker your are a very ah ah serious scientist and then a researcher you are giving very
JF_m8AhkxuM39,,,  serious idea but suddenly you go off track slightly give a funny fact funny anecdote
JF_m8AhkxuM39,,,  so that will make people relate to you in a better manner ok having said this last two
JF_m8AhkxuM39,,,  point in term of overall communication you need to communicate clearly if there is no
JF_m8AhkxuM39,,,  mike and then your confronted in a situation you have to give it talk project your voice
JF_m8AhkxuM40,27.07,27.45,  which mean you need to speak a little more loudly a if you are acting before them a
JF_m8AhkxuM40,,,  if you are on a stage and then those day if you remember there were no microphone
JF_m8AhkxuM40,,,  so the actor have to shout ok so imagine that you have to speak more loudly then normal
JF_m8AhkxuM40,,,  but it will be un usual at first but your audience wont notice because in fact raising
JF_m8AhkxuM40,,,  your voice is something that will make the audience focus to you ok there are speaker
JF_m8AhkxuM40,,,  who raise their voice speak so loud so that they even ensure that nobody in the audience
JF_m8AhkxuM41,27.52,28.22,  can sleep it is so loud they they can not sleep in that loud noise ok
JF_m8AhkxuM41,,,  but the point i am make is it should be loud enough so they are able to hear it clearly
JF_m8AhkxuM41,,,  but if you speak softly so they will notice that why ah this person is specking so soft
JF_m8AhkxuM41,,,  i am not able to hear only to the people who are sitting in the first row it is audible
JF_m8AhkxuM41,,,  then they become restless and then they get distracted and they thing which you do not
JF_m8AhkxuM41,,,  want them to do communicating clearly on the one hand but communicating effectively overall
JF_m8AhkxuM42,28.32,29.11,  is the most important objective of delivering ah public speech or oral presentation remember
JF_m8AhkxuM42,,,  there is no point in giving a presentation that the audience can not understand so if
JF_m8AhkxuM42,,,  it go above their height or if it is too low or you are making it complicated a you
JF_m8AhkxuM42,,,  very well know there are some people who use very complex ah vocabulary so that even a
JF_m8AhkxuM42,,,  simple idea becomes very difficult for you to understand but there are others that i
JF_m8AhkxuM42,,,  want you to follow who even take a very complex idea difficult subject but they use simple
JF_m8AhkxuM43,29.19,29.58,  thought simple expression and then they find simple way of convincing you to understand
JF_m8AhkxuM43,,,  that and that is the method you should follow so that the audience can understand you fully
JF_m8AhkxuM43,,,  and effectively ok so if you can do this and keep this in mind
JF_m8AhkxuM43,,,  you will definitely become that popular speaker and finally when you give a talk enjoy yourself
JF_m8AhkxuM43,,,  great psychologist like ibrahim maslow they say that in our life we have opportunity
JF_m8AhkxuM43,,,  for peak experience high tent experience one of the high tent peak experience that
JF_m8AhkxuM44,30.09,30.44,  you can get is the speech that you deliver before audience the larger the number the
JF_m8AhkxuM44,,,  greater your peak experience so when you experience that peak form of ah your performance enjoy
JF_m8AhkxuM44,,,  yourself when you are enjoy yourself giving the talk the audience will also enjoy your
JF_m8AhkxuM44,,,  performance and then be creative i have given you lot of suggestion but then try to break
JF_m8AhkxuM44,,,  away even if you think that you can do better than what i have said ok and if somebody tell
JF_m8AhkxuM44,,,  you this is the way it should be done but if you think creatively and if you feel that
JF_m8AhkxuM45,30.49,31.22,  if it can be done this way it is still better do that be creative and when you slowly develop
JF_m8AhkxuM45,,,  yourself in term of ah oral presentation and public speech develop your own style the
JF_m8AhkxuM45,,,  your own style of narrating thing your own style of telling joke your own style of presentation
JF_m8AhkxuM45,,,  your own style of preparing slide so make your style and then what will have is soon
JF_m8AhkxuM45,,,  you will have your own fan people will like your own unique style initially you will be
JF_m8AhkxuM45,,,  bit embarrass bit shy thinking that can i really do this but just do what come naturally
JF_m8AhkxuM46,31.29,32.04,  into you so that may be your real inner talent and talk out that potential and you will have
JF_m8AhkxuM46,,,  your own fan and you will get that standing ovation that i been telling you to visualize
JF_m8AhkxuM46,,,  right from the beginning now the last concluding thought after talking to you so much about
JF_m8AhkxuM46,,,  presentation skill i have given you enough input but ah look at the famous quote from
JF_m8AhkxuM46,,,  this ah martial art super star ah bruce lee he say that knowing is not enough so now
JF_m8AhkxuM46,,,  you know everything about public speaking but that knowing is not enough we must apply
JF_m8AhkxuM47,32.14,32.51,  you must use it in your presentation willing is not enough ok your willing to do this you
JF_m8AhkxuM47,,,  wish to do this that is not enough we must do what doe it mean suppose you dont know
JF_m8AhkxuM47,,,  how to swim you go to the library and read ton of book thousand of book on swimming
JF_m8AhkxuM47,,,  you have read but i ask you did you ever go to the swimming
JF_m8AhkxuM47,,,  fool you say no did you ever jumped in to the water in the swimming fool you say no
JF_m8AhkxuM47,,,  do you understand you must do it reading hundred of book on swimming will not help you you
JF_m8AhkxuM48,32.59,33.36,  have read twenty hundred book on how to ride a bicycle but you are afraid of sitting on
JF_m8AhkxuM48,,,  the seat and then ah holding the handle bar so how will you learn cycling the same thing
JF_m8AhkxuM48,,,  go with public speaking speaking any communication related issue it 's an art you need to develop
JF_m8AhkxuM48,,,  it you will develop it only by practice ah and any amount of knowledge that i give you
JF_m8AhkxuM48,,,  is not going to be enough a i said at the beginning of ah the lecture the purpose of
JF_m8AhkxuM48,,,  ah these video the purpose of ah my lecture particularly is not to ah help you just get
JF_m8AhkxuM50,33.43,34.39,  a certificate and display to people just do all this assignment but beyond this certificate
JF_m8AhkxuM50,,,  and assignment have you learnt something from this and learning in that sense ha it done
JF_m8AhkxuM50,,,  something to you your thinking your believe change in your behavior have you taken one
JF_m8AhkxuM50,,,  step ok and then have you followed it up by taking more step that is what is meant by
JF_m8AhkxuM50,,,  willing is not enough we must do do it practice it become very trained professional public
JF_m8AhkxuM50,,,  speaker do not have any fear for oral presentation embrace any chance jump at any chance use

ivaja7-MprQ1,0,0.11,  hi everyone kevin here today i want to
ivaja7-MprQ1,,,  show you how you can use
ivaja7-MprQ1,,,  presenter view in microsoft powerpoint
ivaja7-MprQ1,,,  when you 're presenting in
ivaja7-MprQ1,,,  microsoft team what is presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ1,,,  well there are three
ivaja7-MprQ2,0.12,0.21,  advantage of using presenter view the
ivaja7-MprQ2,,,  first one is
ivaja7-MprQ2,,,  you get note alongside your slide so
ivaja7-MprQ2,,,  let 's say that you have a big
ivaja7-MprQ2,,,  presentation coming up at work
ivaja7-MprQ2,,,  or maybe you 're a teacher presenting to
ivaja7-MprQ3,0.23,0.31,  your class and you want to make sure
ivaja7-MprQ3,,,  that you hit certain point
ivaja7-MprQ3,,,  with the note you can make sure you
ivaja7-MprQ3,,,  cover all the point that you want to
ivaja7-MprQ3,,,  cover
ivaja7-MprQ3,,,  on that slide also you see what 's coming
ivaja7-MprQ4,0.34,0.43,  up next in your slide presentation
ivaja7-MprQ4,,,  i do n't know how many presentation i 've
ivaja7-MprQ4,,,  been in where the presenter ha been
ivaja7-MprQ4,,,  flustered by the next slide that appears
ivaja7-MprQ4,,,  you do n't have to let that happen
ivaja7-MprQ4,,,  anymore and lastly
ivaja7-MprQ5,0.45,0.54,  with presenter view you get access to a
ivaja7-MprQ5,,,  whole bunch of annotation tool
ivaja7-MprQ5,,,  for instance you could pull up a pen you
ivaja7-MprQ5,,,  could pull up a highlighter a laser
ivaja7-MprQ5,,,  pointer
ivaja7-MprQ5,,,  to make your presentation more dynamic
ivaja7-MprQ6,0.57,1.05,  now i 'm going to show you how to use
ivaja7-MprQ6,,,  presenter view even if you just have
ivaja7-MprQ6,,,  a single monitor it 's really easy to
ivaja7-MprQ6,,,  pull up this should be a really quick
ivaja7-MprQ6,,,  tutorial
ivaja7-MprQ6,,,  and why do n't we jump on the pc and i 'll
ivaja7-MprQ7,1.08,1.16,  show you how to do it
ivaja7-MprQ7,,,  here i am on my pc and i have microsoft
ivaja7-MprQ7,,,  team
ivaja7-MprQ7,,,  open coming up later today i have an
ivaja7-MprQ7,,,  extremely
ivaja7-MprQ7,,,  important meeting where i 'm going to be
ivaja7-MprQ8,1.18,1.28,  pitching the kevin cookie company to
ivaja7-MprQ8,,,  investor i 'm trying to raise some fund
ivaja7-MprQ8,,,  for the kevin cookie company so we could
ivaja7-MprQ8,,,  expand our location
ivaja7-MprQ8,,,  now anytime i talk to investor i get
ivaja7-MprQ8,,,  really nervous because our
ivaja7-MprQ9,1.29,1.38,  company really depends on being able to
ivaja7-MprQ9,,,  raise these fund
ivaja7-MprQ9,,,  now when i 'm presenting being able to
ivaja7-MprQ9,,,  see note being able to see what slide
ivaja7-MprQ9,,,  are coming up next
ivaja7-MprQ9,,,  that 'll really help me deliver a more
ivaja7-MprQ10,1.4,1.49,  confident presentation
ivaja7-MprQ10,,,  and if i could use annotation tool a
ivaja7-MprQ10,,,  well i think it 'll also make it a more
ivaja7-MprQ10,,,  dynamic presentation so presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ10,,,  will be very very helpful here
ivaja7-MprQ10,,,  i 'm going to go ahead and let me click
ivaja7-MprQ11,1.51,1.59,  on this meeting and i 'm going to test it
ivaja7-MprQ11,,,  out to make sure
ivaja7-MprQ11,,,  i could get into presenter view and to
ivaja7-MprQ11,,,  make sure everything work a i expect
ivaja7-MprQ11,,,  it to
ivaja7-MprQ11,,,  emily on my team ha volunteered to help
ivaja7-MprQ12,2.01,2.1,  me test it
ivaja7-MprQ12,,,  this way you 'll be able to see what my
ivaja7-MprQ12,,,  screen look like a the presenter and
ivaja7-MprQ12,,,  you 'll also be able to see what it look
ivaja7-MprQ12,,,  like from an attendee 's perspective
ivaja7-MprQ12,,,  using emily let me go ahead and join
ivaja7-MprQ13,2.12,2.22,  this meeting
ivaja7-MprQ13,,,  i 've now joined the meeting and i can
ivaja7-MprQ13,,,  see that emily is already in the meeting
ivaja7-MprQ13,,,  hey emily how 's it going doing great
ivaja7-MprQ13,,,  kevin how are you
ivaja7-MprQ13,,,  yes once again the kevin youtube channel
ivaja7-MprQ14,2.24,2.34,  is smaller than you 'd expect
ivaja7-MprQ14,,,  it 's only me so here within the
ivaja7-MprQ14,,,  microsoft team meeting to be able to
ivaja7-MprQ14,,,  use presenter view well first off i need
ivaja7-MprQ14,,,  to share
ivaja7-MprQ14,,,  or present some content so up here i
ivaja7-MprQ15,2.36,2.46,  have all of my meeting control and
ivaja7-MprQ15,,,  the one that i 'm interested in is the
ivaja7-MprQ15,,,  one where i could open my share tray so
ivaja7-MprQ15,,,  let me go ahead and open that up
ivaja7-MprQ15,,,  now you see all these different item
ivaja7-MprQ15,,,  that i could share
ivaja7-MprQ16,2.47,2.55,  now there are three different way you
ivaja7-MprQ16,,,  could share a powerpoint presentation
ivaja7-MprQ16,,,  but only one of them
ivaja7-MprQ16,,,  will bring up the presenter view so
ivaja7-MprQ16,,,  choose wisely
ivaja7-MprQ16,,,  over here on the left hand side i could
ivaja7-MprQ17,2.57,3.07,  simply share my entire desktop
ivaja7-MprQ17,,,  however when i share my entire desktop
ivaja7-MprQ17,,,  if i shift into presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ17,,,  my attendee will also see that i 'm in
ivaja7-MprQ17,,,  presenter view and that 's not what i
ivaja7-MprQ17,,,  want
ivaja7-MprQ18,3.08,3.17,  i want to see presenter view and i want
ivaja7-MprQ18,,,  my attendee to just see the slide
ivaja7-MprQ18,,,  so if you chose desktop this is not the
ivaja7-MprQ18,,,  right path
ivaja7-MprQ18,,,  there 's also another option on the right
ivaja7-MprQ18,,,  hand side where you can upload a
ivaja7-MprQ19,3.19,3.27,  powerpoint presentation
ivaja7-MprQ19,,,  to microsoft team and you could present
ivaja7-MprQ19,,,  that way
ivaja7-MprQ19,,,  now that get you part of the way there
ivaja7-MprQ19,,,  because your attendee will just see the
ivaja7-MprQ19,,,  slide
ivaja7-MprQ20,3.28,3.35,  you 'll see the slide and you 'll also be
ivaja7-MprQ20,,,  able to pull up note alongside your
ivaja7-MprQ20,,,  slide
ivaja7-MprQ20,,,  however the note wo n't be via presenter
ivaja7-MprQ20,,,  view
ivaja7-MprQ20,,,  the only way that we could show and see
ivaja7-MprQ21,3.37,3.46,  presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ21,,,  is if we go ahead and share the
ivaja7-MprQ21,,,  powerpoint presentation window
ivaja7-MprQ21,,,  so this is the right path if we want to
ivaja7-MprQ21,,,  use presenter view so let 's go ahead and
ivaja7-MprQ21,,,  share the powerpoint presentation window
ivaja7-MprQ22,3.49,4,  this brings up a powerpoint presentation
ivaja7-MprQ22,,,  and right now i 'm sharing the entire
ivaja7-MprQ22,,,  window if we look over at
ivaja7-MprQ22,,,  emily 's screen what you 'll see is right
ivaja7-MprQ22,,,  now she see everything that i see so
ivaja7-MprQ22,,,  she see all the powerpoint chrome
ivaja7-MprQ23,4.02,4.12,  she see the slide sorter on the left
ivaja7-MprQ23,,,  hand side and then she see the slide in
ivaja7-MprQ23,,,  the center of
ivaja7-MprQ23,,,  the screen we want to get it into
ivaja7-MprQ23,,,  presenter mode and to do that
ivaja7-MprQ23,,,  first off we have to kick off the
ivaja7-MprQ24,4.14,4.22,  presentation there are a few different
ivaja7-MprQ24,,,  way we could do that
ivaja7-MprQ24,,,  up here on the ribbon if we click into
ivaja7-MprQ24,,,  slideshow you can start a presentation
ivaja7-MprQ24,,,  from the beginning
ivaja7-MprQ24,,,  or you could press the f5 key a the
ivaja7-MprQ25,4.24,4.34,  shortcut you could also start from the
ivaja7-MprQ25,,,  current slide the shortcut for that
ivaja7-MprQ25,,,  is shift and f5 and then also down here
ivaja7-MprQ25,,,  in the bottom right hand corner you
ivaja7-MprQ25,,,  could also click on this
ivaja7-MprQ25,,,  icon to start the presentation so let 's
ivaja7-MprQ26,4.36,4.47,  go ahead i 'm going to press f5 i 'm a big
ivaja7-MprQ26,,,  fan of shortcut key it make life
ivaja7-MprQ26,,,  easier and quicker so let 's go ahead and
ivaja7-MprQ26,,,  kick off this presentation
ivaja7-MprQ26,,,  so this drop me on the first slide of
ivaja7-MprQ26,,,  the presentation and right now if we
ivaja7-MprQ27,4.48,4.58,  look at emily
ivaja7-MprQ27,,,  she see exactly what i see we 're in
ivaja7-MprQ27,,,  just the standard presentation mode
ivaja7-MprQ27,,,  now i want to bring up presenter view on
ivaja7-MprQ27,,,  my screen so
ivaja7-MprQ27,,,  one way to do that is here on the slide
ivaja7-MprQ28,5,5.09,  i 'm going to right click with my mouse
ivaja7-MprQ28,,,  and then i see an option that say show
ivaja7-MprQ28,,,  presenter view i 'm going to go ahead and
ivaja7-MprQ28,,,  click on that
ivaja7-MprQ28,,,  now you 'll see on my screen this pull
ivaja7-MprQ28,,,  up presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ29,5.1,5.2,  and right here in the middle of
ivaja7-MprQ29,,,  presenter view i see the slide that
ivaja7-MprQ29,,,  currently all of my attendee can see
ivaja7-MprQ29,,,  it 's the largest one and probably the
ivaja7-MprQ29,,,  most important one because this is
ivaja7-MprQ29,,,  what 's being broadcast out to my
ivaja7-MprQ30,5.21,5.3,  attendee
ivaja7-MprQ30,,,  over on the right hand side i see the
ivaja7-MprQ30,,,  next slide that 's coming up so this way
ivaja7-MprQ30,,,  i wo n't be caught off guard
ivaja7-MprQ30,,,  by the content that 's coming up next
ivaja7-MprQ30,,,  once again it 's surprising to see how
ivaja7-MprQ31,5.32,5.4,  many people are thrown off by what 's
ivaja7-MprQ31,,,  coming up next
ivaja7-MprQ31,,,  probably ha to do with collaborating
ivaja7-MprQ31,,,  with other people on slide someone
ivaja7-MprQ31,,,  insert a slide and you forgot that it
ivaja7-MprQ31,,,  wa there down here in the bottom right
ivaja7-MprQ32,5.42,5.5,  hand corner
ivaja7-MprQ32,,,  this is where i see all of my slide
ivaja7-MprQ32,,,  note so this way a i 'm presenting this
ivaja7-MprQ32,,,  slide i 'll remember here in this case
ivaja7-MprQ32,,,  that i wanted to share an example of a
ivaja7-MprQ32,,,  co
ivaja7-MprQ33,5.51,6.01,  who used this during her presentation
ivaja7-MprQ33,,,  when i speak to this slide i could bring
ivaja7-MprQ33,,,  up that point
ivaja7-MprQ33,,,  now along with seeing my note down here
ivaja7-MprQ33,,,  i have all of my different tool that i
ivaja7-MprQ33,,,  could use while presenting
ivaja7-MprQ34,6.02,6.11,  so i have thing like a pen a laser
ivaja7-MprQ34,,,  pointer i could zoom in i could turn the
ivaja7-MprQ34,,,  screen white or black
ivaja7-MprQ34,,,  i have lot of different tool i could
ivaja7-MprQ34,,,  even turn on subtitle or caption along
ivaja7-MprQ34,,,  with my slide
ivaja7-MprQ35,6.12,6.23,  and then i could advance to the next
ivaja7-MprQ35,,,  slide or return to a previous slide
ivaja7-MprQ35,,,  so i have lot of different tool here
ivaja7-MprQ35,,,  now if we look over at emily 's display
ivaja7-MprQ35,,,  you 'll see in emily 's display that she
ivaja7-MprQ35,,,  continues to only see the slide
ivaja7-MprQ36,6.25,6.34,  so even though amin present her view
ivaja7-MprQ36,,,  emily continues to just see the slide
ivaja7-MprQ36,,,  so this way she doe n't see all my note
ivaja7-MprQ36,,,  she doe n't see all the different tool
ivaja7-MprQ36,,,  that i have
ivaja7-MprQ36,,,  and our view are now separated let me
ivaja7-MprQ37,6.36,6.46,  go ahead and end the slideshow and i
ivaja7-MprQ37,,,  want to show you
ivaja7-MprQ37,,,  one other way to get into presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ37,,,  so you do n't have to first kick it off
ivaja7-MprQ37,,,  into full screen presentation and then
ivaja7-MprQ37,,,  shift it
ivaja7-MprQ38,6.47,7,  instead what we can do is when we 're on
ivaja7-MprQ38,,,  the main view here within powerpoint
ivaja7-MprQ38,,,  if you press the alt key with the f5 key
ivaja7-MprQ38,,,  at the same time that 'll launch u
ivaja7-MprQ38,,,  directly into presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ38,,,  now if you remember when we hovered over
ivaja7-MprQ39,7.02,7.15,  from the beginning the shortcut key wa
ivaja7-MprQ39,,,  f5 all we do is we combine that now with
ivaja7-MprQ39,,,  the alt key
ivaja7-MprQ39,,,  and so let 's press alt f5 when i press
ivaja7-MprQ39,,,  alt f5 this drop u immediately in
ivaja7-MprQ39,,,  the presenter view and once again i 'm
ivaja7-MprQ40,7.17,7.25,  going to pull up emily 's screen and
ivaja7-MprQ40,,,  emily just see the slide that we 're
ivaja7-MprQ40,,,  presenting
ivaja7-MprQ40,,,  and she doe not see the presenter view
ivaja7-MprQ40,,,  now that we 're back in the main
ivaja7-MprQ40,,,  powerpoint view the f5 key ha lot of
ivaja7-MprQ41,7.27,7.35,  different way that you can use it
ivaja7-MprQ41,,,  if you want to just start the
ivaja7-MprQ41,,,  presentation from the first slide or the
ivaja7-MprQ41,,,  very beginning you hit f5
ivaja7-MprQ41,,,  if you want to start from the current
ivaja7-MprQ41,,,  slide you press shift f5
ivaja7-MprQ42,7.37,7.47,  and if you want to drop directly in
ivaja7-MprQ42,,,  presenter view you press alt
ivaja7-MprQ42,,,  f5 so combining f5 with a number of
ivaja7-MprQ42,,,  other key
ivaja7-MprQ42,,,  you have power and control over how you
ivaja7-MprQ42,,,  want to kick off your presentation
ivaja7-MprQ43,7.49,7.57,  now that 's how we get into presenter

rvIfl5Q66T03,,,  structure about presentation aid about
rvIfl5Q66T03,,,  audience about any of the thing that I
rvIfl5Q66T03,,,  talk to you about revive any other
rvIfl5Q66T03,,,  issue that you might have with

rvIfl5Q66T04,,,  knowledge I hope you remember let 's not
rvIfl5Q66T05,1.03,1.35,  speaking of distraction that is good to
rvIfl5Q66T05,,,  know
rvIfl5Q66T05,,,  okay before we move on you guy have any
rvIfl5Q66T05,,,  question from the get about
rvIfl5Q66T05,,,  structural to the last time a lot of
rvIfl5Q66T05,,,  time with maybe you might like to switch
rvIfl5Q66T06,1.39,1.58,  the order of our presentation to tear
rvIfl5Q66T06,,,  presentation to the general public to
rvIfl5Q66T06,,,  tear when the first that supposed to go
rvIfl5Q66T06,,,  are you doing
rvIfl5Q66T06,,,  to what we understand a made people
rvIfl5Q66T06,,,  across each other
rvIfl5Q66T07,1.59,2.28,  and when he changed you need more simple
rvIfl5Q66T07,,,  Oh s cool so our presentation were not
rvIfl5Q66T07,,,  academic become better that way learn
rvIfl5Q66T07,,,  something useful about like how how much
rvIfl5Q66T07,,,  of the content is accessible long
rvIfl5Q66T07,,,  specialist and maybe attachment very
rvIfl5Q66T08,2.31,2.47,  deep with other artist I visit me at
rvIfl5Q66T08,,,  all clear of initiative next five side
rvIfl5Q66T08,,,  there
rvIfl5Q66T08,,,  that 's right
rvIfl5Q66T08,,,  I see I see where the idea is coming
rvIfl5Q66T08,,,  from I do that 's exactly what I do n't
rvIfl5Q66T09,2.49,3.03,  want you guy to do oh I want a barrier
rvIfl5Q66T09,,,  presentation with your audience very
rvIfl5Q66T09,,,  specifically in mind I do n't want you to
rvIfl5Q66T09,,,  take the presentation you already have
rvIfl5Q66T09,,,  let 's prepare for academic and cut it I
rvIfl5Q66T09,,,  want you to think completely from the
rvIfl5Q66T010,3.07,3.19,  scratch about talking about what you do
rvIfl5Q66T010,,,  to people who do n't know what you have
rvIfl5Q66T010,,,  there wa kind of the idea i invisible
rvIfl5Q66T010,,,  because remember on the last lecture and
rvIfl5Q66T010,,,  I can totally see where you 're coming
rvIfl5Q66T010,,,  from because first of all it make you
rvIfl5Q66T011,3.22,3.35,  work blessed because you 've never done
rvIfl5Q66T011,,,  you know how would be hurt you and the
rvIfl5Q66T011,,,  second thing is in c20 good sequence the
rvIfl5Q66T011,,,  thing is about all the insurgent and
rvIfl5Q66T011,,,  transcends and why I wa talking so much
rvIfl5Q66T011,,,  about think who exactly you 're talking
rvIfl5Q66T012,3.38,3.51,  to when you 're preparing the
rvIfl5Q66T012,,,  presentation I 'm hoping even your
rvIfl5Q66T012,,,  structure when you talk to academic
rvIfl5Q66T012,,,  person on academic I 'm thinking your
rvIfl5Q66T012,,,  emphasis will hopefully be completely
rvIfl5Q66T012,,,  different maybe even your main point
rvIfl5Q66T013,3.53,4.05,  only different because like for instance
rvIfl5Q66T013,,,  when we talk about I 'm thinking about
rvIfl5Q66T013,,,  his research and I 'm thinking if she
rvIfl5Q66T013,,,  talk to people who have no idea what
rvIfl5Q66T013,,,  she 's doing she 's going to have to
rvIfl5Q66T013,,,  normally cut it in half word one third
rvIfl5Q66T014,4.08,4.2,  or fifth or powder she 's going to change
rvIfl5Q66T014,,,  Cavallari she 's going to have to change
rvIfl5Q66T014,,,  the way she talk about stuff because
rvIfl5Q66T014,,,  remember what we see when we look up is
rvIfl5Q66T014,,,  completely something different than they
rvIfl5Q66T014,,,  see it completely we call it different
rvIfl5Q66T015,4.22,4.37,  name because we do n't know I say you
rvIfl5Q66T015,,,  are just like we 're talking no longer it
rvIfl5Q66T015,,,  right she 's going to have two different
rvIfl5Q66T015,,,  presentation and I 'm hoping that 's
rvIfl5Q66T015,,,  what 's going to happen with you guy too
rvIfl5Q66T015,,,  they usually have to ask yourself kind
rvIfl5Q66T016,4.39,4.52,  of from a different angle now I should
rvIfl5Q66T016,,,  talk about it I 'm how many people who
rvIfl5Q66T016,,,  really do n't know what I 'm talking about
rvIfl5Q66T016,,,  doe that make a little more sense if
rvIfl5Q66T016,,,  I 'm able to like explain why I beg your
rvIfl5Q66T016,,,  life my hope is that having these two
rvIfl5Q66T017,4.57,5.12,  presentation is not oh one thing is
rvIfl5Q66T017,,,  that you need
rvIfl5Q66T017,,,  but also that you husband and that you
rvIfl5Q66T017,,,  can take and use summer so you do n't
rvIfl5Q66T017,,,  have never been easy hopefully you
rvIfl5Q66T017,,,  dueces read up on it that you can then
rvIfl5Q66T018,5.14,5.31,  go maybe take it to you know I I school
rvIfl5Q66T018,,,  area or like for me I work a campground
rvIfl5Q66T018,,,  basically and they have education
rvIfl5Q66T018,,,  program maybe I can take my patient
rvIfl5Q66T018,,,  like service so maybe see that in mind
rvIfl5Q66T018,,,  you 're prepared
rvIfl5Q66T019,5.33,5.47,  not only you 're doing to this class but
rvIfl5Q66T019,,,  how you use it outside the classroom you
rvIfl5Q66T019,,,  or you want to be a guest lecturer and
rvIfl5Q66T019,,,  courtesan community college and you 're
rvIfl5Q66T019,,,  talking to people for just starting or
rvIfl5Q66T019,,,  maybe thinking about graduate school you
rvIfl5Q66T020,5.49,6,  do n't want to scare them but you do what
rvIfl5Q66T020,,,  I presented in a way that 's very
rvIfl5Q66T020,,,  accessible and if the same time very
rvIfl5Q66T020,,,  interesting that 's that 's very good
rvIfl5Q66T020,,,  example you might want to use something
rvIfl5Q66T020,,,  that and that hopefully will be
rvIfl5Q66T021,6.03,6.16,  completely different than something you
rvIfl5Q66T021,,,  will present in your apartment in front
rvIfl5Q66T021,,,  of your pc advisor in front of for a
rvIfl5Q66T021,,,  conference in from your peer so it 's
rvIfl5Q66T021,,,  like I 'm thinking different completely
rvIfl5Q66T021,,,  different different structure may be
rvIfl5Q66T022,6.18,6.29,  differing point different approach we
rvIfl5Q66T022,,,  do n't want to hear this and presentation
rvIfl5Q66T022,,,  place and I 'm letting mention it because
rvIfl5Q66T022,,,  it 's a good way to think about it too a
rvIfl5Q66T022,,,  the bedroom there and how to make those
rvIfl5Q66T022,,,  Lewis my name is preparing a
rvIfl5Q66T023,6.31,6.46,  presentation about a proposal
rvIfl5Q66T023,,,  communication for Community College and
rvIfl5Q66T023,,,  I realize that even communication it 's
rvIfl5Q66T023,,,  something a people or you into this
rvIfl5Q66T023,,,  reputation we use certain word all the
rvIfl5Q66T023,,,  time that are very discipline specific
rvIfl5Q66T024,6.5,7.02,  and I need to cut them all out in
rvIfl5Q66T024,,,  champaign what wa it when I did n't know
rvIfl5Q66T024,,,  what it brilliant I just thought about
rvIfl5Q66T024,,,  this talking to people and communicating
rvIfl5Q66T024,,,  how do you do that and there 's a
rvIfl5Q66T024,,,  childhood fun do n't any other question
rvIfl5Q66T025,7.07,7.22,  shoe please
rvIfl5Q66T025,,,  okay presentation aid few thing I want
rvIfl5Q66T025,,,  to tell you about presentation aid um
rvIfl5Q66T025,,,  we use them of course constantly or we
rvIfl5Q66T025,,,  tend to think about what we think about
rvIfl5Q66T025,,,  presentation aid is PowerPoint I want
rvIfl5Q66T026,7.24,7.38,  you to remember that is not the only
rvIfl5Q66T026,,,  option there are other thing you can do
rvIfl5Q66T026,,,  that include audio visual aid that do
rvIfl5Q66T026,,,  not include power first and foremost
rvIfl5Q66T026,,,  thing that I want you to be prepared
rvIfl5Q66T026,,,  for when you are planning to use a
rvIfl5Q66T027,7.4,7.58,  presentation age is be prepared for not
rvIfl5Q66T027,,,  using it because if you have a
rvIfl5Q66T027,,,  presentation with a PowerPoint then we
rvIfl5Q66T027,,,  like to this PowerPoint so heavily that
rvIfl5Q66T027,,,  if you do n't have it reviewed it brings
rvIfl5Q66T027,,,  something that 's worth the projector
rvIfl5Q66T028,7.59,8.16,  doe n't turn on the switch the cake will
rvIfl5Q66T028,,,  be adapter the map versus the Norma that
rvIfl5Q66T028,,,  so whatever happened you need to be able
rvIfl5Q66T028,,,  to say something besides I 'm and that 's
rvIfl5Q66T028,,,  it and I 'm serious it happens a
rvIfl5Q66T028,,,  unlikely a you think it doe it happens
rvIfl5Q66T029,8.19,8.33,  all the time thing do n't work computer
rvIfl5Q66T029,,,  are match adapter known one adapt
rvIfl5Q66T029,,,  projector two thing have something to
rvIfl5Q66T029,,,  say besides I 'm sorry my friend point
rvIfl5Q66T029,,,  doe n't work and this is something that
rvIfl5Q66T029,,,  strongly encouraged have plan B always
rvIfl5Q66T030,8.39,8.51,  so are you going to sneak attack u and
rvIfl5Q66T030,,,  relentless in a fast
rvIfl5Q66T030,,,  it might a well happen in this class
rvIfl5Q66T030,,,  continue without mine that 's usually
rvIfl5Q66T030,,,  what happens to be honest with you I
rvIfl5Q66T030,,,  teach puppetry and I teach about me
rvIfl5Q66T031,8.54,9.09,  speaking in different room but most
rvIfl5Q66T031,,,  often in wellman and there are tool and
rvIfl5Q66T031,,,  while I try to teach probably and my
rvIfl5Q66T031,,,  opener always one oh nothing of it but
rvIfl5Q66T031,,,  I always tell student be prepared your
rvIfl5Q66T031,,,  random word that are overlooked and
rvIfl5Q66T032,9.11,9.24,  everytime first round and informative
rvIfl5Q66T032,,,  speech at least three people do n't get
rvIfl5Q66T032,,,  hurt originally I do n't know I do n't
rvIfl5Q66T032,,,  know if it aura I would know if it 's
rvIfl5Q66T032,,,  the machinery that already hurting so
rvIfl5Q66T032,,,  many time they kind of just reacts to
rvIfl5Q66T033,9.26,9.39,  okay she 's yelling we work she 's not any
rvIfl5Q66T033,,,  door I do n't know how it work but I
rvIfl5Q66T033,,,  kid you not pitch that work certain
rvIfl5Q66T033,,,  people 's cutback and it doe where
rvIfl5Q66T033,,,  certain people just like the computer
rvIfl5Q66T033,,,  and nothing in it I do n't know why
rvIfl5Q66T034,9.41,9.52,  imagine it just happens so you do n't
rvIfl5Q66T034,,,  want it might just a water with it I 'm
rvIfl5Q66T034,,,  going to do anything we 'll see but no be
rvIfl5Q66T034,,,  prepared for because it really doe
rvIfl5Q66T034,,,  happen and I goodness it 's plenty of
rvIfl5Q66T034,,,  time and if you have this one
rvIfl5Q66T035,9.56,10.09,  opportunity this one conference this one
rvIfl5Q66T035,,,  presentation just one time to do it you
rvIfl5Q66T035,,,  better be prepared to do so whatever you
rvIfl5Q66T035,,,  need is it you need to print your slide
rvIfl5Q66T035,,,  or you need to have an outline or you
rvIfl5Q66T035,,,  need to be able to explain thing and
rvIfl5Q66T036,10.11,10.21,  hopefully you will be able to deliver
rvIfl5Q66T036,,,  your presentation without saying so here
rvIfl5Q66T036,,,  i will show you this thing i 'm not going
rvIfl5Q66T036,,,  to show you which would be really good
rvIfl5Q66T036,,,  will help you but i am from it that 's
rvIfl5Q66T036,,,  not very helpful so try to have it let
rvIfl5Q66T037,10.27,10.44,  me and this also might give everything
rvIfl5Q66T037,,,  for you
rvIfl5Q66T037,,,  team with your attention if you know
rvIfl5Q66T037,,,  that word stop store you still prepared
rvIfl5Q66T037,,,  that is a very good another little
rvIfl5Q66T037,,,  technique to make yourself feel le
rvIfl5Q66T038,10.46,11.04,  anxious because if you know that you 're
rvIfl5Q66T038,,,  prepared even if thing do n't work that
rvIfl5Q66T038,,,  make you feel that extra cushion that
rvIfl5Q66T038,,,  make you feel extra a little more
rvIfl5Q66T038,,,  secure hopefully make sense okay second
rvIfl5Q66T038,,,  thing and not what the hell 's any other
rvIfl5Q66T039,11.09,11.21,  you figger and I do n't receive many
rvIfl5Q66T039,,,  time the person 's Thomas to the
rvIfl5Q66T039,,,  PowerPoint a dirty talking and talking
rvIfl5Q66T039,,,  other than part are showing or showing
rvIfl5Q66T039,,,  something will be different or justify
rvIfl5Q66T039,,,  and is no Lewis people take a look at
rvIfl5Q66T040,11.24,11.38,  your key they look at the motor pool
rvIfl5Q66T040,,,  and I this is not a joke and it 's funny
rvIfl5Q66T040,,,  now but this is not a job I wa I
rvIfl5Q66T040,,,  witness the presentation when something
rvIfl5Q66T040,,,  started burning in the lap of the room
rvIfl5Q66T040,,,  and people started leaving in the guy to
rvIfl5Q66T041,11.4,11.54,  notice because when we do start when I
rvIfl5Q66T041,,,  kid you not they got a staged reading of
rvIfl5Q66T041,,,  it power cord and people started
rvIfl5Q66T041,,,  leaving the room and get it noticed
rvIfl5Q66T041,,,  do n't talk to your PowerPoint I know
rvIfl5Q66T041,,,  you 're very proud of it any of a very
rvIfl5Q66T042,11.56,12.08,  intimate relationship with your partner
rvIfl5Q66T042,,,  it 's a great house but a lot of time
rvIfl5Q66T042,,,  preparing it do n't talk to it talk to
rvIfl5Q66T042,,,  your audience because nothing make
rvIfl5Q66T042,,,  worst impression than
rvIfl5Q66T042,,,  doe it so now we 're going to be talking
rvIfl5Q66T043,12.11,12.22,  about my power point that I wrote and I
rvIfl5Q66T043,,,  really like so I 'm going to look at you
rvIfl5Q66T043,,,  ever and I 'm going to be off my hard way
rvIfl5Q66T043,,,  after about 45 second of that you 're
rvIfl5Q66T043,,,  done you have no connection with me we
rvIfl5Q66T043,,,  have no eye contact you do n't listen to
rvIfl5Q66T044,12.24,12.41,  me and you can lead we 're a snowman if
rvIfl5Q66T044,,,  you really think that everything that
rvIfl5Q66T044,,,  you really have to say your present can
rvIfl5Q66T044,,,  be written on it than the water well for
rvIfl5Q66T044,,,  some reason we 're out there this is very
rvIfl5Q66T044,,,  important and this is not only to
rvIfl5Q66T045,12.42,12.59,  powerpoint it 's for the board the poster
rvIfl5Q66T045,,,  basically do n't talk to it talk to your
rvIfl5Q66T045,,,  kid remember that your audio visual aid
rvIfl5Q66T045,,,  is not for you it 's for the people who
rvIfl5Q66T045,,,  you talk to in his defense it wa a
rvIfl5Q66T045,,,  friendly big one that wo n't work thing
rvIfl5Q66T046,13.01,13.18,  started burning so maybe you would you
rvIfl5Q66T046,,,  want me what you can smell it but
rvIfl5Q66T046,,,  literally they become bigger the other
rvIfl5Q66T046,,,  thing when you think I on his way what
rvIfl5Q66T046,,,  do you think people use of influence why
rvIfl5Q66T046,,,  do we have powerpoints and presentation
rvIfl5Q66T047,13.22,13.42,  because a lot of thing are easier
rvIfl5Q66T047,,,  explain grafton paragraph of coffee and
rvIfl5Q66T047,,,  yet how often you see people paragraph
rvIfl5Q66T047,,,  and paragraph and paragraph on this
rvIfl5Q66T047,,,  life one again we 're in ecology you
rvIfl5Q66T047,,,  ca n't read why do we use part with them
rvIfl5Q66T048,13.47,14.12,  no seriously like Wyatt life why do you
rvIfl5Q66T048,,,  have other visual a superstitious person
rvIfl5Q66T048,,,  because medium I 'd what you know I
rvIfl5Q66T048,,,  sometimes use it because it 's bad and if
rvIfl5Q66T048,,,  I invite have a option to use now I a
rvIfl5Q66T048,,,  certain thing are better explained with
rvIfl5Q66T049,14.14,14.35,  an audio visual aid my name is a explain
rvIfl5Q66T049,,,  is one structuring
rvIfl5Q66T049,,,  and
rvIfl5Q66T049,,,  another way to clarify what you say
rvIfl5Q66T049,,,  mm that 's true other work what are
rvIfl5Q66T049,,,  some like number percentage
rvIfl5Q66T050,14.38,14.56,  proportion it help to have a graph for
rvIfl5Q66T050,,,  it
rvIfl5Q66T050,,,  and fasten what what having something
rvIfl5Q66T050,,,  a sort of cleaning way I almost like
rvIfl5Q66T050,,,  you 're questioning
rvIfl5Q66T050,,,  what patient do not require resolution
rvIfl5Q66T051,15,15.12,  to make better and you can score a tough
rvIfl5Q66T051,,,  you cut you have a folk singer whatever
rvIfl5Q66T051,,,  it wa telling a story and it 's part of
rvIfl5Q66T051,,,  the point of it to have audience and
rvIfl5Q66T051,,,  reservation and I 'm to you maybe
rvIfl5Q66T051,,,  occasionally design something faculty
rvIfl5Q66T052,15.14,15.28,  here or whatever imagine my first
rvIfl5Q66T052,,,  galaxy it 's weather but you know they
rvIfl5Q66T052,,,  think you 're trying to picture no okay
rvIfl5Q66T052,,,  we 're studying the ancient culture of
rvIfl5Q66T052,,,  Eurasia and there 's hill and valley
rvIfl5Q66T052,,,  and rice arm or clever that 's fine if
rvIfl5Q66T053,15.32,15.49,  what 's required is just an impression or
rvIfl5Q66T053,,,  in general
rvIfl5Q66T053,,,  if you really need to show exactly how
rvIfl5Q66T053,,,  the curve go there 's nothing
rvIfl5Q66T053,,,  yeah even if you could absolutely
rvIfl5Q66T053,,,  accurate
rvIfl5Q66T054,15.54,16.07,  look at what house is good question
rvIfl5Q66T054,,,  about audio visual aid and three
rvIfl5Q66T054,,,  example you gave me were physical
rvIfl5Q66T054,,,  picture something it 's easier to see
rvIfl5Q66T054,,,  something if we have a picture of it
rvIfl5Q66T054,,,  structuring our presentation and
rvIfl5Q66T055,16.09,16.21,  visualizing certain concept like rat
rvIfl5Q66T055,,,  are like proportion now that we 've
rvIfl5Q66T055,,,  established that these are all three
rvIfl5Q66T055,,,  good reason to use an artificial lake
rvIfl5Q66T055,,,  think about other visual link that
rvIfl5Q66T055,,,  you 've seen people use and that you use
rvIfl5Q66T056,16.24,16.42,  how little do they have in common with
rvIfl5Q66T056,,,  these three purpose why people feel the
rvIfl5Q66T056,,,  need to write their presentation on the
rvIfl5Q66T056,,,  slide why is it relevant doe it show a
rvIfl5Q66T056,,,  picture doe it show a brown or doe it
rvIfl5Q66T056,,,  show structure no it doe n't show either
rvIfl5Q66T057,16.43,16.59,  it make you feel better that 's not the
rvIfl5Q66T057,,,  point of artificial rain I want you to
rvIfl5Q66T057,,,  think about your other visual aid very
rvIfl5Q66T057,,,  in a very utilitarian way am I using it
rvIfl5Q66T057,,,  do I need it doe it help my
rvIfl5Q66T057,,,  presentation because if it doe n't do n't
rvIfl5Q66T058,17.01,17.12,  like them cuz it doe n't make sense
rvIfl5Q66T058,,,  really and I understand it in some
rvIfl5Q66T058,,,  context if you like okay I 'm gon na show
rvIfl5Q66T058,,,  up there without a PowerPoint that 's not
rvIfl5Q66T058,,,  gon na be professional that 's not going
rvIfl5Q66T058,,,  to make sense they do n't have
rvIfl5Q66T059,17.13,17.28,  understanding have you ever seen so far
rvIfl5Q66T059,,,  is there a very professional college
rvIfl5Q66T059,,,  setting am i coming to you about serious
rvIfl5Q66T059,,,  stuff do you know what I 'm talking to
rvIfl5Q66T059,,,  you how am I use PowerPoint one where
rvIfl5Q66T059,,,  we manage I did n't have to put every
rvIfl5Q66T060,17.31,17.47,  single thing I say
rvIfl5Q66T060,,,  right and you still got it three I need
rvIfl5Q66T060,,,  just break free from the end between I
rvIfl5Q66T060,,,  throw the horrible PowerPoint pressure
rvIfl5Q66T060,,,  because that 's what we do we we think
rvIfl5Q66T060,,,  that we can not go out there in front of
rvIfl5Q66T061,17.49,18.02,  people if we do n't matter we ca n't
rvIfl5Q66T061,,,  it 's okay yeah now that you start from
rvIfl5Q66T061,,,  this point because this is the point I
rvIfl5Q66T061,,,  want you to start with I want you to
rvIfl5Q66T061,,,  start from the point where there is no
rvIfl5Q66T061,,,  power point and then a you build your
rvIfl5Q66T062,18.06,18.19,  presentation and you think about your
rvIfl5Q66T062,,,  artificial leg I want you to put thing
rvIfl5Q66T062,,,  on your power that are relevant and
rvIfl5Q66T062,,,  they are needed there and that you feel
rvIfl5Q66T062,,,  will increase the quality and relevance
rvIfl5Q66T062,,,  of your presentation that 's the way you
rvIfl5Q66T063,18.23,18.37,  think about your presentation is what is
rvIfl5Q66T063,,,  there that I need to help my audience
rvIfl5Q66T063,,,  see it better understand it better with
rvIfl5Q66T063,,,  Robert better three main reason for
rvIfl5Q66T063,,,  using on a visual and the usuals mention
rvIfl5Q66T063,,,  in fact the presentation is clarity
rvIfl5Q66T064,18.42,19.01,  retention
rvIfl5Q66T064,,,  and interest
rvIfl5Q66T064,,,  if your idea visually doe n't serve one
rvIfl5Q66T064,,,  of these three purpose it 's a little if
rvIfl5Q66T064,,,  it doe n't help your audience understand
rvIfl5Q66T064,,,  thing better than could not be
rvIfl5Q66T065,19.03,19.18,  understood and this is what Josh wa
rvIfl5Q66T065,,,  talking about graph proportion percent
rvIfl5Q66T065,,,  flow of thing is great Aboriginal later
rvIfl5Q66T065,,,  great for those when you show cycle so
rvIfl5Q66T065,,,  when you show change or when you show
rvIfl5Q66T065,,,  fit any rise or follow the trend or
rvIfl5Q66T066,19.23,19.37,  other percentage thing changing over
rvIfl5Q66T066,,,  time that 's that 's great retention
rvIfl5Q66T066,,,  that 's what Gloria wa talking about
rvIfl5Q66T066,,,  structuring the presentation what help
rvIfl5Q66T066,,,  your audience remember the presentation
rvIfl5Q66T066,,,  and remember where they are in the
rvIfl5Q66T067,19.38,19.52,  presentation that 's very important
rvIfl5Q66T067,,,  that 's our attention content to finally
rvIfl5Q66T067,,,  interest what make this presentation
rvIfl5Q66T067,,,  le boring every now and then it 's good
rvIfl5Q66T067,,,  to use your officer willing to trigger
rvIfl5Q66T067,,,  your audience 's interest a in if you
rvIfl5Q66T068,19.59,20.11,  talk about something that you think
rvIfl5Q66T068,,,  might not be very fascinating or my
rvIfl5Q66T068,,,  sound boring if you do n't show it think
rvIfl5Q66T068,,,  about some use of our visually that can
rvIfl5Q66T068,,,  make it may be a little more dramatic
rvIfl5Q66T068,,,  you can even do it with a graph you
rvIfl5Q66T069,20.13,20.36,  think about it okay I 'm telling you that
rvIfl5Q66T069,,,  in 1999 800
rvIfl5Q66T069,,,  in the US and then in 2009 winter 10
rvIfl5Q66T069,,,  year later 50 million people that 's up
rvIfl5Q66T069,,,  and I 'm telling you that and you hearing
rvIfl5Q66T069,,,  what I 'm saying okay but if I do this
rvIfl5Q66T070,20.44,20.58,  that 's very clear and that will make you
rvIfl5Q66T070,,,  remember wow seriously that 's a big
rvIfl5Q66T070,,,  change if you make this graph go from
rvIfl5Q66T070,,,  this one to that point and you can do it
rvIfl5Q66T070,,,  in PowerPoint very light there you go
rvIfl5Q66T070,,,  what happened you 're gon na remember that
rvIfl5Q66T071,21.01,21.16,  that 's going to create some interest all
rvIfl5Q66T071,,,  these three were mentioned by it and
rvIfl5Q66T071,,,  obviously our relevant recent study
rvIfl5Q66T071,,,  part in other visual aid if you do n't
rvIfl5Q66T071,,,  need for one of these reason do n't do
rvIfl5Q66T071,,,  it once we decided to put it in there
rvIfl5Q66T072,21.23,21.35,  because you feel better and you need if
rvIfl5Q66T072,,,  you want your power going out there are
rvIfl5Q66T072,,,  a few thing that are very important
rvIfl5Q66T072,,,  that I almost I do n't want you to feel
rvIfl5Q66T072,,,  like I 'm oversimplifying it for you but
rvIfl5Q66T072,,,  those are very important thing make
rvIfl5Q66T073,21.37,21.53,  sure your audio visual lake is physical
rvIfl5Q66T073,,,  form if you have audio make sure not to
rvIfl5Q66T073,,,  hear it if you have picture or the
rvIfl5Q66T073,,,  video or something that you go into a
rvIfl5Q66T073,,,  marginally screen make sure the
rvIfl5Q66T073,,,  definition is high enough for u to be
rvIfl5Q66T074,21.55,22.06,  able to see it those are stealing thing
rvIfl5Q66T074,,,  but they make sense if you 're giving for
rvIfl5Q66T074,,,  instance a presentation at a conference
rvIfl5Q66T074,,,  sometimes think that thing that our
rvIfl5Q66T074,,,  computer screen look just fine if you
rvIfl5Q66T074,,,  blow them up to a size that allows
rvIfl5Q66T075,22.08,22.19,  people to
rvIfl5Q66T075,,,  yeah the resolution becomes just so
rvIfl5Q66T075,,,  happy that you can barely see what 's on
rvIfl5Q66T075,,,  the screen doe importantly to remember
rvIfl5Q66T075,,,  the other thing to remember if you 're
rvIfl5Q66T075,,,  showing something you 're in a smaller
rvIfl5Q66T076,22.21,22.32,  room and sing and you show me the graph
rvIfl5Q66T076,,,  where you show here something that you
rvIfl5Q66T076,,,  physically falling do n't do this a you
rvIfl5Q66T076,,,  can clearly see because josh inquiry
rvIfl5Q66T076,,,  he ca n't see anything if I do this and
rvIfl5Q66T076,,,  people do that sometimes they would show
rvIfl5Q66T077,22.34,22.49,  a model for instance and they would put
rvIfl5Q66T077,,,  this model over here a you can clearly
rvIfl5Q66T077,,,  see in my model and then you can but you
rvIfl5Q66T077,,,  can you ca n't even see my autumn those
rvIfl5Q66T077,,,  are important think about those those
rvIfl5Q66T077,,,  reason are wide sometimes mention if
rvIfl5Q66T078,22.51,23.03,  you have the opportunity check the room
rvIfl5Q66T078,,,  out first because when since if you and
rvIfl5Q66T078,,,  in some science mod are really
rvIfl5Q66T078,,,  important you show home you use them
rvIfl5Q66T078,,,  make sure you can display them to make
rvIfl5Q66T078,,,  sure people can see that make sure you
rvIfl5Q66T079,23.06,23.23,  know how to place yourself in roughton
rvIfl5Q66T079,,,  to do n't get it away or anything like
rvIfl5Q66T079,,,  that if you 're using something that is
rvIfl5Q66T079,,,  very dynamic or very colorful make sure
rvIfl5Q66T079,,,  that it is understandable sometimes
rvIfl5Q66T079,,,  people do overload oh I 'm going to do
rvIfl5Q66T080,23.25,23.39,  bright green with orange you 're bad at
rvIfl5Q66T080,,,  the end of it you 're just end of the
rvIfl5Q66T080,,,  screen filled with color but you still
rvIfl5Q66T080,,,  understand what 's going on those are
rvIfl5Q66T080,,,  really important those are important to
rvIfl5Q66T080,,,  remember those are n't important to keep
rvIfl5Q66T081,23.41,24.01,  in mind a you 're preparing for your
rvIfl5Q66T081,,,  presentation finally which I mentioned
rvIfl5Q66T081,,,  at the very beginning but I again
rvIfl5Q66T081,,,  you 're all usually is n't for you it 's
rvIfl5Q66T081,,,  not for you do n't make your PowerPoint
rvIfl5Q66T081,,,  your outline I strongly encourage you to
rvIfl5Q66T082,24.07,24.23,  either have your note on the side of
rvIfl5Q66T082,,,  your slideshow which is possible or have
rvIfl5Q66T082,,,  your note underneath your slide but
rvIfl5Q66T082,,,  they do n't show on the screen or have
rvIfl5Q66T082,,,  enough time in hand because you 're
rvIfl5Q66T082,,,  what 's showing here is not for you
rvIfl5Q66T083,24.28,24.45,  people who listen to you do n't care how
rvIfl5Q66T083,,,  you got there they are interested in why
rvIfl5Q66T083,,,  they are seeing it if it 's only for you
rvIfl5Q66T083,,,  put it only hotline put it next to it
rvIfl5Q66T083,,,  do n't you see what I 'm saying this is
rvIfl5Q66T083,,,  very important and this is why people
rvIfl5Q66T084,24.46,25.02,  read their hard work because they
rvIfl5Q66T084,,,  prepare your powerpoints for themselves
rvIfl5Q66T084,,,  so then they need them to figure out
rvIfl5Q66T084,,,  where they are thence know how it work
rvIfl5Q66T084,,,  this is for you not for me if I need to
rvIfl5Q66T084,,,  remember that this is very keen
rvIfl5Q66T085,25.03,25.16,  attention and interest I 'm going to
rvIfl5Q66T085,,,  write it over here otherwise they all
rvIfl5Q66T085,,,  good okay so plan why is it important oh
rvIfl5Q66T085,,,  ok finally besides looking order not
rvIfl5Q66T085,,,  noticing that the root on fire it did
rvIfl5Q66T085,,,  to reduce it in a way because if you
rvIfl5Q66T086,25.19,25.3,  have to be drawn PowerPoint
rvIfl5Q66T086,,,  subconsciously what people are thinking
rvIfl5Q66T086,,,  is I 'm okay why do you not know what you
rvIfl5Q66T086,,,  do n't know because if you need to read
rvIfl5Q66T086,,,  it then why do you need me try to the
rvIfl5Q66T086,,,  one rocket you know what 's that ready ah
rvIfl5Q66T087,25.35,25.48,  the other reason why not to write
rvIfl5Q66T087,,,  everything on your PowerPoint is why do
rvIfl5Q66T087,,,  you keep
rvIfl5Q66T087,,,  if they can meet ago make yourself
rvIfl5Q66T087,,,  relevant make your audience pay
rvIfl5Q66T087,,,  attention to you because if you provide
rvIfl5Q66T088,25.51,26.06,  everything for them that white then just
rvIfl5Q66T088,,,  go on just put your heart where you go
rvIfl5Q66T088,,,  cause if we do n't need it you then what
rvIfl5Q66T088,,,  what 's the point of the whole thing you
rvIfl5Q66T088,,,  have to have certain information that
rvIfl5Q66T088,,,  come from you and only from you because
rvIfl5Q66T089,26.09,26.34,  that 's why you 're there that 's why we 're
rvIfl5Q66T089,,,  interested in you not your power
rvIfl5Q66T089,,,  two more thing I want to mention first
rvIfl5Q66T089,,,  if you have slide and you have outlined
rvIfl5Q66T089,,,  separately include change of slide in
rvIfl5Q66T089,,,  your outline that 's an important thing
rvIfl5Q66T090,26.38,26.54,  to remember to include your APA year of
rvIfl5Q66T090,,,  your visual aid whatever it is in your
rvIfl5Q66T090,,,  outline for yourself so you know when
rvIfl5Q66T090,,,  you need to change the slide so you know
rvIfl5Q66T090,,,  when you 're going to move from here to
rvIfl5Q66T090,,,  here and for instance work with a model
rvIfl5Q66T091,26.56,27.1,  sometimes what we get very stressed out
rvIfl5Q66T091,,,  we forget what is supposed to be
rvIfl5Q66T091,,,  accompanying what we 're talking what I
rvIfl5Q66T091,,,  it happened to be at least several time
rvIfl5Q66T091,,,  when in my public speaking class when I
rvIfl5Q66T091,,,  tell student to very help your body
rvIfl5Q66T092,27.11,27.29,  mutilated practice with it what people
rvIfl5Q66T092,,,  do is they will give my lecture about we
rvIfl5Q66T092,,,  do n't have to have found some rest able
rvIfl5Q66T092,,,  to talk to constrain echo enhance it
rvIfl5Q66T092,,,  for the whole street this one 's life and
rvIfl5Q66T092,,,  then they deliver their my foot and they
rvIfl5Q66T093,27.3,27.43,  deliver delivered delivered and then
rvIfl5Q66T093,,,  they 'd rather like oh and i teach not
rvIfl5Q66T093,,,  enough it 's at least two time every
rvIfl5Q66T093,,,  corner because if you do n't practice
rvIfl5Q66T093,,,  with your or if you like you do n't
rvIfl5Q66T093,,,  remember your hanna beth and people were
rvIfl5Q66T094,27.45,28.02,  getting by on serving so included in
rvIfl5Q66T094,,,  your outline if you have something that
rvIfl5Q66T094,,,  you need to do change which included in
rvIfl5Q66T094,,,  your plan and finally you know how when
rvIfl5Q66T094,,,  you 're drifting in
rvIfl5Q66T094,,,  kind of sitting in presentation anything
rvIfl5Q66T095,28.04,28.21,  bother good boy it 's not what do you
rvIfl5Q66T095,,,  read this part of the person that 's
rvIfl5Q66T095,,,  behind them or they talk about this
rvIfl5Q66T095,,,  fireman side and we talked over my way
rvIfl5Q66T095,,,  of what were you through this one and
rvIfl5Q66T095,,,  this one is a riddle these little note
rvIfl5Q66T096,28.22,28.34,  that they have here a little note thank
rvIfl5Q66T096,,,  you that 's kind of the cool little
rvIfl5Q66T096,,,  corner here I wa n't on the ornament I
rvIfl5Q66T096,,,  like that I wonder if I could do that
rvIfl5Q66T096,,,  for my ta class and then that purple
rvIfl5Q66T096,,,  that look really weird indeed they
rvIfl5Q66T097,28.36,28.5,  would n't go with me and you got all that
rvIfl5Q66T097,,,  already well if you want your audience
rvIfl5Q66T097,,,  not to do better show the thing that
rvIfl5Q66T097,,,  you talk about only when you talk about
rvIfl5Q66T097,,,  them do n't show thing you do n't talk
rvIfl5Q66T097,,,  about and do n't talk about thing you 're
rvIfl5Q66T098,28.51,29.1,  not showing so for instance I absolutely
rvIfl5Q66T098,,,  for instance if you talk about an
rvIfl5Q66T098,,,  elephant zebra in a squirrel when you
rvIfl5Q66T098,,,  talk about an elephant a picture of an
rvIfl5Q66T098,,,  elephant and do n't say in a minute okay
rvIfl5Q66T098,,,  we 're going to come from 0 so 0 know why
rvIfl5Q66T099,29.13,29.26,  I 'm sure we go or mono I 'm talking about
rvIfl5Q66T099,,,  it look we 're switching to a zebra and
rvIfl5Q66T099,,,  here the 0 NE picture 10 the picture
rvIfl5Q66T099,,,  do n't say holy way about elephant so
rvIfl5Q66T099,,,  the other thing no no no no we 're done
rvIfl5Q66T099,,,  we 're on sequence right now what happens
rvIfl5Q66T0100,29.29,29.43,  if you want to say something between a
rvIfl5Q66T0100,,,  zebra a squirrel do you leave a zebra or
rvIfl5Q66T0100,,,  you go her squirrel you have a blank
rvIfl5Q66T0100,,,  slide I 'm just right in between u in
rvIfl5Q66T0100,,,  grant world if you need one because
rvIfl5Q66T0100,,,  you 're talking about something that 's
rvIfl5Q66T0101,29.45,29.57,  not zebra related not yet squirrel
rvIfl5Q66T0101,,,  related but important to put in the
rvIfl5Q66T0101,,,  middle then Clint is life so you have
rvIfl5Q66T0101,,,  your zebra you have a visual break for
rvIfl5Q66T0101,,,  this one there
rvIfl5Q66T0101,,,  Jersey rather than already horse world
rvIfl5Q66T0102,29.59,30.15,  yet no it 's not silly man I 'm sorry is
rvIfl5Q66T0102,,,  that confusing very often because people
rvIfl5Q66T0102,,,  there for people do your audience would
rvIfl5Q66T0102,,,  go ahead if you show them the side
rvIfl5Q66T0102,,,  they 're gon na read it if you show them
rvIfl5Q66T0102,,,  something that you 're not talking about
rvIfl5Q66T0103,30.16,30.28,  yet of course they 're going to be
rvIfl5Q66T0103,,,  reading it not they 're good listening to
rvIfl5Q66T0103,,,  you why ooh there 's something you think
rvIfl5Q66T0103,,,  about do n't be afraid to turn your
rvIfl5Q66T0103,,,  PowerPoint off for a second if you 're
rvIfl5Q66T0103,,,  done with this section before you move
rvIfl5Q66T0104,30.3,30.45,  on to this section put an ice cream it 's
rvIfl5Q66T0104,,,  perfectly acceptable on asking about the
rvIfl5Q66T0104,,,  blank screen and also a good had they
rvIfl5Q66T0104,,,  kind of get people out of this car may
rvIfl5Q66T0104,,,  notice were there
rvIfl5Q66T0104,,,  and you can put a blank screen that
rvIfl5Q66T0105,30.48,31.01,  they 're like oh I forgot this person is
rvIfl5Q66T0105,,,  talking so if that 's a great point
rvIfl5Q66T0105,,,  absolutely yeah and that 's that 's a
rvIfl5Q66T0105,,,  great point wa my major symptom you 're
rvIfl5Q66T0105,,,  there and they forget her there if you
rvIfl5Q66T0105,,,  are completely and utterly year they
rvIfl5Q66T0106,31.05,31.3,  really forget that they 're listening to
rvIfl5Q66T0106,,,  you they 're listening to your power
rvIfl5Q66T0106,,,  that 's that only attended point of
rvIfl5Q66T0106,,,  personal again where they do n't make it
rvIfl5Q66T0106,,,  better myself and this line there you go
rvIfl5Q66T0106,,,  now this to be but no it 's a very valid
rvIfl5Q66T0107,31.33,31.53,  point it get people kind of like you
rvIfl5Q66T0107,,,  know and it 's helpful like 20 minute
rvIfl5Q66T0107,,,  reservation good to give you 100 okay
rvIfl5Q66T0107,,,  let 's go hooray it 's a good wake up ok
rvIfl5Q66T0107,,,  so to conclude make sure you do n't talk
rvIfl5Q66T0107,,,  about thing for not showing talk about
rvIfl5Q66T0108,31.56,32.1,  thing up in yourself and do n't show
rvIfl5Q66T0108,,,  them money not our problem um start from
rvIfl5Q66T0108,,,  the point where there is no PowerPoint
rvIfl5Q66T0108,,,  start from a point where this is what I
rvIfl5Q66T0108,,,  have to say what in it could it be
rvIfl5Q66T0108,,,  better illustrated with some bobby pin
rvIfl5Q66T0109,32.12,32.34,  will help do n't talk to it
rvIfl5Q66T0109,,,  um and trick with all these at once and
rvIfl5Q66T0109,,,  all sometimes we think thing work but
rvIfl5Q66T0109,,,  we all need to look at all of it going
rvIfl5Q66T0109,,,  we will know that it doe n't do the
rvIfl5Q66T0109,,,  question about relevance cavity
rvIfl5Q66T0110,32.38,32.58,  interest the blank slide thing is really
rvIfl5Q66T0110,,,  using me because i feel like if i were
rvIfl5Q66T0110,,,  to show that at a conference or in class
rvIfl5Q66T0110,,,  everyone what is anybody in the state so
rvIfl5Q66T0110,,,  that you i have to say that oh this link
rvIfl5Q66T0110,,,  slide is to get you to focus on me now
rvIfl5Q66T0111,33.01,33.13,  do i explain that or joy discipline it
rvIfl5Q66T0111,,,  but yeah if you cure several that 's
rvIfl5Q66T0111,,,  about a point all of a sudden had a
rvIfl5Q66T0111,,,  black screen people might think Oh what
rvIfl5Q66T0111,,,  happened there are several way to go
rvIfl5Q66T0111,,,  about it one way if you meet this
rvIfl5Q66T0112,33.16,33.27,  breakage if you talk about one thing and
rvIfl5Q66T0112,,,  then you 're mean no you do n't need any
rvIfl5Q66T0112,,,  audio visual leg and then you need it
rvIfl5Q66T0112,,,  again what you can do is you can put
rvIfl5Q66T0112,,,  something on the slide that let them
rvIfl5Q66T0112,,,  know it 's still in the code of your
rvIfl5Q66T0113,33.3,33.4,  powerpoint it 's in the same theme sure
rvIfl5Q66T0113,,,  but there 's nothing on it so basically
rvIfl5Q66T0113,,,  like if you 're powerful point in
rvIfl5Q66T0113,,,  schuyler green just that 's one way to go
rvIfl5Q66T0113,,,  on it and the same way to go about it
rvIfl5Q66T0113,,,  and I 'm glad you mentioned it because it
rvIfl5Q66T0114,33.43,33.56,  make it more conversational for
rvIfl5Q66T0114,,,  naturalism you can totally tell let me
rvIfl5Q66T0114,,,  now address something else or let me
rvIfl5Q66T0114,,,  just talk about egg you just put it up
rvIfl5Q66T0114,,,  there and you address it in a way that
rvIfl5Q66T0114,,,  let them know we do n't need it right
rvIfl5Q66T0115,33.59,34.11,  now you can even say okay let 's forget
rvIfl5Q66T0115,,,  how partnership continued and then you
rvIfl5Q66T0115,,,  can go back to your site so there are
rvIfl5Q66T0115,,,  several thing to do what you can and I
rvIfl5Q66T0115,,,  do n't see why not absolutely you look
rvIfl5Q66T0115,,,  joke about it you know or or comment on
rvIfl5Q66T0116,34.14,34.26,  some
rvIfl5Q66T0116,,,  let them know I do what I 'm doing about
rvIfl5Q66T0116,,,  or which is very important people tend
rvIfl5Q66T0116,,,  to assume that I hope no hole did
rvIfl5Q66T0116,,,  something happen or have it like in the
rvIfl5Q66T0116,,,  theme of your PowerPoint but just with
rvIfl5Q66T0117,34.29,34.52,  no content another good way to do that
rvIfl5Q66T0117,,,  is to change where you are so allows my
rvIfl5Q66T0117,,,  favorite enjoy and then you have blank
rvIfl5Q66T0117,,,  screen do hanson and a walk friend
rvIfl5Q66T0117,,,  green again you 're still presenting and
rvIfl5Q66T0117,,,  you know what you 're doing it yeah so
rvIfl5Q66T0118,34.56,35.14,  100 that if you if you have a template
rvIfl5Q66T0118,,,  very slight or very few just wait if you
rvIfl5Q66T0118,,,  blink into black would be something they
rvIfl5Q66T0118,,,  would n't boot give me pleasure that 's
rvIfl5Q66T0118,,,  intentional change and I like
rvIfl5Q66T0118,,,  you can press the point that 's great but
rvIfl5Q66T0119,35.17,35.33,  we need black so then you can approach
rvIfl5Q66T0119,,,  to your computer point and say well
rvIfl5Q66T0119,,,  let 's talk about this yeah you can kind
rvIfl5Q66T0119,,,  of make it visible that you 're turning
rvIfl5Q66T0119,,,  it off that 's another yet and you
rvIfl5Q66T0119,,,  switching that 's another way to approach
rvIfl5Q66T0120,35.34,35.47,  it absolutely sometimes you can discus
rvIfl5Q66T0120,,,  on the machine to help these kid where
rvIfl5Q66T0120,,,  you can switch the what is this
rvIfl5Q66T0120,,,  hopefully I can see if you make you want
rvIfl5Q66T0120,,,  Oakland come on always find effective
rvIfl5Q66T0120,,,  people at the beginning in heaven
rvIfl5Q66T0121,35.49,36.06,  outline maybe three point and talk
rvIfl5Q66T0121,,,  about the finished one point let u show
rvIfl5Q66T0121,,,  that next point on this nice to know now
rvIfl5Q66T0121,,,  that 's i can say talk about three thing
rvIfl5Q66T0121,,,  first talk number one and voice which to
rvIfl5Q66T0121,,,  number two let 's put up the title of two
rvIfl5Q66T0122,36.1,36.24,  oh and that 'll give you an opportunity
rvIfl5Q66T0122,,,  like top three and freedom a while
rvIfl5Q66T0122,,,  before you go into yeah that 's a good
rvIfl5Q66T0122,,,  thing too if you have like label kind
rvIfl5Q66T0122,,,  of like if you have on the main point
rvIfl5Q66T0122,,,  and it ha some point you can just put
rvIfl5Q66T0123,36.27,36.47,  your main point on the screen and just
rvIfl5Q66T0123,,,  talk about yourself once yeah that might
rvIfl5Q66T0123,,,  be good idea to you sir that power point
rvIfl5Q66T0123,,,  is n't always necessary but i 'm wondering
rvIfl5Q66T0123,,,  if you do n't recover quite you see maybe
rvIfl5Q66T0123,,,  wa n't professional or le prepared so
rvIfl5Q66T0124,36.49,37.03,  to kind of bridge that gap what other
rvIfl5Q66T0124,,,  kind of visual aid which bring in the
rvIfl5Q66T0124,,,  power point because whenever i need of
rvIfl5Q66T0124,,,  doing like a poster instead I guess
rvIfl5Q66T0124,,,  HYFR great for losing every foot thing
rvIfl5Q66T0124,,,  for it and i boosted and I feel like
rvIfl5Q66T0125,37.06,37.18,  that 's not professional eater well think
rvIfl5Q66T0125,,,  about our first guest lecture she did n't
rvIfl5Q66T0125,,,  have a house point she had hanged up for
rvIfl5Q66T0125,,,  u with the structure for presentation
rvIfl5Q66T0125,,,  if you have small enough audience that
rvIfl5Q66T0125,,,  might be a way to go ah what else always
rvIfl5Q66T0126,37.24,37.37,  few free to use aboard a you like that
rvIfl5Q66T0126,,,  give structure to and that 's really good
rvIfl5Q66T0126,,,  if you create thing a you go if you
rvIfl5Q66T0126,,,  want to show a certain progression or if
rvIfl5Q66T0126,,,  you want to end up with a structure like
rvIfl5Q66T0126,,,  what we did last time with the structure
rvIfl5Q66T0127,37.4,37.52,  the board I felt wa a good use of audio
rvIfl5Q66T0127,,,  visual aid this last time because I wa
rvIfl5Q66T0127,,,  kind of talking about the zebra and I
rvIfl5Q66T0127,,,  went and then we ended up with the
rvIfl5Q66T0127,,,  structure of the horn so if you have the
rvIfl5Q66T0127,,,  opportunity to use the board that might
rvIfl5Q66T0128,37.53,38.05,  be a good idea sometimes then you do n't
rvIfl5Q66T0128,,,  need an actual PowerPoint presentation
rvIfl5Q66T0128,,,  even though you can use your computer
rvIfl5Q66T0128,,,  for instance if you do n't know your
rvIfl5Q66T0128,,,  research and you need a table because
rvIfl5Q66T0128,,,  you present result you do n't have to
rvIfl5Q66T0129,38.09,38.25,  have five slide you can have a slide
rvIfl5Q66T0129,,,  with your result and that 's it it still
rvIfl5Q66T0129,,,  show people you have the result you
rvIfl5Q66T0129,,,  have all your peep and whatever you
rvIfl5Q66T0129,,,  the and they still see that you know
rvIfl5Q66T0129,,,  what you 're talking about but you do n't
rvIfl5Q66T0130,38.27,38.44,  physically need to kind of like build up
rvIfl5Q66T0130,,,  on it then get so many people do too and
rvIfl5Q66T0130,,,  I think you do need you know but um
rvIfl5Q66T0130,,,  absolutely feel free to use your
rvIfl5Q66T0130,,,  computer joke and even have a picture or
rvIfl5Q66T0130,,,  your result or table what everything
rvIfl5Q66T0131,38.46,39.17,  but the board sometimes like our first
rvIfl5Q66T0131,,,  is a traditional and up for u I use the
rvIfl5Q66T0131,,,  ball constantly out my appointment time
rvIfl5Q66T0131,,,  I do n't absolutely necessarily have to
rvIfl5Q66T0131,,,  know it is a good way to use the laser
rvIfl5Q66T0131,,,  it depends would I would hesitate to
rvIfl5Q66T0132,39.22,39.35,  answer them brush this question in a
rvIfl5Q66T0132,,,  very yes or no fashion because it 's so
rvIfl5Q66T0132,,,  much depends on the content like I can
rvIfl5Q66T0132,,,  imagine some scientific presentation
rvIfl5Q66T0132,,,  where they 're showing thing on the
rvIfl5Q66T0132,,,  model or in space where it really
rvIfl5Q66T0133,39.38,39.51,  matter where we look at and it 's very
rvIfl5Q66T0133,,,  important for u to to be looking at
rvIfl5Q66T0133,,,  exactly what the speaker showing u and
rvIfl5Q66T0133,,,  obviously like your pointer that case is
rvIfl5Q66T0133,,,  better than TV so here oh my sliding
rvIfl5Q66T0133,,,  lose them absolutely um at the same time
rvIfl5Q66T0134,39.55,40.07,  I agree with you sometimes it 's an
rvIfl5Q66T0134,,,  overload sometimes people would use a
rvIfl5Q66T0134,,,  laser pointer to point to their power
rvIfl5Q66T0134,,,  and everything okay I can see about you
rvIfl5Q66T0134,,,  know it 's on the hall there and I can
rvIfl5Q66T0134,,,  even figure out which paragraph you 're
rvIfl5Q66T0135,40.08,40.23,  reading whoo so yeah sometimes it 's kind
rvIfl5Q66T0135,,,  of animal so I would say just go a you
rvIfl5Q66T0135,,,  like kind of go back to this is it 's
rvIfl5Q66T0135,,,  going hope them if it 's something that
rvIfl5Q66T0135,,,  will really help your audience know
rvIfl5Q66T0135,,,  exactly what you want if it 's a
rvIfl5Q66T0136,40.25,40.44,  necessary one one for the next
rvIfl5Q66T0136,,,  in my hand
rvIfl5Q66T0136,,,  is it you know you 're going to talk
rvIfl5Q66T0136,,,  about it next you can duplicate that
rvIfl5Q66T0136,,,  slide and then you just have my circle
rvIfl5Q66T0136,,,  of it so that 's that 's always a good one
rvIfl5Q66T0137,40.48,41.01,  that is true you can just point to it or
rvIfl5Q66T0137,,,  you can cut a circle or you pick up
rvIfl5Q66T0137,,,  that 's sometimes what people do is they
rvIfl5Q66T0137,,,  take a part they have a slide to the
rvIfl5Q66T0137,,,  general picture or not or something and
rvIfl5Q66T0137,,,  then they just take apart and larger
rvIfl5Q66T0138,41.02,41.17,  than that 's the next slide then
rvIfl5Q66T0138,,,  sometimes a good way to and I I figured
rvIfl5Q66T0138,,,  that out when I practicing am i pointing
rvIfl5Q66T0138,,,  at my screen and one way that I do it I
rvIfl5Q66T0138,,,  do it over the phone with my mom for we
rvIfl5Q66T0138,,,  both have the power cord the division
rvIfl5Q66T0139,41.18,41.33,  and then I give my presentation to her
rvIfl5Q66T0139,,,  over the phone and I come up with am I
rvIfl5Q66T0139,,,  having to stop and be like oh are you
rvIfl5Q66T0139,,,  being at this part of the slide and
rvIfl5Q66T0139,,,  that 's right figure out they call me too
rvIfl5Q66T0139,,,  practicing and figuring out what device
rvIfl5Q66T0140,41.43,42.18,  where I 'm supposed to be showing like
rvIfl5Q66T0140,,,  that wa n't necessarily following
rvIfl5Q66T0140,,,  i made a new piece of like
rvIfl5Q66T0140,,,  this is a very good question where to
rvIfl5Q66T0140,,,  include your end up with unique because
rvIfl5Q66T0140,,,  the problem is if you give them the
rvIfl5Q66T0141,42.2,42.34,  handout for the presentation they 're
rvIfl5Q66T0141,,,  going to read it if you give the
rvIfl5Q66T0141,,,  handout in the middle of presentation
rvIfl5Q66T0141,,,  that is going to be this overhead and
rvIfl5Q66T0141,,,  then you lose the attention again if
rvIfl5Q66T0141,,,  there is a way for you to do it
rvIfl5Q66T0142,42.37,42.51,  sometimes it 's best to not give a
rvIfl5Q66T0142,,,  handout present what you 're talking
rvIfl5Q66T0142,,,  about and say I 'm going to give you this
rvIfl5Q66T0142,,,  hand up at the end of the presentation
rvIfl5Q66T0142,,,  so do n't worry you do n't have to write
rvIfl5Q66T0142,,,  everything down you go through the
rvIfl5Q66T0143,42.54,43.08,  process and then you give them the
rvIfl5Q66T0143,,,  actual ground poor or tape or something
rvIfl5Q66T0143,,,  that help them do it when they need to
rvIfl5Q66T0143,,,  identify or go through the processor or
rvIfl5Q66T0143,,,  classify or whatever you are talking
rvIfl5Q66T0143,,,  about sometimes this work then you can
rvIfl5Q66T0144,43.1,43.23,  just be like i 'm going to give you this
rvIfl5Q66T0144,,,  at the end of the presentation so let 's
rvIfl5Q66T0144,,,  just take a look at this in their opener
rvIfl5Q66T0144,,,  sometimes what work is if you have
rvIfl5Q66T0144,,,  enough time to give the end up like five
rvIfl5Q66T0144,,,  minute before the presentation you can
rvIfl5Q66T0145,43.27,43.38,  do it and then from the beginning say
rvIfl5Q66T0145,,,  the handout i gave you will not be
rvIfl5Q66T0145,,,  relevant until the second part of my
rvIfl5Q66T0145,,,  presentation or until i get there
rvIfl5Q66T0145,,,  they 're trying to get you people to let
rvIfl5Q66T0145,,,  go and need it right now so if you can
rvIfl5Q66T0146,43.41,43.54,  dead sometimes a good idea if you have a
rvIfl5Q66T0146,,,  small audience you can risk passing the
rvIfl5Q66T0146,,,  hand up in your presentation because
rvIfl5Q66T0146,,,  it 's all gon na take
rvIfl5Q66T0146,,,  we have 58 people it 's another thing on
rvIfl5Q66T0146,,,  deposit even while you 're talking when
rvIfl5Q66T0147,43.57,44.12,  you 're ready for it then sit tough one
rvIfl5Q66T0147,,,  though it 's it 's a good question because
rvIfl5Q66T0147,,,  the way I 'll answer it is think about
rvIfl5Q66T0147,,,  the way to do it that would get away
rvIfl5Q66T0147,,,  with presentation at least they get
rvIfl5Q66T0147,,,  communicative orientation what will
rvIfl5Q66T0148,44.15,44.28,  facilitate my message the best do I want
rvIfl5Q66T0148,,,  them to look at it because this is
rvIfl5Q66T0148,,,  crucial do I want that the focus this
rvIfl5Q66T0148,,,  because this is crucial or is it really
rvIfl5Q66T0148,,,  really important and necessary that they
rvIfl5Q66T0148,,,  have a piece of paper in front of them
rvIfl5Q66T0149,44.29,44.43,  when I talk about it because if so then
rvIfl5Q66T0149,,,  maybe I sacrifice 45 second of their
rvIfl5Q66T0149,,,  attention but to make sure that everyone
rvIfl5Q66T0149,,,  ha a paper that 's kind of kind of
rvIfl5Q66T0149,,,  approaching think about your message and
rvIfl5Q66T0149,,,  what 's the most important thing in it
rvIfl5Q66T0150,44.45,44.58,  the picture that they can follow and
rvIfl5Q66T0150,,,  then relate or the paper and run out
rvIfl5Q66T0150,,,  there before the can they wait till the
rvIfl5Q66T0150,,,  end or is it very important they start
rvIfl5Q66T0150,,,  with it sometimes if you want to be
rvIfl5Q66T0150,,,  concerned if it enough if you can that 's
rvIfl5Q66T0151,45.01,45.23,  a good thing to do too if you really
rvIfl5Q66T0151,,,  need to hand out start with it they 're
rvIfl5Q66T0151,,,  looking at it anyway so if you can
rvIfl5Q66T0151,,,  any other question
rvIfl5Q66T0151,,,  if you like a little more ready to
rvIfl5Q66T0151,,,  consult certain issue or address some
rvIfl5Q66T0152,45.27,45.43,  thing that might be helpful in the
rvIfl5Q66T0152,,,  future structure wise or PowerPoint
rvIfl5Q66T0152,,,  right so I always wonder too much
rvIfl5Q66T0152,,,  information in California not enough
rvIfl5Q66T0152,,,  information sometimes people need their
rvIfl5Q66T0152,,,  PowerPoint sometimes we do n't really
rvIfl5Q66T0153,45.45,45.57,  that they put a bunch of stuff up so I
rvIfl5Q66T0153,,,  ca n't concentrate a live in PowerPoint
rvIfl5Q66T0153,,,  at the same time it 's inclusive but i
rvIfl5Q66T0153,,,  think if i look at what you 've told u
rvIfl5Q66T0153,,,  to any that if these people with thing
rvIfl5Q66T0153,,,  all this wishy washy snuggle I know what
rvIfl5Q66T0154,46,46.1,  to do this should make it clear ca n't
rvIfl5Q66T0154,,,  lie down if the audience doe n't because
rvIfl5Q66T0154,,,  if that 's what happens when you talk
rvIfl5Q66T0154,,,  about the situation when people put pop
rvIfl5Q66T0154,,,  up hard when they talk about something
rvIfl5Q66T0154,,,  else that 's not following the talking
rvIfl5Q66T0155,46.13,46.24,  about thing you 're showing do n't talk
rvIfl5Q66T0155,,,  about thing you love showing and no
rvIfl5Q66T0155,,,  joke thing that you 're not talking
rvIfl5Q66T0155,,,  about because that of course people are
rvIfl5Q66T0155,,,  not going to be that 's irrelevant I
rvIfl5Q66T0155,,,  do n't even know why people do it and
rvIfl5Q66T0156,46.26,46.39,  shoot me will do it sometimes why do you
rvIfl5Q66T0156,,,  seriously expect u to be able to read
rvIfl5Q66T0156,,,  and listen to pay attention to both do
rvIfl5Q66T0156,,,  you have an extra head for u to them

rvIfl5Q66T0157,,,  it in detail and I feel like they 're
rvIfl5Q66T0158,47.05,47.16,  doing good job because they talk about
rvIfl5Q66T0158,,,  stuff like pastel color are better for
rvIfl5Q66T0158,,,  background sharper color are better
rvIfl5Q66T0158,,,  for that and they address a lot of
rvIfl5Q66T0158,,,  technical stuff like that that I kind of
rvIfl5Q66T0158,,,  did n't want to go into because I knew
rvIfl5Q66T0159,47.17,47.3,  that this is what they 're covering in
rvIfl5Q66T0159,,,  part but the general rule is the pastel
