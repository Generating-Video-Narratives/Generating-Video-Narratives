MnIPpUiTcRc3,0.17,0.34,presentation at different point in our,No
nan,nan,nan,life that might be for school or work or,Structure
nan,nan,nan,an organization that you weren't,Structure

nan,nan,nan,"detail, you want to give the",Structure
nan,nan,nan,same presentation to a group of high,No
nan,nan,nan,school student who are interested in,No
nan,nan,nan,"entrepreneurship, that you went to a",No
nan,nan,nan,"roomful of startup, founder and CEOs,",Structure
nan,nan,nan,because their expectation and level of,No
nan,nan,nan,understanding will be on completely,Structure
nan,nan,nan,different level dig up a much a you,No
nan,nan,nan,can about who your audience. is. what,No
MnIPpUiTcRc8,1.01,1.05,industry they work in and what,No
nan,nan,nan,position they generally hold. This,No
MnIPpUiTcRc9,1.05,1.11,allows you to really tailor the content,No
nan,nan,nan,"and delivery of the presentation, in a",No
nan,nan,nan,way that will really make it stand out,No
nan,nan,nan,and be too many time.,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc10,1.13,1.23,People give killer presentation at one,No
nan,nan,nan,venue to a group made up of their core,Structure
nan,nan,nan,audience and then bomb on the same,No

MnIPpUiTcRc11,1.25,1.48,content will replicate the reaction with,No
nan,nan,nan,all Audience Number two use structure,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to build on idea If you stand up and,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"give a presentation, and all the point",No
nan,nan,nan,you want to make are just tossed around,No
nan,nan,nan,"randomly and they make any sense,",No
nan,nan,nan,not too many People are going to enjoy,No

nan,nan,nan,that each idea each section build on,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"the one before it, you help your audience.",No
MnIPpUiTcRc12,1.49,1.51,connect with the content and create,No
nan,nan,nan,logical link between the concept. This,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc13,1.51,2,is a great way to make more complex,Structure
nan,nan,nan,idea easier for the Audience to,No
nan,nan,nan,understand and remember,No
nan,nan,nan,number three use visuals another great,No
nan,nan,nan,tool to cement. Those idea in the mind,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc14,2,2.02,of your audience. is. to use visuals like,No
MnIPpUiTcRc15,2.02,2.06,chart graph and infographics to,No
nan,nan,nan,illustrate and communicate a concept. a,No
MnIPpUiTcRc16,2.06,2.1,many a 65 percent of People are,No
nan,nan,nan,considered to be visual learner. So if,No
MnIPpUiTcRc17,2.1,2.27,you take this approach in your,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation you are going to ignore the,No
nan,nan,nan,vast majority of the population using an,No
nan,nan,nan,"image, regardless of If it, a picture",No
nan,nan,nan,graph or chart can be a much more potent,No
nan,nan,nan,conveyor of information and ha a much,No
nan,nan,nan,more powerful impact on the Audience a,No
nan,nan,nan,single image can convey so much,No
nan,nan,nan,information just like the old saying,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that a picture worth a thousand word.,No
MnIPpUiTcRc18,2.29,2.35,It really is think of the impact This,No
nan,nan,nan,can have when explaining data or result,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"in a presentation, If you had to stand",No
nan,nan,nan,there in front of your audience. and go,No
MnIPpUiTcRc19,2.35,2.43,"through every data point verbally, it can",No
nan,nan,nan,get bad quickly and This is much more,No
nan,nan,nan,common of an occurrence than you might,Structure
nan,nan,nan,think But if you able to visualize,No
nan,nan,nan,that data for your audience. with a graph,No
MnIPpUiTcRc20,2.43,2.56,or chart you instantly make it much more,No
nan,nan,nan,"understandable and memorable, showing",No
nan,nan,nan,someone 200 percent growth with a graph,No
nan,nan,nan,is much more exciting than explaining it,No
nan,nan,nan,"while looking at the raw data,",No

nan,nan,nan,"This video and all you saw wa black, it",No

MnIPpUiTcRc21,2.56,3.21,repetition is your friend having a bit,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of structure in your presentation go a,Structure
nan,nan,nan,long way in keeping the Audience engaged,No
nan,nan,nan,because they can follow the information,No
nan,nan,nan,from step to step But even more than,No
nan,nan,nan,just structuring the flow of the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"presentation, you also want to build in",Structure
nan,nan,nan,repetition This encourages people to,Structure
nan,nan,nan,remember the key point of the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"presentation, and help it stick which",No
nan,nan,nan,again make it and you more memorable a,No
nan,nan,nan,classic way to go about repetition is,Structure
nan,nan,nan,something Dana learned early on when he,No
nan,nan,nan,started his public speaking career.,No
MnIPpUiTcRc22,3.23,3.26,Another speaker at a big regional tech,No
nan,nan,nan,event came up to him after a talk and,Structure
nan,nan,nan,complimented Dana on is. delivery in the,No
MnIPpUiTcRc23,3.26,3.36,depth of the material but asked why he,No
nan,nan,nan,use more repetition Dana wa a,No
nan,nan,nan,"bit stumped, because he never really",No
nan,nan,nan,thought about that before the Other,No
nan,nan,nan,speaker suggested that Dana start,No
nan,nan,nan,telling the Audience what it is. he,No
MnIPpUiTcRc24,3.36,3.44,wanted to tell them just to give them a,No
nan,nan,nan,brief rundown of the key point after,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that move right into the body of the,No
nan,nan,nan,"presentation, and tell them exactly what",Structure
nan,nan,nan,wa highlighted at the beginning. But,No
MnIPpUiTcRc25,3.44,3.53,"obviously, with more detail and extra",Structure
nan,nan,nan,element that you add in to make the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"presentation, stick then in the",No
nan,nan,nan,"presentation, by telling them what you",No
nan,nan,nan,"just told them, reminding them of the key",Structure
nan,nan,nan,point and a brief summary for final,Structure
nan,nan,nan,repetition. Using this technique help to,No
MnIPpUiTcRc26,3.55,3.58,reinforce the main point of the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"presentation, at least three time at the",No
nan,nan,nan,beginning. middle and end. The key is to,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc27,4,4,nan,No
MnIPpUiTcRc28,4,4.08,"find a way to do this, that it feel",No
nan,nan,nan,"natural and not overly scholastic, and",No
nan,nan,nan,that take practice which talk,No
nan,nan,nan,about later. On tip Number five have a,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc29,4.08,4.2,story to tell,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the difference between an average,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation that People zone out of and,No
nan,nan,nan,"a great presentation, that keep them",No
nan,nan,nan,engaged is how you convey the,No
nan,nan,nan,information to the Audience,No
nan,nan,nan,a great way to convey the information or,No
nan,nan,nan,key point of your presentation is. to,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc30,4.2,4.23,use a story,No
nan,nan,nan,using a story preferably an interesting,Structure
nan,nan,nan,one. You get your point across and you,No
MnIPpUiTcRc31,4.25,4.29,"creating a moment in the presentation,",Structure

MnIPpUiTcRc33,4.31,4.35,hopefully going to be something that,Structure
nan,nan,nan,catch their attention pulling them in,No
nan,nan,nan,to what you were saying. One of the key,No
MnIPpUiTcRc34,4.35,4.4,"here, though, is that it ha to be a story",Structure
nan,nan,nan,"you can tell with commitment, and it ha",Structure
nan,nan,nan,to be true always be honest with your,No
nan,nan,nan,audience. because because If you not,No
MnIPpUiTcRc35,4.42,4.45,they will know and you will have lost,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"all credibility, tip Number six. Be",Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc36,4.45,4.53,relatable being relatable is actually,Structure
nan,nan,nan,one of the most important factor of,Structure
nan,nan,nan,your delivery you want to be someone,No
nan,nan,nan,"that your audience. can relate to, But",No
MnIPpUiTcRc37,4.53,4.55,they would feel comfortable with talking,No
nan,nan,nan,to. Even when giving a talk a an expert,No
MnIPpUiTcRc38,4.56,5.06,"on a topic, you want the Audience to feel",No
nan,nan,nan,"the relation it help them mentally,",No

nan,nan,nan,most people do feel comfortable going,No
nan,nan,nan,up and talking to. a stern authority,No
MnIPpUiTcRc39,5.06,5.09,figure and no one want to listen to,No
nan,nan,nan,someone with no confidence. So there a,No
MnIPpUiTcRc40,5.09,5.16,"fine balance, you need a strike and",No
nan,nan,nan,"here, how the most important thing you",Structure
nan,nan,nan,can do to come across a more relatable,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"is to be authentic, be yourself. Another",No
MnIPpUiTcRc41,5.16,5.21,great way to accomplish this is to work,No
nan,nan,nan,on coming across a relaxed which can be,No
nan,nan,nan,difficult. If you not used to,No
MnIPpUiTcRc42,5.23,5.33,"presenting, but This go a long way to",Structure
nan,nan,nan,"helping people, see you a relatable the",No
nan,nan,nan,final way you can be a more relatable is,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to be enthusiastic about your,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation your enthusiasm will,No
nan,nan,nan,transfer to your audience. and now that,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc43,5.33,5.42,you have enthusiasm in common you will,No
nan,nan,nan,begin to see is more relatable If you,Structure
nan,nan,nan,get all three of these technique,No
nan,nan,nan,"mastered, you will be we'll On your way to",Structure
nan,nan,nan,"making it to your audience. relate to, you",No

MnIPpUiTcRc45,5.46,5.49,"with practice this might be the last tip,",No
nan,nan,nan,but it is. by far the most important one,Structure
MnIPpUiTcRc46,5.49,5.51,out of these seven confidence. and what,No
MnIPpUiTcRc47,5.51,5.54,you do is by far the most important,Structure
nan,nan,nan,element of your presentation having,Structure
nan,nan,nan,confidence. add an authority to,No
MnIPpUiTcRc48,5.56,6,everything you say during your,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation But you not going to,No
nan,nan,nan,develop the confidence. you need If you,No
MnIPpUiTcRc49,6,6.02,do practice and practice a lot.,No
MnIPpUiTcRc50,6.04,6.05,Whatever Dana give a talk or,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation he practice he say for,No
nan,nan,nan,hour. They want to make sure he,No
MnIPpUiTcRc51,6.08,6.11,ha the timing down that he know every,No
nan,nan,nan,"slide, so he have to read off",No
nan,nan,nan,"them. He know what the next slide is, So",No
MnIPpUiTcRc52,6.13,6.18,he can smoothly transition between them,No
nan,nan,nan,So that he will sound natural and,No
nan,nan,nan,"authentic, and can explain the concept.",No
MnIPpUiTcRc53,6.19,6.19,and tell the story with confidence. and,No
MnIPpUiTcRc54,6.19,6.35,This all come with practice when you,No
nan,nan,nan,"are practicing a presentation, it not",No
nan,nan,nan,enough to sit in front of your computer,No
nan,nan,nan,and go through it you have to practice,Structure
nan,nan,nan,it in front of Other people Invite some,No

nan,nan,nan,Most people who come to speak at TED are here because they ’ ve succeeded .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU2,0.13,0.13,I ’ m here because I haven ’ t .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU3,0.17,0.23,For the last ten year,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I ’ ve been helping conference speaker business leader entrepreneur,No
nan,nan,nan,to prepare and deliver powerful presentation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU4,0.27,0.3,And in those same ten year TED ha shown,No
nan,nan,nan,that presentation can and should be both enjoyable and effective .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU5,0.37,0.47,But ten year on,Structure
nan,nan,nan,despite TED and despite my best effort at school conference and company,No
nan,nan,nan,most presentation still do this to their audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU6,0.53,0.55,So have I failed ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,No ! I just have n't succeeded yet .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU7,0.59,1.04,And to succeed in making all presentation resonate with their audience,No
nan,nan,nan,I need your help .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU8,1.06,1.06,That ’ s why I ’ m here .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU9,1.08,1.09,So I ’ d like to share with you,No
nan,nan,nan,the three magic ingredient of powerful presentation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU10,1.15,1.15,OK let ’ s just pause there for a moment .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU11,1.18,1.18,I ’ ve told you what I ’ m going to say .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU12,1.21,1.31,The question you should be asking is :,Structure
nan,nan,nan, So what ? What ’ s in it for me ? Why should I care ? '',No
nan,nan,nan,And that is a really important question,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because the first magic ingredient is in fact the audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU13,1.36,1.36,The audience is the magic ingredient in every presentation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU14,1.39,1.39,This is not my talk it ’ s yours .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU15,1.42,1.45,Every presentation should be made to measure,No
nan,nan,nan,for a specific audience in a specific context .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU16,1.49,1.58,So why should you care about the magic ingredient of great presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well it 's very important right ?,No
nan,nan,nan,It ’ s really important to understand that we all have to listen to presentation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU17,2.03,2.18,Wouldn ’ t it be great if they weren ’ t all so boring ?,No
nan,nan,nan,But we don ’ t just listen to presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,we also have to give presentations right ?,No
nan,nan,nan,How many of you ever have to give presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,I think if we ’ re honest we all do .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU18,2.21,2.32,Sooner or later at school or at work,No
nan,nan,nan,and also in interview,No
nan,nan,nan,we all have to present with or without slide,No
nan,nan,nan,and it ’ s how well we present,No
nan,nan,nan,that will make a huge difference to how well we succeed .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU19,2.36,2.36,That ’ s why you should care .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU20,2.39,2.39,So that ’ s the first magic ingredient : the audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU21,2.42,2.42,Always make it special for them .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU22,2.46,2.46,The second magic ingredient is the speaker .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU23,2.5,2.52,Now you ’ re probably looking at me and thinking :,No
nan,nan,nan,“ Well Phil not very magical . ”,No
yoD8RMq2OkU24,2.52,3.02,Thanks by the way !,No
nan,nan,nan,But it ’ s really important that you put something of yourself in there,Structure
nan,nan,nan,something only you can say .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU25,3.05,3.14,This doesn ’ t mean you tell them what you had for breakfast,No
nan,nan,nan,but it doe mean that if someone else,Structure
nan,nan,nan,could give the exact same presentation in your place,No
nan,nan,nan,then you didn ’ t put anything personal into it .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU26,3.16,3.2,And that matter because when you share,No
nan,nan,nan,we care .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU27,3.21,3.21,So show why you care why it ’ s important to you .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU28,3.25,3.25,Tell u example and story from your experience .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU29,3.29,3.29,And that will make it more personal and more memorable .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU30,3.33,3.36,So those are the first two magic ingredient :,No
nan,nan,nan,the audience and the speaker .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU31,3.38,3.41,I know it doesn ’ t sound very magical,No
nan,nan,nan,but you ’ d be amazed how many presentation have neither of them .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU32,3.46,3.46,So the third magic ingredient is transformation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU33,3.5,3.56,Now most presentation aim only to inform their audience,No
nan,nan,nan,and it doesn ’ t work very well .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU34,3.58,4.05,Let me take out my magic wand because I ’ m going to do a disappearing trick,No
nan,nan,nan,because like this guy,No
nan,nan,nan,we forget most of what we hear very quickly indeed .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU35,4.11,4.15,But good presentation are not about information,No
nan,nan,nan,they are about transformation .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU36,4.17,4.22,They are about changing something in what your audience belief,No
nan,nan,nan,in what they feel in what they do .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU37,4.25,4.28,Imagine you are making a pitch,Structure
nan,nan,nan,for raising fund for a project or a start .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU38,4.32,4.36,After your pitch the audience know everything they need to know,No
nan,nan,nan,but they don ’ t fund you .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU39,4.38,4.39,Did you succeed ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,No .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU40,4.41,4.53,Now imagine that after your pitch your audience doe give you the fund,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because they feel confident and trusting,No
nan,nan,nan,and they believe that your project will be successful,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and that it is a good investment .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU41,4.55,4.55,All of that is not information it ’ s transformation .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU42,5,5.05,So it ’ s easy for me to say “ Don ’ t inform transform ! ”,No
nan,nan,nan,but how ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Well every magician need a magic wand and here is yours .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU43,5.1,5.1,It ’ s called the  Audience Transformation Roadmap . '',Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU44,5.1,5.26,This is a really simple but amazingly powerful technique,No
nan,nan,nan,to understand what your transformational objective are,No
nan,nan,nan,and then to brainstorm,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what you can say show and do to transform your audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU45,5.3,5.3,So here ’ s how it work .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU46,5.33,5.37,To understand how to take your audience on a transformational journey,No
nan,nan,nan,you first need to work out where they are starting from .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU47,5.4,5.57,So we ask ourselves four simple question :,No
nan,nan,nan,What doe my audience know before my presentation ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,What do they know about the subject ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,What do they believe ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,And what do they feel ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Now the difference between the two,No
nan,nan,nan,is believing is something you think and feeling is an emotion .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU48,6,6.04,So for example I believe it ’ s time for dinner,No
nan,nan,nan,I feel hungry .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU49,6.06,6.07,See the difference ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Right .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU50,6.08,6.16,So what do they know believe and feel and lastly what do they do ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Now this could be nothing maybe they do nothing relevant,No
nan,nan,nan,or maybe they do something that you need to change .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU51,6.21,6.23,So once you ’ ve worked out where they are before,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you can then take them to where you want them to go afterwards .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU52,6.26,6.26,And we ask the same four question but in the reverse order .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU53,6.31,6.31,So now we know what they do before .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU54,6.32,6.52,What do we want them to do after the presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,What do they need to feel ?,No
nan,nan,nan,What should they believe differently to feel and do those thing ?,No
nan,nan,nan,And lastly what do they need to know ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,And when you follow this process,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you realize very quickly that the real transformation,No
nan,nan,nan,are not in what they know it ’ s in what they believe and feel and do .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU55,6.56,6.56,That ’ s what make the difference .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU56,6.59,7.1,Once we ’ ve understood where they are and where we need to take them,Structure
nan,nan,nan,then we can fill in the Transformation Column,No
nan,nan,nan,with all of the idea on what we can say in our presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,to make those transformation in our audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU57,7.13,7.13,And that give u the content of the presentation .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU58,7.17,7.3,Clear so far ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Maybe we should take an example so let ’ s take one !,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Let ’ s assume that I am going to make a presentation,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and I 'd like to explain the three magic ingredient of a great presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,and I ’ d like to make my audience want to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU59,7.35,7.43,So what doe my audience know before the presentation ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Well they know that most presentation aren ’ t exactly successful,No
nan,nan,nan,and they know TED is the exception that prof that rule .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU60,7.47,7.48,What do they believe ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Probably like most people they believe presentation are for sharing information .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU61,7.53,7.53,It might be wrong but that doesn ’ t stop them believing it .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU62,7.57,8.05,What do they feel about presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Probably bored but also resigned to a really ineffective way of presenting,No
nan,nan,nan,because that ’ s just what everyone doe .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU63,8.08,8.15,And lastly what do they do ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Well when it ’ s their turn to present,No
nan,nan,nan,they generally will pack thing full of information,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and they won ’ t personalize it to their audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU64,8.18,8.27,So what do I want them to do after my presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well afterwards I ’ m going to want them,No
nan,nan,nan,to aim to transform their audience every time they present,No
nan,nan,nan,to change something in their audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU65,8.29,8.29,I ’ m going to need them to personalize their presentation every time .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU66,8.34,8.38,And also I ’ d like them to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap,No
nan,nan,nan,because I know it will help them to succeed .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU67,8.42,8.45,What do they need to feel to do those thing ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well If they still feel bored or resigned they ’ re not going to do very much .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU68,8.49,8.55,So they need to feel curious about this new technique,No
nan,nan,nan,they need to feel motivated to try it,No
nan,nan,nan,and optimistic that it can work for them .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU69,8.58,9.03,What do they need to believe to feel those thing ?,No
nan,nan,nan,They ’ ll need to believe that the Roadmap,Structure
nan,nan,nan,can actually help them to succeed in their presentation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU70,9.06,9.1,Lastly what do they need to know to believe feel and do those thing ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well they ’ ll need to know the three magic ingredient that ’ s pretty basic .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU71,9.14,9.17,They 'll need to know presentation are bad at information,No
nan,nan,nan,but great at transformation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU72,9.19,9.19,And they ’ ll need to know how to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU73,9.24,9.24,OK now we ’ ve worked out where they were and where I want to take them .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU74,9.29,9.29,What can I do now ? I fill in the Transformation Column .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU75,9.32,9.38,So what can I say or show or do to make those transformation ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Now usually I ’ m using a flip and some sticky note here .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU76,9.43,9.43,So I ’ m going to use virtual sticky note .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU77,9.45,9.45,Let ’ s start at the top .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU78,9.47,9.53,We need to make sure they know the three magic ingredient,No
nan,nan,nan,so I ’ m going to need to talk at some point about the audience,Structure
nan,nan,nan,about the speaker and the transformation .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU79,9.56,9.59,They need to know presentation are bad at information,No
nan,nan,nan,so maybe I should tell them that we forget most of what we hear very quickly .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU80,10.03,10.03,And perhaps I can find a visual way to show that a well .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU81,10.08,10.12,What next ? They need to know how to use the Roadmap so I ’ d better show it to them,No
nan,nan,nan,and I guess I could make it even clearer by going through an example .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU82,10.16,10.17,They need to believe,No
nan,nan,nan,that the Roadmap can help them to succeed in their presentation .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU83,10.21,10.3,So I ’ ll need to show how easy it is,No
nan,nan,nan,to take all of these sticky note off of the Transformation Column,No
nan,nan,nan,and arrange them in a suitable order,No
nan,nan,nan,to create the storyline for their presentation .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU84,10.32,10.32,It really is a short .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU85,10.34,10.34,OK now I need to make them curious .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU86,10.36,10.4,Now to make them curious I ’ m going to need to make them care,No
nan,nan,nan,and to make them care I need to show that I care .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU87,10.43,10.48,So I probably need to explain that most presentation really don ’ t succeed,No
nan,nan,nan,and that I care about fixing that .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU88,10.51,10.53,And then to make them care,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I ’ m going to need to find out how relevant it is to them .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU89,10.57,11.01,Perhaps I could ask them how many of them actually need to present,No
nan,nan,nan,and of course I know the answer is pretty much everybody .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU90,11.04,11.04,I need to make them motivated and optimistic .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU91,11.06,11.1,Well I can make them optimistic by explaining how easy this is to use,No
nan,nan,nan,but also how powerful it is .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU92,11.12,11.18,And to motivate them to try it,No
nan,nan,nan,I ’ m going to need to explain that successful presentation,Structure
nan,nan,nan,can really make a difference to how well they succeed in life .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU93,11.24,11.27,Lastly to make them do these thing I ’ ll need a call to action,Structure
nan,nan,nan,which focus on what I want them to do afterwards .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU94,11.31,11.36,So there we have it !,Structure
nan,nan,nan,That ’ s a very accelerated version of the brainstorming,No
nan,nan,nan,but it doesn ’ t need to take long .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU95,11.38,11.42,What we have now is just enough relevant idea,Structure
nan,nan,nan,on how we can transform our audience .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU96,11.45,11.5,So what happens next ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Well this is where I ’ m going to take my magic wand out again,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because this is where the presentation magic happens .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU97,11.52,12.09,This is where you can take all the sticky note off of the Transformation Column,Structure
nan,nan,nan,prepare a suitably magical story line,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then arrange all of these idea back into that story line,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and hey presto there is my presentation !,No
nan,nan,nan,Now you might recognize this one because ...,No
yoD8RMq2OkU98,12.12,12.12,this is the presentation you have been watching for the last ten minute .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU99,12.17,12.17,And this is where we are now .,Structure
yoD8RMq2OkU100,12.2,12.25,Isn ’ t that magic ?,No
nan,nan,nan,So now you know what happens next !,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Next I need to explain how simple this can be and how powerful .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU101,12.29,12.29,And it ’ s so simple that it doesn ’ t take an expert .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU102,12.32,12.39,Thousands of people have already used this technique,No
nan,nan,nan,to prepare and deliver fantastic presentation of all kind,No
nan,nan,nan,from TED talk to the boardroom .,No
yoD8RMq2OkU103,12.42,12.55,But more than presentation they ’ ve used it also for email,No
nan,nan,nan,for proposal for preparing interview for preparing conference …,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Basically it work in any situation,No
nan,nan,nan,where you need to change what people believe feel and do .,No

wp4ho9raVjA47,6,6.12,something different a handy trick to,No
nan,nan,nan,overcome this lack of focus is by,No
nan,nan,nan,changing the scene and showing a video,No

nan,nan,nan,you,No
d812a7qG9Kw1,0,0.02,The way you practice a presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,directly influence the outcome .,No
d812a7qG9Kw2,0.05,0.06,So in this video we 're going to talk about,Structure
nan,nan,nan,how to practice a speech .,No
d812a7qG9Kw3,0.09,0.09,Let 's get into those detail .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw4,0.15,0.15,Hello there friend .,No
d812a7qG9Kw5,0.16,0.2,Alex Lyon and we are at the end of a three series,Structure
nan,nan,nan,on public speaking this month .,No
d812a7qG9Kw6,0.22,0.22,The first video is on the importance of public speaking .,No
d812a7qG9Kw7,0.24,0.27,The one before this is on how to improve,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and this one is specifically on how to practice a speech .,No
d812a7qG9Kw8,0.3,0.39,So let 's get into the five way,No
nan,nan,nan,that I recommend you practicing a speech,No
nan,nan,nan,and at the end of this video you may wan na stick around,No
nan,nan,nan,because I have a couple of resource to suggest,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to help you move your public speaking to the next level .,No
d812a7qG9Kw9,0.42,0.44,So the first way to practice a speech,No
nan,nan,nan,is to practice from an outline .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw10,0.48,0.48,Not word for word note .,No
d812a7qG9Kw11,0.5,0.51,I 've given some version of this tip,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in a lot of different video but let 's say it clearly .,No
d812a7qG9Kw12,0.54,1.01,You must practice from an outline a bare bone outline,No
nan,nan,nan,if you want to sound conversational,No
nan,nan,nan,which is really what your listener want from you .,No
d812a7qG9Kw13,1.03,1.06,They do n't want you to read your speech,No
nan,nan,nan,they do n't want you to sound like you 've memorized it .,No
d812a7qG9Kw14,1.08,1.08,They want a conversation .,No
d812a7qG9Kw15,1.09,1.09,And the way to get there is this .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw16,1.11,1.25,You take whatever note you have to prepare at first,No
nan,nan,nan,your first few draft,No
nan,nan,nan,and then you just keep cutting them down over and over again,Structure
nan,nan,nan,every time you practice,No
nan,nan,nan,until all you 're left with is a bulleted outline,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of your key point that you are going to hit .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw17,1.27,1.27,That 's all you really want in the end .,No
d812a7qG9Kw18,1.29,1.32,And that way you have a safety net to fall back on,No
nan,nan,nan,so you wo n't ever lose your place .,No
d812a7qG9Kw19,1.34,1.37,You can just glance down at your note,No
nan,nan,nan,and then bounce your eye right back up,No
nan,nan,nan,and present from an outline .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw20,1.39,1.39,That 's the best way .,No
d812a7qG9Kw21,1.4,1.41,Practice from an outline,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and in the end present like an outline .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw22,1.43,1.53,One of the thing I will do in fact is,Structure
nan,nan,nan,so I do n't sound like I 've memorized it,No
nan,nan,nan,I do n't sound like a robot,No
nan,nan,nan,is every time I practice,No
nan,nan,nan,I might say it a little differently on purpose,No
nan,nan,nan,so that I 'm not tempted to memorize .,No
d812a7qG9Kw23,1.55,1.55,So do n't try to put it word for word do n't try to memorize .,No
d812a7qG9Kw24,1.59,1.59,Talking point only and practice from that kind of outline .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw25,2.02,2.04,The number two tip on how to practice,No
nan,nan,nan,is to spread out your practice session over time .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw26,2.08,2.08,Do n't cram the night before .,No
d812a7qG9Kw27,2.1,2.1,Do n't cram the morning before your presentation .,No
d812a7qG9Kw28,2.13,2.15,I recommend spreading your practice session out,No
nan,nan,nan,over three day .,No
d812a7qG9Kw29,2.16,2.2,The idea is to practice about three time each day,No
nan,nan,nan,over those three day .,No
d812a7qG9Kw30,2.21,2.25,I like to practice about 10 time,No
nan,nan,nan,before I stand up and speak,No
nan,nan,nan,and it 's really easier to do if you spread it out .,No
d812a7qG9Kw31,2.28,2.3,A lot of great thing happen,Structure
nan,nan,nan,when you spread out your practice session .,No
d812a7qG9Kw32,2.32,2.32,The first thing that happens to me is it calm me down .,No
d812a7qG9Kw33,2.35,2.35,It say to me hey there 's time .,No
d812a7qG9Kw34,2.37,2.41,So if my earliest few practice session practice time,No
nan,nan,nan,do n't go so well I say hey there 's time .,No
d812a7qG9Kw35,2.43,2.43,No problem I got a few more day .,No
d812a7qG9Kw36,2.44,2.44,I 'll work out these kink .,No
d812a7qG9Kw37,2.46,2.49,Another great thing that happens is,Structure
nan,nan,nan,let 's say I 've practiced it three time,No
nan,nan,nan,and then I sleep on it .,No
d812a7qG9Kw38,2.51,2.59,Oftentimes in the middle of the day,No
nan,nan,nan,I 'm doing other thing I 'm washing dish,No
nan,nan,nan,my brain keep working on it,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and keep figuring out better way to say something,No
nan,nan,nan,or a quicker way to get to the point .,No
d812a7qG9Kw39,3.01,3.06,So in that downtime I believe that our brain,No
nan,nan,nan,are still working on it,No
nan,nan,nan,and we benefit from that downtime a well .,No
d812a7qG9Kw40,3.08,3.12,The other great thing about breaking up,Structure
nan,nan,nan,your practice session is it help me,No
nan,nan,nan,with my composure in the moment .,No
d812a7qG9Kw41,3.14,3.18,Because it feel to me like muscle memory with an athlete,No
nan,nan,nan,that I 've done this before .,No
d812a7qG9Kw42,3.2,3.2,I 've been doing this presentation for day .,No
d812a7qG9Kw43,3.22,3.22,So it really help me stay composed and in the moment .,No
d812a7qG9Kw44,3.25,3.28,So spread out those practice session three time a day,No
nan,nan,nan,over three day .,No
d812a7qG9Kw45,3.29,3.29,That usually is about what you need .,No
d812a7qG9Kw46,3.31,3.36,The number three tip is to focus,No
nan,nan,nan,on only one or two improvement,No
nan,nan,nan,each time you practice it through .,No
d812a7qG9Kw47,3.39,3.41,So you might just work on your structure and your outline,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in the first few time through that 's normal .,No
d812a7qG9Kw48,3.44,3.48,The next few time through just pick one or two thing,No
nan,nan,nan,like oh now I 'm just gon na work on looking up,No
nan,nan,nan,form my outline eye contact for example .,No
d812a7qG9Kw49,3.5,3.53,The next time through you might just work on gesture,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and your posture a little bit .,No
d812a7qG9Kw50,3.54,4.14,Every time you practice,No
nan,nan,nan,add one or two thing you wan na improve on,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because when you add too many thing all at once,Structure
nan,nan,nan,when you try to get it perfect every time you practice,No
nan,nan,nan,you 're going to get paralyzed,No
nan,nan,nan,because you ca n't really improve more than one thing,No
nan,nan,nan,or maybe two thing in any given practice session,No
nan,nan,nan,so focus on improvement,No
nan,nan,nan,and then start checking those off the list .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw51,4.16,4.18,And then your fundamental will all be in place,Structure
nan,nan,nan,by the time you actually stand up to present .,No
d812a7qG9Kw52,4.21,4.21,Number four tip is to keep practice session realistic .,No
d812a7qG9Kw53,4.26,4.29,Do not for example the whole time you 're practicing,No
nan,nan,nan,isolate yourself completely and make condition perfect .,No
d812a7qG9Kw54,4.34,4.37,Because what end up happening in the moment,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of your actual presentation is it wo n't go perfectly .,No
d812a7qG9Kw55,4.39,4.45,People will walk in late,No
nan,nan,nan,or they 'll get up to use the bathroom,No
nan,nan,nan,or there 'll be somebody,Structure
nan,nan,nan,with a lawn mower outside your window .,No
d812a7qG9Kw56,4.47,4.52,In fact I 've been recording this morning,No
nan,nan,nan,and there is a neighbor working with a chainsaw nearby,No
nan,nan,nan,that keep distracting me but you just power through it .,No
d812a7qG9Kw57,4.55,4.59,So after a few time practicing alone,No
nan,nan,nan,what I end up doing when I practice,No
nan,nan,nan,is I add distraction on purpose .,No
d812a7qG9Kw58,5.02,5.14,Like I will put the television or some music on,No
nan,nan,nan,and then I 'll talk over that,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because it creates a little bit of noise,No
nan,nan,nan,and distraction for me to cope with,No
nan,nan,nan,and I know that if I can practice through those distraction,No
nan,nan,nan,that during the actual moment I 'll be ready to push through .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw59,5.17,5.18,Even if something weird or odd happens,No
nan,nan,nan,it wo n't throw me off a much .,No
d812a7qG9Kw60,5.2,5.2,So keep practice session realistic .,No
d812a7qG9Kw61,5.23,5.28,And the number five tip is to visualize the first 30 second,No
nan,nan,nan,and the last 30 second of your presentation .,No
d812a7qG9Kw62,5.3,5.3,So by visualization I mean the way a sport athlete doe it .,No
d812a7qG9Kw63,5.34,5.4,So you picture yourself walking up,No
nan,nan,nan,through that first 30 second of the moment,No
nan,nan,nan,starting off your presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,and then the last 30 second how you 're gon na close .,Structure
d812a7qG9Kw64,5.43,5.43,So athlete do this with great success .,No
d812a7qG9Kw65,5.46,5.55,There is a study by Laure Ecard published in the 1980s,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and a lot of other study like it,No
nan,nan,nan,on basketball free throw shooting,No
nan,nan,nan,and they found people that only visualized,No
nan,nan,nan,actually did improve a little bit .,No
d812a7qG9Kw66,5.57,6,People who practiced free throw basketball free throw,No
nan,nan,nan,improved a little more .,No
d812a7qG9Kw67,6.01,6.05,But athlete who did both,No
nan,nan,nan,they visualized and they practiced,No
nan,nan,nan,did the most improvement out of any of the group .,No
d812a7qG9Kw68,6.08,6.15,So by visualizing the first 30 second and last 30 second,No
nan,nan,nan,you 're going to be boosting,No
nan,nan,nan,your overall performance up quite a bit,No
nan,nan,nan,even if you do n't get to practice it a few extra session .,No
d812a7qG9Kw69,6.18,6.2,So those are the five tip I recommend,No
nan,nan,nan,in term of how to practice for a speech .,No
d812a7qG9Kw70,6.22,6.28,These are the one I use personally,No
nan,nan,nan,and I have coached a lot of people over the year,No
nan,nan,nan,to use them and they really do work,No
nan,nan,nan,so put them into practice a soon a possible .,No
d812a7qG9Kw71,6.3,6.33,So I mentioned a couple of resource at the beginning,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I wanted to tell you about that are for you .,No
d812a7qG9Kw72,6.35,6.35,The first one is a free PDF download .,No
d812a7qG9Kw73,6.38,6.4,It 's instant tip to make you a more confident,No

d812a7qG9Kw75,6.46,6.46,It 's a PDF download .,No
d812a7qG9Kw76,6.47,6.5,The second resource is a full course that I have created,Structure

UOceysteIjo53,6.17,6.23,But also remember just don ’ t read those card it 's gon na be a good a reading your,No
nan,nan,nan,slide . Come on you need to smile everyone know,No
UOceysteIjo54,6.23,6.27,you are nervous Giving presentation is nerve . So make sure you are smiling and make an effort,No
UOceysteIjo55,6.27,6.34,to make eye with people . Practice meeting your audience 's eye while rehearsing,No
UOceysteIjo56,6.34,6.4,and it ’ ll feel a lot more normal in the big presentation . This would project you a,No
UOceysteIjo57,6.4,6.45,a warm and friendly person and your audience would be also at ease .,No
UOceysteIjo58,6.55,7.02,Using PowerPoint ? Well you ’ re not the only one – Do you know ? There are around 350,No
nan,nan,nan,PowerPoint presentation given every second across the world . And what do you think are,No
UOceysteIjo59,7.02,7.07,they effective enough ? They aren ’ t that effective . Immediately after a ten minute,No
UOceysteIjo60,7.07,7.13,presentation only 50 % of the fact can be recalled . By the next day only 23 % is retained,No
UOceysteIjo61,7.13,7.19,and 7 day later just 10 % of the information . You know this human mind ha it own limit,No
UOceysteIjo62,7.19,7.26,and it can only hold on to between three and or say maximum seven point .,Structure
UOceysteIjo63,7.31,7.31,You should aim for three main point and your presentation would be remembered . ALSO AVOID,No
UOceysteIjo64,7.31,7.36,BIG WALLS OF TEXT . This is a common mistake a lot of presenter make with their PowerPoint,No
UOceysteIjo65,7.36,7.41,slide . I know it ’ s tempting to stick every item of information on your slide . However,No
UOceysteIjo66,7.41,7.41,nan,No
UOceysteIjo67,7.41,7.53,this will intimidate your audience and the recall value of your presentation would be,No
nan,nan,nan,limited . Now if you have too much text on your slide that would force you to turn your,No
UOceysteIjo68,7.53,7.59,back to the audience which is a big no in all form of public interaction . So guy,No
UOceysteIjo69,7.59,8.05,Keep your slide brief and let the audience keep the attention on you .,No
UOceysteIjo70,8.14,8.19,Rather than focusing your mind on your presentation and how you ’ re gon na do it think about,No
nan,nan,nan,the message that you are gon na give . You ’ ll come across a a lot more passionate and interested,No
UOceysteIjo71,8.19,8.25,and would give yourself an expert presenter status a well . You ’ ll also make fewer mistake,No
UOceysteIjo72,8.25,8.31,because you won ’ t be flustered . Define the purpose of your presentation . Before you start,No
UOceysteIjo73,8.31,8.31,nan,No
UOceysteIjo74,8.31,8.37,designing your presentation ask yourself what 's the purpose of your talk is . In general,Structure
UOceysteIjo75,8.37,8.43,you ’ re either informing persuading or building a goodwill .,Structure
UOceysteIjo76,8.47,9,So think about it : are you sharing your expertise giving a step workshop do you want,No
nan,nan,nan,people to buy your product or service are you motivating people educating them are,No
nan,nan,nan,you presenting case is it purely entertainment . Now these are just some main,No
UOceysteIjo77,9,9.06,theme you could build your talk or presentation around .,Structure
UOceysteIjo78,9.09,9.21,One of the best public speaking tip I have learned is to make sure that you ’ re only,No
nan,nan,nan,gon na cover 1 main topic and just stay away from adding anything else you might want to,No
nan,nan,nan,share . Although it might be important a well it just take away the power of your presentation .,No
UOceysteIjo79,9.21,9.21,nan,No
UOceysteIjo80,9.27,9.43,Now what do I mean by this For example This video is about How could you improve your,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation skill Well designing a good presentation is an important part of presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,skill However my main goal is to introduce you to important hack for delivering a good,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation and not how you could write a good presentation . I will certainly do that,No
UOceysteIjo81,9.43,9.49,in some other video . But In this video my main topic is How to deliver great presentation,No
UOceysteIjo82,9.49,9.56,And I am gon na just stick to that only that ’ s my main topic . Although I might share a few,No
UOceysteIjo83,9.56,10.01,highlight about designing a presentation but that ’ s not my main topic . You need to,No
UOceysteIjo84,10.01,10.07,draw an outline of your talk so you have a framework to start with . Because if you,Structure
UOceysteIjo85,10.07,10.13,don ’ t know the main purpose of your talk no in the audience will . So always define,No
UOceysteIjo86,10.13,10.19,the purpose of your presentation .,No
UOceysteIjo87,10.26,10.26,Hey ! Slow Down ... . Its not a RACE ... .,No
UOceysteIjo88,10.26,10.26,nan,No
UOceysteIjo89,10.28,10.45,Focusing on speaking slowly should be one of the most important thing in your talk,No
nan,nan,nan,because you are speaking for an audience where not everyone is an expert on the topic possibly,No
nan,nan,nan,quite a few people have English a their second or even third language and it really just,No
nan,nan,nan,take time for people to let new information sink in .,Structure
UOceysteIjo90,10.5,10.5,PRACTICE SPEAKING SLOWLY For some reason people talk faster onstage . I remember my,No
UOceysteIjo91,10.5,10.57,bos always told me to speak so slowly until the point it get uncomfortable . That will,No
UOceysteIjo92,10.57,11.04,be the perfect tempo for the audience . I promise it ’ s gon na feel weird initially .,No
UOceysteIjo93,11.04,11.04,nan,No
UOceysteIjo94,11.1,11.26,But what ’ s weirder : speaking a lot slower than usual or stumbling over your # word,No
nan,nan,nan,and confusing your listener ? There ’ s one more way you could learn to speak slower,No
nan,nan,nan,listen carefully to each and every word that you say only say the next word when you have,No
nan,nan,nan,listened to the first one clearly . It would help you to certainly slow down your speaking,No
UOceysteIjo95,11.26,11.31,speed and be clearer with your word and pronunciation .,No
UOceysteIjo96,11.4,11.47,Why do phrase like “ Once upon a time… ” or,No
nan,nan,nan,“ In a land far away… ” immediately grab our attention ? Because those phrase tell,No
nan,nan,nan,you you ’ re about to hear a story and story are incredible communication tool . When you,No
UOceysteIjo97,11.47,12,tell story in your presentation they challenge our intellect stimulate our imagination,No
nan,nan,nan,and touch our emotion . Why everyone doe love a good story ? Because story communicate,No
UOceysteIjo98,12,12.06,idea and information that no other medium can .,No
UOceysteIjo99,12.1,12.22,Now No matter where you tell a story it could be around a campfire when you are on a picnic,No
nan,nan,nan,it could be by the water cooler in the office or in a courtroom or even in an auditorium,No
nan,nan,nan,while giving presentation . The impact of a story always remains the same : When you,Structure
UOceysteIjo100,12.22,12.35,tell a story start strong be engaging capture the interest of your audience and get them,Structure
nan,nan,nan,thinking with an impactful story related to your presentation .,No
UOceysteIjo101,12.38,12.45,Look through for anywhere that you can add in story or a really good or relevant image,Structure
nan,nan,nan,from where you could build the stage for telling your story . Story telling will make your presentation,Structure
UOceysteIjo102,12.45,12.56,seem realistic a well a help your presentation to flow naturally and increase the retention,No
nan,nan,nan,of your presentation by a minimum 65 % . So learn the art of storytelling it certainly work .,No
UOceysteIjo103,12.56,12.56,nan,No
UOceysteIjo104,13.08,13.08,Listening to a presentation for any length of time can be a difficult process . If the,No
UOceysteIjo105,13.08,13.22,talk doesn ’ t engage their attention the audience will start to feel distanced from,No
nan,nan,nan,your presentation they will start to lose track of the flow of information and eventually,Structure
nan,nan,nan,fail to absorb your idea and insight . To engage an audience fully the presentation,No
UOceysteIjo106,13.22,13.35,need to be energetic purposeful and staged a if it is a direct conversation between,No
nan,nan,nan,you and the audience . Direct interaction with the audience is harder a most presentation,No
UOceysteIjo107,13.35,13.47,are one only but if you can find a way to get your audience to DO something like,No
nan,nan,nan,a activity chance are they will remember what you said much better .,No
UOceysteIjo108,13.52,13.57,The activity doesn ’ t have to take long but just let your audience member speak up,No
nan,nan,nan,or speak to each other for about a minute . To give an example I can recall a presentation,No
UOceysteIjo109,13.57,14.09,I attended where the speaker asked the audience to close their eye for a second and think,Structure
nan,nan,nan,about their first travel experience . And then to turn to the person sitting next and share,No
UOceysteIjo110,14.09,14.16,the travel experience . Very simple but so powerful a the rest of the presentation,No
UOceysteIjo111,14.16,14.22,wa all about powerful travel story .,No
UOceysteIjo112,14.26,14.26,Involving your audience is essential to making an impact . Your presentation should pull them,No
UOceysteIjo113,14.26,14.31,in get their attention and stimulate their thought and understanding . The way that you,No
UOceysteIjo114,14.31,14.42,deliver your presentation should create a bond with your audience and ensure that the,No
nan,nan,nan,audience receive a positive message about you and your presentation .,No
UOceysteIjo115,14.47,14.47,The single most important thing to remember is that there is no one good way to do a presentation .,No
UOceysteIjo116,14.53,14.59,The most memorable presentation always offer something fresh something no one ha seen,No
nan,nan,nan,before . So do not on any account try to emulate every piece of advice I ’ ve offered here .,No
UOceysteIjo117,14.59,14.59,nan,No
UOceysteIjo118,15.03,15.03,Take the bulk of it on board but make the presentation your own . You know what ’ s distinctive,No

nan,nan,nan,paraphrasing is so by the end of today s,No
nan,nan,nan,"session, you ll know about why we use",No
nan,nan,nan,reference. The difference between quote,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI3,0.21,0.32,and paraphrasing and how to paraphrase,No
nan,nan,nan,"so, there are three main reason why it s",No
nan,nan,nan,important to reference. in your,No
5utoLhjUuAI4,0.32,0.32,assignment.,No
5utoLhjUuAI5,0.35,0.37,"First of all, reference can help to",Structure
nan,nan,nan,validate your point of view. So if you re,No
5utoLhjUuAI6,0.37,0.45,making a claim or an argument about,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"anything in particular, it s always",No
nan,nan,nan,important to use evidence to make that a,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"stronger argument. Okay, the next reason",No
5utoLhjUuAI7,0.45,0.49,is plagiarism. It s very easy to,No
5utoLhjUuAI8,0.49,0.51,accidentally plagiarize in your work. So,No
5utoLhjUuAI9,0.51,0.54,if you understand how to reference.,No
5utoLhjUuAI10,0.56,0.59,"correctly, you ll avoid plagiarizing the",No
nan,nan,nan,last thing it s a source of future,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"investigation. So, for example, if anyone",Structure
5utoLhjUuAI11,1.01,1.05,read your work. and they re interested,No
5utoLhjUuAI12,1.05,1.1,to find out more about what this person,No
nan,nan,nan,"ha said, they can go away and they can",No
nan,nan,nan,locate that information. They can locate,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI13,1.1,1.38,"that source So, there s two way future",Structure
nan,nan,nan,reference in quoting and,No
nan,nan,nan,paraphrasing,No
nan,nan,nan,a quotation is when you copy a piece of,Structure
nan,nan,nan,text word from a book or,No
nan,nan,nan,another type of source you should keep,Structure
nan,nan,nan,these to an absolute minimum at,No
nan,nan,nan,University we re looking to see that,No
nan,nan,nan,you re paraphrasing rather than just,No
nan,nan,nan,copying lengthy text from somebody,No
nan,nan,nan,"else. S work, so a I just mentioned, do",No
5utoLhjUuAI14,1.4,1.48,not have them too long that will eat,No
nan,nan,nan,into your word count and ultimately it,No
nan,nan,nan,"will affect the mark that you ll get. So,",Structure
5utoLhjUuAI15,1.48,1.53,paraphrasing is what we re looking to,No
nan,nan,nan,see that you re doing your assignment.,No
5utoLhjUuAI16,1.54,1.56,"However, anything is when you look at",No
nan,nan,nan,"other people, s work. and you put it into",No
5utoLhjUuAI17,1.56,1.58,your own word. It wa more to,No
5utoLhjUuAI18,1.58,2.06,paraphrasing than just changing one or,No
nan,nan,nan,two word here and there or cutting out,No
nan,nan,nan,word from a sentence. It will show your,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI19,2.06,2.18,"understanding to the reader, so, instead",No
nan,nan,nan,of just identifying that something s,No
nan,nan,nan,important and copying it word,No
nan,nan,nan,You ve been able to read it understand,No
nan,nan,nan,it and apply it to your work. So I m,No
5utoLhjUuAI20,2.18,2.35,"going to show you an example, of how to",No
nan,nan,nan,go from using a quote to paraphrasing it,No
nan,nan,nan,So if We look at this quote here in,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"academic writing, it s essential to state",No
nan,nan,nan,the source of idea information. Such,No
5utoLhjUuAI21,2.35,2.39,reference allow reader to refer back,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to the source themselves. This next,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI22,2.39,2.46,slide show you my First attempt of,No
nan,nan,nan,paraphrasing the original is at the,No
nan,nan,nan,bottom. My first attempt at the top,No
5utoLhjUuAI23,2.49,3,"Cottrell state that in writing, it s",Structure
nan,nan,nan,important to state the source of idea,Structure
nan,nan,nan,reference allow reader to find the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,source themselves. Okay. What do you,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI24,3,3.11,think about my First attempt of,No
nan,nan,nan,paraphrasing,No
nan,nan,nan,you have nt quoted it properly it s not,No
nan,nan,nan,a very good attempt. You re right. I,No
5utoLhjUuAI25,3.11,3.11,nan,No
5utoLhjUuAI26,3.11,3.15,have nt done it properly I ve cut out,No
nan,nan,nan,some word here and there I ve used some,No
nan,nan,nan,synonym. I ve changed essential to,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI27,3.17,3.3,important it s not actually enough to do,No
nan,nan,nan,this and call it paraphrasing at the top,No
nan,nan,nan,you ll see my next attempt the original,No
nan,nan,nan,at the bottom. and my First attempt is in,No
5utoLhjUuAI28,3.3,3.3,view. here contrl state that referencing,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI29,3.32,3.41,should always be used when using the,No
nan,nan,nan,idea and opinion of others and,No
nan,nan,nan,"academic writing, so that the original",No
nan,nan,nan,source can be easily located. What do you,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI30,3.41,3.57,think of this attempt yeah that s much,No
nan,nan,nan,better and you properly reference the,No
nan,nan,nan,"page, a well okay? So this is a much",No
nan,nan,nan,better attempt at paraphrasing I m not,No
nan,nan,nan,"going to claim it perfect, but you can",Structure
nan,nan,nan,see that I certainly have tried to put,No
nan,nan,nan,it into my own word. and I ve still got,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI31,3.57,4.02,the same point across and I ve correctly,No
nan,nan,nan,referenced the author.,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI32,4.08,4.11,So once you paraphrase once you ve put,Structure
nan,nan,nan,something into your own word. how do you,No
5utoLhjUuAI33,4.11,4.16,include that in your text well you need,No
nan,nan,nan,to make sure you put the surname of the,No
nan,nan,nan,author. or the organization and you need,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI34,4.17,4.21,to put the year of publication. So that,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI35,4.21,4.26,will look like this at the start of a,No
nan,nan,nan,sentence. Cottrell 2001 stated that,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI36,4.28,4.28,plagiarism. is a confusing and difficult,No
5utoLhjUuAI37,4.32,4.34,concept to fully understand. So you can,No
5utoLhjUuAI38,4.34,4.37,see at the beginning of the sentence. the,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI39,4.37,4.37,"author. s, surname go first and the date",Structure
5utoLhjUuAI40,4.39,4.41,of publication. come next. You would use,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI41,4.41,4.41,nan,No
5utoLhjUuAI42,4.41,4.44,a reference. at the beginning of the,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI43,4.44,4.44,sentence. if you re planning on talking,No
5utoLhjUuAI44,4.45,4.47,about this person s idea further. For,No
5utoLhjUuAI45,4.47,4.5,"example, my next sentence. say this",No
5utoLhjUuAI46,4.5,4.5,author. also found that you can see here,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI47,4.52,5,I ve referred back to Cottrell and it s,No
nan,nan,nan,obvious that I m continuing to talk,No
nan,nan,nan,about this person at the end of a,No
nan,nan,nan,sentence. It would look like this,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI48,5.03,5.08,plagiarism is a confusing and difficult,No
nan,nan,nan,concept to fully understand. Cottrell,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI49,5.08,5.1,2001 if you use a reference. at the end,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI50,5.1,5.14,of the sentence. It implies that you re,No
5utoLhjUuAI51,5.14,5.17,only talking about this last sentence.,No
5utoLhjUuAI52,5.19,5.28,paragraph and it s come from Cottrell it,Structure
nan,nan,nan,doe nt make that clear putting it at,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the end of the sentence. implies you re,No
5utoLhjUuAI53,5.28,5.3,only talking about this very last,No
nan,nan,nan,sentence. Okay. that s very important and,No
5utoLhjUuAI54,5.31,5.46,that s how accidental plagiarism can,No
nan,nan,nan,take place,Structure
nan,nan,nan,"so to conclude, referencing correctly can",No
nan,nan,nan,really strengthen your assignment. and,Structure
5utoLhjUuAI55,5.46,5.47,help you to do very well in your course.,No
5utoLhjUuAI56,5.5,5.52,When you paraphrase you should write,No
nan,nan,nan,"down what the author. ha said, completely",Structure
5utoLhjUuAI57,5.52,5.54,in your own word.,No
5utoLhjUuAI58,5.56,6.13,Remember it s not enough just to change,No
nan,nan,nan,one or two word here and there,No
nan,nan,nan,"Finally, you must give credit to the",Structure
nan,nan,nan,person whose idea you re using when you,No
nan,nan,nan,paraphrase and to do this you must,No
nan,nan,nan,"reference it correctly, if you re not",No
nan,nan,nan,"sure how to do that correctly, you can",No
nan,nan,nan,have a look at your faculty,No
nan,nan,nan,available on the LR web. This is what,No
5utoLhjUuAI59,6.13,6.2,your reference would look like in a,No

i5mYphUoOCs4,0.15,0.17,Hello there and welcome to this channel,No
nan,nan,nan,Communication Coach .,No
i5mYphUoOCs5,0.18,0.25,If you 've never tuned in yet,No
nan,nan,nan,this channel is here to help rising leader,No
nan,nan,nan,increase your personal impact,No
nan,nan,nan,so you can lead the people around you,No
nan,nan,nan,with more excellence .,No
i5mYphUoOCs6,0.27,0.29,And today we 're talking about communication skill,No
nan,nan,nan,specifically .,No
i5mYphUoOCs7,0.3,0.36,If you have n't had a lot of experience,No
nan,nan,nan,doing stand speaking,No
nan,nan,nan,I 'm going to give you some do and some don'ts,No
nan,nan,nan,that 'll help move you in the right direction .,No
i5mYphUoOCs8,0.38,0.45,And a we talk about these do and don'ts,No
nan,nan,nan,I want you to pick out which one you think,No
nan,nan,nan,would help you the most and feel free at any point,No
nan,nan,nan,to comment in that section below the video .,No
i5mYphUoOCs9,0.48,0.52,So when I said do 's and don'ts,No
nan,nan,nan,we 're actually going to start with the don'ts,No
nan,nan,nan,and then give you the do version of it,Structure
nan,nan,nan,so that 's the way we 'll organize it .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs10,0.54,0.54,So the first pair go like this .,No
i5mYphUoOCs11,0.56,0.56,Do n't ramble and get long .,No
i5mYphUoOCs12,1,1.09,Anytime a speaker is disorganized,No
nan,nan,nan,and weave all around,No
nan,nan,nan,it 's very hard to follow what he or she,No
nan,nan,nan,is talking about and instead what you want to do,No
nan,nan,nan,is give a nice organized and concise message .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs13,1.13,1.24,That mean you have to take the time beforehand,No
nan,nan,nan,when you 're preparing to create a nice introduction,Structure
nan,nan,nan,body and conclusion,Structure
nan,nan,nan,make sure you have clear main point,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and there 's a transition statement,Structure
nan,nan,nan,between each main point .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs14,1.25,1.35,Your audience is really going to appreciate,No
nan,nan,nan,an orderly presentation of your idea,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and it 's much more likely that they 'll remember,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what you said and really that 's the whole point,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of speaking to them in the first place .,No
i5mYphUoOCs15,1.37,1.4,The next do n't is do n't look with your eye,No
nan,nan,nan,in the wrong place .,No
i5mYphUoOCs16,1.42,1.48,You want to not look over people 's head,No
nan,nan,nan,or not look at the floor,No
nan,nan,nan,and not stare at the ceiling,No
nan,nan,nan,or scan around like that .,No
i5mYphUoOCs17,1.5,2,What you want to do is look directly,No
nan,nan,nan,into a person 's eye long enough to finish a thought,No
nan,nan,nan,and then move on and look directly,Structure
nan,nan,nan,into the next person 's eye,No
nan,nan,nan,long enough to finish a thought .,No
i5mYphUoOCs18,2.02,2.04,One public speaking teacher told me,No
nan,nan,nan,one thought one look .,No
i5mYphUoOCs19,2.06,2.08,In other word about a sentence or a half a sentence,No
nan,nan,nan,and then move on to the next person .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs20,2.11,2.12,Now this is very difficult to do,No
nan,nan,nan,if you 're not used to it .,No
i5mYphUoOCs21,2.13,2.18,It can feel very awkward looking right into someone 's eye,No
nan,nan,nan,but you have to gear up for this,No
nan,nan,nan,because that 's what audience want .,No
i5mYphUoOCs22,2.2,2.2,We want people to connect with this .,No
i5mYphUoOCs23,2.22,2.26,If you 're not looking into our eye,No
nan,nan,nan,and making u feel like we 're part of this,No
nan,nan,nan,then you 're not going to have much of an impact .,No
i5mYphUoOCs24,2.29,2.36,The next thing you want to do is do n't,No
nan,nan,nan,rather this is a do n't,No
nan,nan,nan,do n't clutter up all your note,Structure
nan,nan,nan,with too many detail .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs25,2.38,2.4,A lot of time we 're tempted to jam our note,No
nan,nan,nan,or our powerpoints with everything we want to say .,No
i5mYphUoOCs26,2.43,2.53,But the result is when we 're nervous in the moment,No
nan,nan,nan,we end up just locked in to our note,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and looking down the whole time and reading,No
nan,nan,nan,and sounding really stiff really wooden,No
nan,nan,nan,and you 're not going to again connect with people .,No
i5mYphUoOCs27,2.55,3.02,So what you want to do instead,No
nan,nan,nan,is pare down your note,No
nan,nan,nan,so that you can just have a conversational style,No
nan,nan,nan,with your audience .,No
i5mYphUoOCs28,3.03,3.11,And again a you 're practicing,No
nan,nan,nan,you have to whittle down those note,No
nan,nan,nan,so that all you have is like talking point,No
nan,nan,nan,like a little grocery list of item,No
nan,nan,nan,that you 're going to talk about .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs29,3.12,3.21,And it almost force you or at least free you,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to connect with people to look up,No
nan,nan,nan,and to have a nice normal conversation with them,No
nan,nan,nan,in your natural personality .,No
i5mYphUoOCs30,3.24,3.28,The next do n't is you do n't want to load up your slide,No
nan,nan,nan,with all complicated animation and text .,No
i5mYphUoOCs31,3.32,3.34,And one of the reason is you do n't want,No
nan,nan,nan,to stare at it and read from it .,No
i5mYphUoOCs32,3.35,3.4,The other reason is that it 's very hard to follow,No
nan,nan,nan,what 's going on if your slide,No
nan,nan,nan,are jam with the detail .,No
i5mYphUoOCs33,3.42,3.49,What you want to do instead is to make sure,No
nan,nan,nan,your slide are nice and clear,No
nan,nan,nan,and simple and help you make whatever point,No
nan,nan,nan,you 're making in that particular moment .,No
i5mYphUoOCs34,3.51,4.09,A rule of thumb that I like to use,No
nan,nan,nan,is if you 're spending more than about two or three minute,No
nan,nan,nan,on each PowerPoint slide,No
nan,nan,nan,then you 're probably wasting your time,No
nan,nan,nan,and I do n't recommend using more than a couple of slide,No
nan,nan,nan,for a presentation anyway if you 're a beginner,No
nan,nan,nan,because people tend to over rely on the slide,No
nan,nan,nan,and load up each single slide with way too much .,No
i5mYphUoOCs35,4.12,4.12,The next do n't is do n't fidget .,No
i5mYphUoOCs36,4.15,4.15,Do n't fidget with your hand .,No

nan,nan,nan,because you 're nervous .,No
i5mYphUoOCs39,4.22,4.34,What you want to do instead is have nice confident posture,No
nan,nan,nan,where you stand in one place for a little while,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then if you want to move with a purpose move,No
nan,nan,nan,stand in another place for a while,No
nan,nan,nan,and then share another part of your message .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs40,4.36,4.38,Move for the purpose stand still,No
nan,nan,nan,share some of your message .,No
i5mYphUoOCs41,4.39,4.4,Do n't just pace,No
nan,nan,nan,have nice confident posture .,No
i5mYphUoOCs42,4.42,4.42,Same thing with your hand .,No
i5mYphUoOCs43,4.43,4.45,You want to use gesture,No
nan,nan,nan,and emphasize your idea with your hand .,No
i5mYphUoOCs44,4.48,4.53,You do n't want to fidget and put them in your pocket,No
nan,nan,nan,or play with a pen or do anything else weird,No
nan,nan,nan,or distracting like that .,No
i5mYphUoOCs45,4.54,4.59,That 's a big part of how you come across non,No
nan,nan,nan,and I recommend to you when you 're practicing,No
nan,nan,nan,you work on this a well .,No
i5mYphUoOCs46,5.01,5.01,And the last do n't undo is how you use your voice .,No
i5mYphUoOCs47,5.04,5.07,What you do n't want to do is speak too softly,No
nan,nan,nan,use a lot of filler like um and ah and so .,No
i5mYphUoOCs48,5.11,5.16,What you want to do is have a confident voice,No
nan,nan,nan,where you speak loud like to the back of the room,No
nan,nan,nan,with a nice clear volume .,No
i5mYphUoOCs49,5.18,5.2,Aim for the back of the room because just think about it,No
nan,nan,nan,you have to reach those people .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs50,5.22,5.28,The other thing you want to do is emphasize,No
nan,nan,nan,your key word with the sound of your voice,No
nan,nan,nan,and also pause after you share a key idea,No
nan,nan,nan,or a key thought .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs51,5.3,5.3,Pause for a minute silently .,No
i5mYphUoOCs52,5.31,5.33,Do n't fill it up with an um or an oh,No
nan,nan,nan,the pause is much more effective .,No
i5mYphUoOCs53,5.35,5.37,So here are some do and don'ts,No
nan,nan,nan,some tip for beginner .,No
i5mYphUoOCs54,5.39,5.46,Again a I mentioned,No
nan,nan,nan,where do you see yourself in here ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Which one you think would help you the most,No
nan,nan,nan,in this list ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I would love to hear your comment,No
nan,nan,nan,in that section below .,Structure
i5mYphUoOCs55,5.48,5.49,So thanks God bless,No
nan,nan,nan,and I will see you in the next video .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM1,0,0.02,A lot of work go into creating,Structure
nan,nan,nan,well PowerPoint slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM2,0.05,0.1,Unfortunately many of the million of slide,No
nan,nan,nan,that are created every day,Structure
nan,nan,nan,are n't engaging the audience at all .,No
TQiln3CjtvM3,0.12,0.12,In fact many are hard to read and understand .,No
TQiln3CjtvM4,0.15,0.21,But there are a few really important,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and easy to implement tip that can really make a difference,No
nan,nan,nan,in your slide design .,No
TQiln3CjtvM5,0.23,0.23,Let 's check them out .,No
TQiln3CjtvM6,0.3,0.32,Before we get started a brief thanks to Skillshare,Structure
nan,nan,nan,for sponsoring today 's video .,No
TQiln3CjtvM7,0.34,0.36,Skillshare is a learning platform,No
nan,nan,nan,with lot of great class .,No
TQiln3CjtvM8,0.38,0.4,I have a special link for you that give you two month,No
nan,nan,nan,free premium access .,No
TQiln3CjtvM9,0.42,0.45,You 're going to find it in the description of this video,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and I 'll be chatting more about them towards the end .,No
TQiln3CjtvM10,0.48,0.48,Now let 's get started with my slide design tip .,No
TQiln3CjtvM11,0.52,0.52,Number one visualize your data .,No
TQiln3CjtvM12,0.55,0.55,Presenting number and data can be a challenge .,No
TQiln3CjtvM13,0.58,0.58,For one it 's probably not the most exciting topic .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM14,1.01,1.08,And second if you put a lot of data on your slide,No
nan,nan,nan,the audience is going to be busy reading the slide,No
nan,nan,nan,instead of paying attention to you .,No
TQiln3CjtvM15,1.1,1.17,Here 's an example a slide like this,No
nan,nan,nan,encourages the audience to read and try to make sense,No
nan,nan,nan,of the data .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM16,1.18,1.21,Their attention is going to be on the slide,No
nan,nan,nan,not on what you 're saying .,No
TQiln3CjtvM17,1.23,1.23,Instead you could present it like this .,No
TQiln3CjtvM18,1.27,1.29,Already from the title of the slide,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the audience can get the critical information .,No
TQiln3CjtvM19,1.31,1.34,The supporting chart make it easier,No
nan,nan,nan,to interpret the slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM20,1.36,1.42,The important thing here is that you guide the eye,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to the most important topic and avoid distraction,No
nan,nan,nan,on the slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM21,1.43,1.43,Which brings me to my next tip .,No
TQiln3CjtvM22,1.46,1.46,Number two use white space and do n't clutter .,No
TQiln3CjtvM23,1.5,1.54,White or negative space refers to the empty space,No
nan,nan,nan,in between your content on the slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM24,1.56,2,Sometimes we feel the urge to make use of,No
nan,nan,nan,every little space available to u on the slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM25,2.03,2.07,We plaster it with information and visual element,No
nan,nan,nan,but more is n't necessarily always better .,No
TQiln3CjtvM26,2.11,2.16,If you throw too much on the screen,No
nan,nan,nan,you get a cluttered page that 's unattractive,No
nan,nan,nan,and difficult to read .,No
TQiln3CjtvM27,2.17,2.2,People get frustrated when information bombard them,No
nan,nan,nan,you 're going to lose their attention .,No
TQiln3CjtvM28,2.22,2.22,So do n't do that .,No
TQiln3CjtvM29,2.24,2.31,White space is also important,No
nan,nan,nan,because it creates separation between the object,No
nan,nan,nan,on your slide and it focus the eye and the message,No
nan,nan,nan,you want to get across .,No
TQiln3CjtvM30,2.33,2.33,It also make text easier to read .,No
TQiln3CjtvM31,2.37,2.37,And also for the viewer it 's calming letting them breathe .,No
TQiln3CjtvM32,2.41,2.43,And do n't get me wrong,Structure
nan,nan,nan,white space doe n't have to be white .,No
TQiln3CjtvM33,2.45,2.48,White space can also be any solid color,No
nan,nan,nan,or even a blurred background .,No
TQiln3CjtvM34,2.51,2.54,It just mean that there is no other content,No
nan,nan,nan,or design element .,No
TQiln3CjtvM35,2.55,2.55,Apple is a master when it come to applying this concept .,No
TQiln3CjtvM36,2.59,3.02,It creates the feeling of luxury,No
nan,nan,nan,and put the product in focus .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM37,3.05,3.12,So when designing PowerPoint slide,No
nan,nan,nan,do n't create slide like this,No
nan,nan,nan,which result in visual overload,No
nan,nan,nan,the viewer eye will be all over the place .,No
TQiln3CjtvM38,3.15,3.15,Instead remember a few key rule .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM39,3.18,3.18,Keep the slide background clean .,No
TQiln3CjtvM40,3.2,3.24,Company logo and other corporate identity element,No
nan,nan,nan,do n't have to be on every single slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM41,3.26,3.26,White space principle also apply to your text on the slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM42,3.3,3.3,Use a font size that 's big enough with generous spacing .,No
TQiln3CjtvM43,3.34,3.37,If you ca n't fit all your text this way,No
nan,nan,nan,it 's probably too much text .,No
TQiln3CjtvM44,3.39,3.39,So it come down to le is more .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM45,3.43,3.43,Give the element on your slide some breathing room .,No
TQiln3CjtvM46,3.46,3.5,This way the eye land straight on the main message,No
nan,nan,nan,and the slide is going to have a greater impact .,No
TQiln3CjtvM47,3.53,3.53,Number three apply instant design idea .,No
TQiln3CjtvM48,3.57,4,Design idea is a new feature in Microsoft 365,No
nan,nan,nan,that 's powered by Microsoft 's AI or intelligence service .,No
TQiln3CjtvM49,4.05,4.11,You can find it on the Home tab,No
nan,nan,nan,which a we know is the prime real estate,No
nan,nan,nan,in any Office product .,No
TQiln3CjtvM50,4.13,4.17,So what doe it do ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Let 's say we have this rather uninspiring slide,No
nan,nan,nan,about some timeline .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM51,4.19,4.19,And we want to make it more visually appealing .,No
TQiln3CjtvM52,4.22,4.24,If you click on Design Ideas up here,No
nan,nan,nan,it will make several suggestion .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM53,4.27,4.27,Like this one .,No
TQiln3CjtvM54,4.28,4.28,Or this one is nice too .,No
TQiln3CjtvM55,4.3,4.32,And immediately by just clicking a button,No
nan,nan,nan,you have a much improved version of the slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM56,4.36,4.41,Or if you work with image in your slide,No
nan,nan,nan,design idea can convert these uncropped picture,No
nan,nan,nan,into a neatly organized slide automatically for you .,No
TQiln3CjtvM57,4.45,4.45,Like this one .,No
TQiln3CjtvM58,4.47,4.47,It also doe n't seem to like bullet point that much .,No
TQiln3CjtvM59,4.5,4.52,So if it see a slide like this,No
nan,nan,nan,it will suggest a more visual version of the slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM60,4.56,5.03,You can exchange the icon or color a you like,No
nan,nan,nan,but if the shape or color is a part of the slide background,No
nan,nan,nan,you ca n't adjust it .,No
TQiln3CjtvM61,5.05,5.1,If you have poor design skill like me,No
nan,nan,nan,or if you 're just in a hurry,No
nan,nan,nan,then design idea can definitely give you a good start .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM62,5.14,5.14,Number four use Scalable Vector Graphics .,No
TQiln3CjtvM63,5.18,5.18,The next tip is about the image in your presentation .,No
TQiln3CjtvM64,5.22,5.27,When you use raster image like JPGs or PNGs in your slide,No
nan,nan,nan,be careful when resizing them .,No
TQiln3CjtvM65,5.3,5.32,Take a look at this Excel logo here,No
nan,nan,nan,it look fine in the current size .,No
TQiln3CjtvM66,5.34,5.37,I can scale it down without problem,No
nan,nan,nan,but when I scale it up it 's going to become pixelated .,No
TQiln3CjtvM67,5.41,5.41,Scaling down is okay scaling up is not .,No
TQiln3CjtvM68,5.45,5.45,Not if you have these image .,No
TQiln3CjtvM69,5.47,5.52,But if you use SVGs,No
nan,nan,nan,which is short for Scalable Vector Graphics,No
nan,nan,nan,you can scale up without pixelation .,No
TQiln3CjtvM70,5.55,6.02,SVGs can be resized from small to large,No
nan,nan,nan,without losing quality because they consist of,No
nan,nan,nan,mathematical line and fill instead of pixel .,No
TQiln3CjtvM71,6.06,6.06,They are also much smaller in size .,No
TQiln3CjtvM72,6.09,6.16,For example the icon option in the insert tab are SVGs,No
nan,nan,nan,and recent version of PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,allows you to edit these graphic .,No
TQiln3CjtvM73,6.18,6.26,You can use the eyedropper tool to change the fill,No
nan,nan,nan,or you can even disassemble the SVG image by converting it,No
nan,nan,nan,to an Office shape .,No
TQiln3CjtvM74,6.27,6.3,This way you can change the fill of individual part,No
nan,nan,nan,of the image .,No
TQiln3CjtvM75,6.32,6.34,So whenever you can choose vector graphic,No
nan,nan,nan,over raster image .,No
TQiln3CjtvM76,6.36,6.4,You can scale them up without loss of resolution,No
nan,nan,nan,and they are smaller in size a well .,No
TQiln3CjtvM77,6.43,6.43,Number five apply the rule of third .,No
TQiln3CjtvM78,6.47,6.52,In photography and cinematography,No
nan,nan,nan,there is a basic guideline about how a shot,No
nan,nan,nan,should be composed .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM79,6.54,6.54,It 's called the rule of third .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM80,6.56,6.56,This also applies to PowerPoint slide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM81,6.58,6.58,Let me show you how .,No
TQiln3CjtvM82,7,7,Here we have a slide with an image and some text .,No
TQiln3CjtvM83,7.04,7.04,Let 's see how we can improve it .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM84,7.06,7.09,The rule of third basically divide the canvas,Structure
nan,nan,nan,into three horizontal row and three vertical column .,No
TQiln3CjtvM85,7.13,7.13,The line intersect at these four point .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM86,7.16,7.18,Guess what these are called ?,No
nan,nan,nan,PowerPoints .,No
TQiln3CjtvM87,7.2,7.27,What are the odds ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,The rule say that the key element of this slide,Structure
nan,nan,nan,should be pleased to run these PowerPoints,No
nan,nan,nan,or along the line .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM88,7.28,7.35,So let 's position the image like this with the head,No
nan,nan,nan,on this PowerPoint and the text box,No
nan,nan,nan,along the horizontal line like this .,No
TQiln3CjtvM89,7.38,7.38,Let 's compare them side by side .,Structure
TQiln3CjtvM90,7.4,7.44,What do you think ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Most people will prefer to second version,No
nan,nan,nan,it 's just more visually appealing .,No
TQiln3CjtvM91,7.46,7.49,An easy way to apply the rule of third in PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,is by using the guide .,No
TQiln3CjtvM92,7.51,7.51,Just go to the View tab and check the box next to guide .,No

nan,nan,nan,which ha puzzled me for quite a while,No
nan,nan,nan,and that is Why do our PowerPoints look the way they look ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Or rather How on earth can we accept that they look the way they look ?,No
nan,nan,nan,How can you do that ?,No
nan,nan,nan,And do you know,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what 's even more intellectually challenging for me to understand ?,No
nan,nan,nan,It 's How can a person sit over here in this meeting room with 10 others,No
nan,nan,nan,observing this dismally bad PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,filled with chart graphical element page number,No

nan,nan,nan,in the other conference room ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Is that a big chance ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Yeah .,No

Iwpi1Lm6dFo47,4.56,4.56,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo48,4.56,5.07,Now the bad news in the situation is this :,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you do not have a separate working memory for PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,and a separate working memory for train ticket .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo49,5.1,5.1,It 's the same dismally bad working memory for both activity .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo50,5.17,5.27,So I might be harsh when I say this,No
nan,nan,nan,but there is one man on this earth,No
nan,nan,nan,who know more about the brain than anybody else,No
nan,nan,nan,one of the most leading neurologist called John Medina,No
nan,nan,nan,and he put it like this .,No

nan,nan,nan,they will make a tremendous difference,No
nan,nan,nan,to every PowerPoint you 'll be delivering from this day and on .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo55,6.05,6.05,So let 's start .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo56,6.06,6.06,The first one of these five is one message .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo57,6.08,6.13,I received this from a customer,No
nan,nan,nan,and I said 'Hey we 've got a lot of issue in here,No
nan,nan,nan,but let 's start with the first one .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo58,6.15,6.15,You 've got two message .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo59,6.16,6.16,Let 's move one of them out of the way and just bring one message per slide . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo60,6.16,6.24,So why should we only have one message per slide ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well I 'll give you this beautiful example .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo61,6.26,6.31,You 're at this nice party you 've got the music going boom,No
nan,nan,nan,you 've got this person you 're chatting away to,No
nan,nan,nan,you 're having a good time .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo62,6.34,6.34,And then you hear your name ; you hear your name spoken somewhere .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo63,6.37,6.46,Your entire attention is now diverted in that direction,No
nan,nan,nan,and with this person you 're just nodding away,No
nan,nan,nan,hoping that you 're nodding in the right instance yeah ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Yes yes yes .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo64,6.47,6.49,After a minute this one stop talking about you,No
nan,nan,nan,so you divert your attention straight again .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo65,6.51,6.57,Now that person will then say 'Well do n't you agree ? ',Structure
nan,nan,nan,And do n't we just love that situation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,We have got no clue what they 've been talking about .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo66,7,7,The same thing go for PowerPoint .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo67,7.01,7.07,If you 've got more than one message,No
nan,nan,nan,the chance is big they will be focusing on this one and not that one,Structure
nan,nan,nan,or that one and not this one .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo68,7.09,7.09,Just make it simple for human being .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo69,7.11,7.11,Have one message per slide .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo70,7.12,7.12,We are extremely limited to understanding more .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo71,7.17,7.17,Let 's move on . Go to working memory .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo72,7.17,7.17,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo73,7.19,7.23,I 've already given you this bad vibe that your working memory is bad,No
nan,nan,nan,and I 'm afraid I 'm not coming with better news .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo74,7.27,7.27,I 'm coming with worse news and it go like this .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo75,7.3,7.39,This equation ha the basis of John Sweller and Mayer,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and they come to the conclusion,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that there is something in our brain called 'the redundancy effect ',No
nan,nan,nan,and it work like this .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo76,7.41,7.54,If you have text sentence on your PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,and you persist with the annoying idea of speaking at the same time,No
nan,nan,nan,what will be remembered by the audience,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is zero .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo77,7.57,7.57,Or very close to zero .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo78,7.59,8.03,Now why is that ? How doe that come about ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Well it ca n't look like this . It 's just not practical .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo79,8.03,8.03,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo80,8.07,8.07,You ca n't stand and have this and talk at the same time .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo81,8.09,8.11,So what are you supposed to do ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well use PowerPoint for what it 's supposed to be used for .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo82,8.15,8.21,Pick it like this pull down your text into the documentation field,No
nan,nan,nan,and use the area up there for the presentation material :,No
nan,nan,nan,short sweet bit of text and an image .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo83,8.24,8.24,That is what enhances your image .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo84,8.26,8.26,That is what enhances your message .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo85,8.28,8.28,So use PowerPoint a it 's supposed to be used .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo86,8.33,8.35,Come to the third of these five principle,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and that 's size .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo87,8.37,8.38,Before I go into that,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I want to make you aware the following .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo88,8.42,8.53,Every time you open your eye for the rest of your life,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you will focus on four thing :,Structure
nan,nan,nan,moving object signalling colour like red orange and yellow,No
nan,nan,nan,contrast object and big object for the rest of your life .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo89,8.58,8.58,Give you a practical example of that .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo90,9,9,Imagine yourself being home with a friend a really good friend .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo91,9.03,9.03,Now the television is on but the sound is off .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo92,9.07,9.12,You 're having a great conversation,No
nan,nan,nan,but do you find it easy to not look at the television ?,No
nan,nan,nan,No . Why not ?,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo93,9.12,9.18,Because it 's got moving object,No
nan,nan,nan,it 's got signalling colour it 's high in contrast,No
nan,nan,nan,and they 're usually very big these time .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo94,9.22,9.3,So why not use this to our benefit ?,No
nan,nan,nan,If you look at this where is your attention drawn to,No
nan,nan,nan,without you even having a chance of controlling it ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,It 's going to the big three all the time .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo95,9.33,9.33,Have a look at the practical situation ; have a look at this .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo96,9.36,9.37,Where are your eye drawn to ?,No
nan,nan,nan,I can see that they 're drawn constantly to the headline .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo97,9.41,9.45,Now how often is the headline the most important part in a PowerPoint ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,It 's very rare .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo98,9.48,9.56,Even so every PowerPoint template is built like this,No
nan,nan,nan,where the headline is the biggest object and the content is the smallest,No
nan,nan,nan,going absolute opposite to our biological reaction .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo99,10,10.03,So what doe this look like if we just show you an example ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well now I 've reduced the title and it look like this .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo100,10.06,10.13,Do you see how your eye now fall down into the content ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Now they 're sucked into the headline,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and now they 're falling down into the content .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo101,10.15,10.31,So I can control exactly where you are,No
nan,nan,nan,but why do people build PowerPoints,No
nan,nan,nan,where people will be spending 70 % of the time on the headline,No
nan,nan,nan,when it 's not the most important part ?,No
nan,nan,nan,So what I want you to take with you from this,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is the most important part of your PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,should also be the biggest nothing else .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo102,10.35,10.35,Moving on to number four contrast .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo103,10.41,10.41,Contrast control your focus .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo104,10.44,10.49,So what doe that look like ?,No
nan,nan,nan,For instance if I show you a list like this,No
nan,nan,nan,your eye are over the place,No
nan,nan,nan,because you do n't really know what to focus on .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo105,10.51,10.51,So I 'll use a built functionality into PowerPoint which go like this .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo106,10.55,10.59,I 'll show you the first subject I 'll take it away with contrast,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and I 'll show you the second one,No
nan,nan,nan,and I 'll do it again and again and again and again .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo107,11.03,11.03,You 're now following exactly the white spot .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo108,11.05,11.13,If I do this dun,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I can see your eye just wobbling around,No
nan,nan,nan,and you 're a bit like a kitten going after a little laser pointer on the wall,No
nan,nan,nan,going like 'Where is it ? I 've got it . I 've got it . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo109,11.13,11.13,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo110,11.13,11.16,Because you 're following where the white spot is and not the rest .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo111,11.2,11.2,Now this is a beautiful example .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo112,11.21,11.21,Please do use this .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo113,11.23,11.27,Use it because you can show amazing big table like this,No
nan,nan,nan,if you use the effect of contrast the principle of contrast .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo114,11.29,11.29,Look what this look like .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo115,11.31,11.36,Your eye are all over the place ; you do n't know what to focus on,No
nan,nan,nan,but I just apply the principle of contrast,No
nan,nan,nan,and it look like that and suddenly you know exactly what to focus on .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo116,11.4,11.41,Here they 're all over the place,No
nan,nan,nan,and here they 're exactly where I want them .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo117,11.45,11.53,Now there 's a big major drawback with PowerPoints,No
nan,nan,nan,and that is that the majority of company on this earth today,Structure
nan,nan,nan,they persist in having white background in PowerPoint .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo118,11.57,11.57,Look at that .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo119,11.58,11.58,Oh it 's bright it 's shiny .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo120,12,12.04,Could you tell me who ha the highest contrast me or the screen ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well the screen .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo121,12.06,12.08,Who 's usually the biggest me or the screen ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well the screen .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo122,12.09,12.23,So the only option I have is dress myself up in signalling colour,No
nan,nan,nan,and jump around on stage in order to balance that problem out,No
nan,nan,nan,and that is obviously not a good corporate strategy,No
nan,nan,nan,in the long term would it be ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I think the long strategy is to just switch it around .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo123,12.26,12.26,PowerPoint is not supposed to have white background .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo124,12.29,12.29,If I do this your eye relax .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo125,12.31,12.31,You focus on me .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo126,12.32,12.32,I 'm the biggest object .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo127,12.33,12.33,I 'm the most contrast object .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo128,12.37,12.37,I got your focus .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo129,12.38,12.45,Why is that important ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,It 's important because I am I always have been,No
nan,nan,nan,and I always will be the presentation .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo130,12.48,12.48,That is my visual aid .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo131,12.56,12.56,Moving into the last principle and that is object .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo132,13.03,13.06,Now this is one of the most severe principle,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and it go like this .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo133,13.07,13.1,How many object do I have here ?,No
nan,nan,nan,If you count them quickly you 'll see that I 've got 16 .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo134,13.12,13.2,Do you see this little beauty at the end a well,No
nan,nan,nan,which go 'page 12 of 95 ' ?,No
nan,nan,nan,What is that ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Why do we do that ?,No
nan,nan,nan,That only creates anxiety .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo135,13.22,13.22,If anything you are 'Oh my god I ca n't take 83 more of those . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo136,13.22,13.31,But it can also create hope,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because imagine ...,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo137,13.33,13.33,imagine when it 's 90 out of 95 .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo138,13.36,13.36,'Oh I can see the light ; I can see the end of the tunnel . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo139,13.36,13.42,Kidding aside do n't do that .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo140,13.45,13.54,Now there are so many idea out there,Structure
nan,nan,nan,on how many object you 're supposed to have in PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,and once and for all I just want to put my foot down,No
nan,nan,nan,and state to you that this is the perfect amount .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo141,13.57,13.57,In order to do that I want you to just feel it yourself .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo142,14,14.02,How many object are you supposed to have ?,No
nan,nan,nan,And we 're going to do that by showing you a couple of ball .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo143,14.06,14.06,I 'll throw up the ball .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo144,14.07,14.07,I want you to nod to me when you 've counted them .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo145,14.09,14.09,Simple instruction . You with me ?,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo146,14.09,14.12,Cool here we go .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo147,14.16,14.16,Alright take you about two second .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo148,14.19,14.19,Good . Well done .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo149,14.19,14.19,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo150,14.21,14.21,Your next set of ball .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo151,14.22,14.22,Count them and nod to me when you 've counted them .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo152,14.25,14.25,Here we go .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo153,14.27,14.27,Excellent . Yeah .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo154,14.27,14.27,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo155,14.28,14.3,That took you about 1.2 second if you 're normal,No
nan,nan,nan,which about 90 % of you seem to be .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo156,14.34,14.34,We 'll have the third set of ball the last one .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo157,14.37,14.37,Look at this nod to me when you 've counted them .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo158,14.4,14.43,Oh what wa that ?,No
nan,nan,nan,I just pressed the button and you nodded simultaneously .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo159,14.47,14.51,That will if you are normal take you 0.2 second,No
nan,nan,nan,two of a second .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo160,14.53,14.53,This will take you 1.2 this will take you two of a second .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo161,14.57,15,And for anyone of you who you 're good at math,No
nan,nan,nan,you 'll find out that that number is approximately 500 % difference .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo162,15.05,15.07,How is that even remotely possible ?,No
nan,nan,nan,There are only two object in difference .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo163,15.11,15.15,Well might I suggest the following :,No
nan,nan,nan,this one you have to count,No
nan,nan,nan,and this one you see .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo164,15.17,15.3,Could that be correct ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,So what you 've just experienced is the following :,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that the cognitive process of counting,No
nan,nan,nan,take 500 % longer time requires 500 % more energy resource,No
nan,nan,nan,to execute than just seeing .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo165,15.36,15.51,So what I want you to keep in mind at all time,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what I want you to keep in your head is this :,Structure
nan,nan,nan,which is the Swedish number for this :,No
nan,nan,nan,[ Six ],No
nan,nan,nan,The magical number is six .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo166,15.53,15.53,It 's not five it 's not seven it 's six .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo167,15.57,15.57,And I want to make you aware of this .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo168,15.59,16.13,When you go into a presentation in the future,No
nan,nan,nan,and you 've built this amazing PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,if you 've got more than seven object or seven or more object,No
nan,nan,nan,you have to be aware that all the people in there,No
nan,nan,nan,they have to use 500 % more energy and cognitive resource,No
nan,nan,nan,to understand what 's in your PowerPoint .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo169,16.16,16.28,Now how do you think,Structure
nan,nan,nan,their energy brain by nature behaves ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Will it go like 'Ooh I 'll easily invest 500 % more cognitive resource,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to understand this weird slide ',No
nan,nan,nan,or ' I wo n't ' ?,No
nan,nan,nan,' I wo n't . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo170,16.28,16.29,And you 've just incurred death by PowerPoint .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo171,16.33,16.36,Now what doe this look like in real life ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well have a look at this .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo172,16.37,16.4,Sixteen object can we agree that that 's too many ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Yes we can .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo173,16.42,16.44,So what doe it look like if we reduce it ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Look at this . We go from this to this .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo174,16.44,16.44,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo175,16.48,16.48,And this is where your brain go 'Ahh ' .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo176,16.52,16.52,And this is where your brain go 'Ugh ' .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo177,16.55,16.55,Ahh .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo178,17.01,17.14,And I assume that in the future,Structure
nan,nan,nan,when you deliver PowerPoints to your colleague to your fellow people,No
nan,nan,nan,you want them to go 'Ahh ',No
nan,nan,nan,when you show them your slide .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo179,17.16,17.16,You do n't want them to go 'Ugh ' .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo180,17.23,17.35,Now there is have you seen this movie,Structure
nan,nan,nan,'The Rain Man ' by Dustin Hoffman ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Seen that ?,No
nan,nan,nan,It 's a beauty is n't it ?,No
nan,nan,nan,He come into this cafeteria and somebody drop toothpick,No
nan,nan,nan,and he go like 'Boom 247 . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo181,17.35,17.4,It 's amazing is n't it ?,No
nan,nan,nan,His perceptive limit is here .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo182,17.43,17.47,Your perceptive limit,No
nan,nan,nan,is here .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo183,17.5,18.06,Now what amazes me,No
nan,nan,nan,is that whichever country I go to whichever company I see,No
nan,nan,nan,it seems like they build PowerPoints,No
nan,nan,nan,in the hope that all their fellow colleague are autistic or savant,No
nan,nan,nan,which obviously is not the case .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo184,18.11,18.11,So but then you go like this 'But David my god .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo185,18.16,18.16,This mean that I have to have more slide . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo186,18.16,18.23,'Yes that is entirely correct .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo187,18.26,18.26,You have understood me clearly . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo188,18.26,18.33,I want to make one thing clear here,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and that is that the amount of slide in your PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,ha never been the problem .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo189,18.38,18.38,It is the amount of object per slide which ha been the problem .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo190,18.45,18.53,The stupid idea,No
nan,nan,nan,that corporate organisation all over the world,Structure
nan,nan,nan,they 've come up with limitation going like,Structure
nan,nan,nan,'Ooh we 've got this clever idea :,No
nan,nan,nan,You ca n't use 40 slide . You can only use four . ',No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo191,18.53,18.53,nan,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo192,18.53,19.01,So what do people do ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Well they take the content of the rest 36,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and they jam it in the first four .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo193,19.03,19.07,My god is that counterproductive or what ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,And we call ourselves intelligent .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo194,19.11,19.11,No no .,No

Iwpi1Lm6dFo196,19.19,19.19,We ended up with 135 of these .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo197,19.23,19.26,And yes it gave an immediate result,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to the application that we were working for .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo198,19.3,19.3,So to summarise this .,Structure
Iwpi1Lm6dFo199,19.33,19.35,Let 's have some fun and do a cross,No
nan,nan,nan,because obviously I have to prove my point .,No
Iwpi1Lm6dFo200,19.37,19.41,Do you remember more than 90 % of what I said ?,No

nan,nan,nan,and trick that you can use for your,No

PgOD1j2DhNg23,2.32,2.32,Look at this video until the end .,No

nan,nan,nan,really interested to take your slide presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,game to the next level,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I even released a multi course and all the,No

nan,nan,nan,taking the course .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg26,2.52,2.55,If you 're interested in that,No
nan,nan,nan,I leave a link to the course in the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,description down below .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg27,2.56,3,So if you 'd like to learn more about that,No
nan,nan,nan,and also read lot of student review,No
nan,nan,nan,feel free to have a look and check out the course .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg28,3.02,3.02,But now let 's dive into that .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg29,3.04,3.06,I prepared a bunch of slide for you that just,No
nan,nan,nan,illustrate my point .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg30,3.08,3.1,Let 's now switch to my computer to have a look,No
nan,nan,nan,how this look like .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg31,3.11,3.11,Alright let 's jump into it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg32,3.13,3.13,So let 's start with some basic .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg33,3.15,3.17,Some basic element that should be included,No
nan,nan,nan,on every single page .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg34,3.18,3.18,So let 's start here on the bottom .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg35,3.2,3.2,What you see here is the date .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg36,3.21,3.21,The current date .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg37,3.22,3.27,And pretty frequently you put here the date,Structure
nan,nan,nan,either when the presentation happened,No
nan,nan,nan,where you present your page,No
nan,nan,nan,or when you created a document .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg38,3.29,3.41,Because what you will also find is that many document,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in professional context,No
nan,nan,nan,many presentation many slide,No
nan,nan,nan,are not actually created for actual presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,but rather a a document that is then circulated,Structure
nan,nan,nan,sent around in a company .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg39,3.42,3.47,And a date is just important,No
nan,nan,nan,because when in retrospect,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you 're able to actually know,No
nan,nan,nan,to understand when the document wa created .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg40,3.49,3.49,Which of course is important in many way .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg41,3.51,3.56,The second thing that you 'll include on,Structure
nan,nan,nan,pretty much every page,No
nan,nan,nan,is a page number .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg42,3.57,4.02,This of course is very useful if you sit,No
nan,nan,nan,in a meeting and just a colleague want,No
nan,nan,nan,to refer to a specific page .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg43,4.03,4.1,Then to be able to say okay,No
nan,nan,nan,this is a page 18 and then everybody know,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what page 18 exactly is,No
nan,nan,nan,because there is a page number included on the document .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg44,4.13,4.13,Then of course is very important .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg45,4.15,4.15,Next thing you should look at is the source .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg46,4.17,4.19,So here you can include a source,Structure
nan,nan,nan,such a Firm Learning .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg47,4.21,4.27,Of course you can even then include just your name,No
nan,nan,nan,or your department a a source,Structure
nan,nan,nan,but even better would be especially if you refer to a,No
nan,nan,nan,specific data then also give the source of the data .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg48,4.31,4.39,So what date are you using ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Where is the data coming from ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,When wa the date collected ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Some specific information on what data you 're using,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is what you can likely include here in the source .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg49,4.41,4.41,The next element that you can use are footnote .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg50,4.43,4.46,So footnote one two three this is just a part where,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you can give specific detail on certain thing .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg51,4.48,4.51,But maybe just not fit in the,No
nan,nan,nan,regular text on your page .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg52,4.53,4.58,Then you would just include it in the footnote,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to give you some extra space,No
nan,nan,nan,because it 's often a smaller font size,No
nan,nan,nan,than the main page .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg53,5,5,Just to show additional remark .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg54,5.01,5.04,And of course,No
nan,nan,nan,one of the most important element,No
nan,nan,nan,of every page is the action title .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg55,5.06,5.06,The action title is the title of the page .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg56,5.09,5.09,And creating a good action title is an art form itself .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg57,5.14,5.2,Now I will not go into much of detail,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in this video what a good action title look like,No
nan,nan,nan,because I already created a specific video,No
nan,nan,nan,only focusing on action title .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg58,5.22,5.25,The video even includes an exercise how you can,No
nan,nan,nan,improve your action title creation skill .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg59,5.28,5.29,If you 're interested in that,No
nan,nan,nan,have a look .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg60,5.31,5.34,I will include a link to the video above,No
nan,nan,nan,so that you can directly look into it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg61,5.35,5.35,So far so good .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg62,5.36,5.39,So this wa some just really bare basic,No
nan,nan,nan,that should be included in every page .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg63,5.4,5.4,Let 's jump into something else .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg64,5.41,5.41,And this is the creation of chart .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg65,5.44,5.49,So what you will see in consulting,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is that almost every slide that you use,No
nan,nan,nan,contains a chart .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg66,5.5,5.5,So some kind of diagram where you depict data .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg67,5.53,5.55,The reason is that in consulting,No
nan,nan,nan,very frequently your argumentation will be based on data .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg68,5.59,6.02,You can just expect from you,No
nan,nan,nan,that you will back up your finding,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and your recommendation with some date analysis .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg69,6.05,6.1,And if you do these kind of data analysis,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of course you will frequently use chart to then,No
nan,nan,nan,show the result of your analysis .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg70,6.12,6.14,And these are just the chart that you can create,No
nan,nan,nan,with the think expansion .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg71,6.16,6.19,If you do not know think,Structure
nan,nan,nan,it 's a plugin that very frequently is used,No
nan,nan,nan,by consulting firm to create the chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg72,6.22,6.22,So almost every consulting firm us it .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg73,6.24,6.28,Of course if you do not have it,No
nan,nan,nan,you can just also work with the regular,No
nan,nan,nan,PowerPoint built chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg74,6.29,6.32,If you have the opportunity to use think,No
nan,nan,nan,I can highly recommend it,No
nan,nan,nan,because it really improves your workflow .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg75,6.34,6.37,If you now go over this chart tile,No
nan,nan,nan,many of them you will already know,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and probably frequently use yourself .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg76,6.39,6.42,Such a stacked bar chart or the 100 % bar chart,No
nan,nan,nan,clustered bar chart and so on .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg77,6.44,6.46,Right now I 'd just like to put your attention to,No
nan,nan,nan,the waterfall chart type .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg78,6.48,6.52,So the waterfall chart type is a chart type,No
nan,nan,nan,that in consulting,No
nan,nan,nan,especially at McKinsey you will use all of the time .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg79,6.54,6.56,So there 's almost no presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,without a waterfall present .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg80,6.58,6.58,But outside of consulting I really rarely see it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg81,7.01,7.01,Just from my observation .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg82,7.03,7.08,The fact alone that a presentation includes a,Structure
nan,nan,nan,waterfall chart very often is a clear telltale sign,No
nan,nan,nan,that a MBB consulting firm worked on it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg83,7.11,7.18,And actually most of the case it ha been McKinsey,No
nan,nan,nan,because for whatever reason,No
nan,nan,nan,waterfall chart are just so commonly used,No
nan,nan,nan,by McKinsey consultant .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg84,7.19,7.19,So let 's look at an example .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg85,7.2,7.22,So this is just a basic example,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of what a waterfall chart look like .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg86,7.24,7.3,And I 'd just like to use this example to show to you,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what I believe the waterfall chart can just be so,No
nan,nan,nan,helpful in so many business presentation .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg87,7.33,7.37,So this of course is just a stylist chart,No
nan,nan,nan,an illustrative chart so let 's not,No
nan,nan,nan,care about the specific number .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg88,7.38,7.38,But this is now a bridge chart .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg89,7.41,7.43,Actually many people instead of using waterfall,No
nan,nan,nan,they also just call them bridge .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg90,7.45,7.45,So bridge chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg91,7.46,7.47,Because waterfall chart are very helpful,No
nan,nan,nan,to show a bridge .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg92,7.49,7.49,To show how one number relates to another number .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg93,7.52,7.54,One way that this is frequently used,No
nan,nan,nan,is to show bridge between financial figure .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg94,7.56,7.56,So here we compare the EBITDA .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg95,7.58,8.01,So the earnings before interest text depreciation,No
nan,nan,nan,amortization of 2019 . To the EBITDA in 2020,No
PgOD1j2DhNg96,8.01,8.04,and we like to understand the difference .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg97,8.07,8.08,And if you just look at the number,No
nan,nan,nan,here it ha been 1.59 and here it ha been 1.67 .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg98,8.12,8.15,So at first glance it could look like the number,No
nan,nan,nan,are pretty similar .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg99,8.16,8.2,So you could infer,No
nan,nan,nan,that actually the company ha been quite stable,Structure
nan,nan,nan,there were many thing that actually changed .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg100,8.22,8.29,If you do n't break down the difference of these,No
nan,nan,nan,two number into all the effect,No
nan,nan,nan,that actually changed,No
nan,nan,nan,from 2019,No
nan,nan,nan,to 2020 .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg101,8.31,8.32,You 'd see that there are quite,Structure
nan,nan,nan,some thing going on .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg102,8.34,8.41,So here wa one effect that if you use,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the EBITDA by 700,No
nan,nan,nan,but then this is compensated by another effect,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that increased it by 730 .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg103,8.42,8.44,And there 's another positive effect,Structure
nan,nan,nan,further increasing it by 450 .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg104,8.46,8.48,And a reduction by 650,No
nan,nan,nan,and then another increase in 250 .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg105,8.5,8.57,So what you can see is that the waterfall chart,No
nan,nan,nan,really enables you to breakdown,No
nan,nan,nan,something into the different sub component,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that were driving it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg106,8.58,9,And then enable it to make change visible,No
nan,nan,nan,that were just not visible .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg107,9.03,9.05,Just looking at the total difference,No
nan,nan,nan,between two number .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg108,9.06,9.06,Let 's now look into another,Structure
nan,nan,nan,very ambiguous chart element .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg109,9.09,9.09,This is a so callout .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg110,9.12,9.12,This is this element right here .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg111,9.14,9.16,So this is an element that you can just,Structure
nan,nan,nan,include in a chart .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg112,9.18,9.18,Gives detail about this specific element .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg113,9.21,9.25,So a I wrote here it can include remark,Structure
nan,nan,nan,on specific element of a chart or other relevant,No
nan,nan,nan,contribution that you wan na make .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg114,9.27,9.31,A callout is something that you can easily use,No
nan,nan,nan,just add detail,Structure
nan,nan,nan,add information,Structure
nan,nan,nan,add context to one specific element .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg115,9.33,9.33,This is a frequent way how you can do it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg116,9.36,9.38,So this element just consists of one line,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then another line with a special ending .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg117,9.4,9.4,So if you ha never created this yourself .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg118,9.42,9.49,I just broke down here the element here,No
nan,nan,nan,you see the line and that this is just,Structure
nan,nan,nan,another line then it 's you can know in the line setting,No
nan,nan,nan,you can just add also such an endpoint to it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg119,9.51,9.51,Then if you combine it this is what it look like .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg120,9.54,9.55,So this is just an easy way to create,No
nan,nan,nan,this kind of callout element .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg121,9.57,10.01,And believe it or not but callouts like this,No
nan,nan,nan,will be used in pretty much every single,No
nan,nan,nan,consulting presentation that you see .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg122,10.03,10.05,Another element that might have catched your,Structure
nan,nan,nan,attention is something that is called a sticker .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg123,10.07,10.07,And this is what you see here in the top right .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg124,10.09,10.12,So a sticker is a qualification of the,No
nan,nan,nan,page that you use .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg125,10.13,10.13,Here you see the preliminary sticker .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg126,10.15,10.18,So let 's now just go over some example of sticker,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that are frequently and commonly used .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg127,10.2,10.22,Then what the context is how you use them,No
nan,nan,nan,in the consulting context .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg128,10.24,10.28,So for discussion sticker,No
nan,nan,nan,the preliminary sticker,No
nan,nan,nan,highly preliminary indicative,No
nan,nan,nan,and then illustrative .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg129,10.31,10.33,So these are probably the five,No
nan,nan,nan,most commonly used sticker .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg130,10.35,10.35,Of course you could write other thing a well .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg131,10.37,10.39,And sticker are element that are,No
nan,nan,nan,pretty much used to protect yourself .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg132,10.41,10.5,So why could this be important ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,Why would you need to protect yourself ?,No
nan,nan,nan,So let 's imagine you make an analysis,Structure
nan,nan,nan,which might be a bit controversial,No
nan,nan,nan,you know that their resides,Structure
nan,nan,nan,will not please everybody .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg133,10.52,11.01,And what you can do is,No
nan,nan,nan,to include such a for discussion sticker,No
nan,nan,nan,then if you walk into a meeting,Structure
nan,nan,nan,then you realize that your analysis spark,Structure
nan,nan,nan,some discussion and then yet you can say,Structure
nan,nan,nan,well  Yes of course this is not the final result . '',Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg134,11.01,11.04, This is just for discussion . '',No
PgOD1j2DhNg135,11.04,11.06,As you also wrote here .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg136,11.07,11.07, So let 's just have a discussion about it . '',No
PgOD1j2DhNg137,11.07,11.08, I 'm interested to hear your opinion . '',No
PgOD1j2DhNg138,11.08,11.15, What is your view of it ? '',No
nan,nan,nan, Why do you believe this is true ? '',No
nan,nan,nan, What is your opinion ? '',No
nan,nan,nan,So this is how you frequently use,No
nan,nan,nan,such a for discussion sticker .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg139,11.17,11.25,Preliminary and highly preliminary,Structure
nan,nan,nan,this is just something to make clear,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that the result that you 're showing,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the analysis that you are doing,No
nan,nan,nan,are not the final one .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg140,11.27,11.32,And here again this just is a way to protect yourself,No
nan,nan,nan,that then if later it come out that,Structure
nan,nan,nan,maybe your were missing some data .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg141,11.34,11.35,That there additional information that you,Structure
nan,nan,nan,would need to take into consideration .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg142,11.37,11.4,You can just say  Yes of course this analysis that '',No
nan,nan,nan, we did here wa only preliminary . '',Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg143,11.4,11.43, This wa not the final version . '',No
PgOD1j2DhNg144,11.43,11.58,This is also again to protect yourself,No
nan,nan,nan,because otherwise it could happen,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and these thing happen right ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,That there is a hostile client,No
nan,nan,nan,that then just point out a page that you created,Structure
nan,nan,nan,maybe in the first week of your engagement,No
nan,nan,nan,that you were just learning,No
nan,nan,nan,trying to understand the data .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg145,12,12.05,And the page you labeled you just did wa complete BS,No
nan,nan,nan,because this analysis that you created,Structure
nan,nan,nan,wa just obviously not correct .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg146,12.07,12.1,Right ?,No
nan,nan,nan,And maybe he wa right maybe it just wa n't correct,No
nan,nan,nan,because you did n't have the full picture .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg147,12.12,12.18,But then you can say  Yes Mister this is true you are '',No
nan,nan,nan, right but a you can also read here this wa not a final '',Structure
nan,nan,nan, version of the analysis . '',Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg148,12.18,12.19, This wa just a preliminary version . '',Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg149,12.19,12.21,And incident like that happen .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg150,12.23,12.23,And this is why you put the preliminary sticker on it .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg151,12.25,12.27,That 's similar but different is the indicative sticker,No
nan,nan,nan,and also the illustrative sticker .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg152,12.29,12.35,So an indicative sticker you can use just to make,No
nan,nan,nan,it clear that a certain analysis that you make,Structure
nan,nan,nan,maybe ha some flaw,No
nan,nan,nan,maybe ha some drawback .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg153,12.37,12.38,So the number that you show,No
nan,nan,nan,should not be taken that serious .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg154,12.41,12.53,But it give a good direction,No
nan,nan,nan,so that you believe that the analysis,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the result that you show are at least are,Structure
nan,nan,nan,indicatively right,No
nan,nan,nan,and these show the right direction,No
nan,nan,nan,the right picture,No
nan,nan,nan,even thought the specific number that you use,No
nan,nan,nan,might not be accurate .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg155,12.54,12.54,And this of course can happen in any situation .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg156,12.56,13,You need to work with the incomplete data set,Structure
nan,nan,nan,where you 're lacking certain information,No
nan,nan,nan,that you just were not able to use .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg157,13.02,13.04,Then you might want to make it clear that the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,analysis that you 're showing is just indicative .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg158,13.06,13.06,Illustrative go kind of even further than indicative .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg159,13.1,13.2,And it 's sometimes also used a bit in a dirty way,No
nan,nan,nan,in the sense that you can show a whole chart of very,Structure
nan,nan,nan,specific information very specific graph,No
nan,nan,nan,then you can put an illustrative sticker on it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg160,13.22,13.23,You can make it clear that actually,No
nan,nan,nan,the number are not true .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg161,13.25,13.29,That you just made up the whole chart right ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Maybe the whole chart doe n't contain,No
nan,nan,nan,any real number at all .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg162,13.32,13.36,But you just wanted to show a certain relationship,No
nan,nan,nan,how you believe that it is from your experience,Structure
nan,nan,nan,or maybe from other information that you have .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg163,13.38,13.48,So you 're just drawing this chart,No
nan,nan,nan,which maybe not even contains any real number at all,No
nan,nan,nan,but illustratively this is the chart you believe,No
nan,nan,nan,it look like .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg164,13.48,13.48,So this is how you put the illustrative sticker on it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg165,13.51,13.56,So if you see the illustrative sticker on a presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,pretty frequently you can assume that actually,No
nan,nan,nan,the number are not real .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg166,13.57,13.57,The number are not actual number .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg167,13.59,14.01,But this chart pretty much just wa made up,Structure
nan,nan,nan,by the consultant who used it .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg168,14.03,14.06,So now another element that you can frequently use,No
nan,nan,nan,is something that is called a takeaway box .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg169,14.09,14.11,So takeaway box are something,No
nan,nan,nan,like this that you include below your chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg170,14.14,14.14,It includes an important overall remark .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg171,14.16,14.21,So while the callout you saw earlier,No
nan,nan,nan,usually is used for just given information on,No
nan,nan,nan,a specific element of the chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg172,14.23,14.28,If you ever have genuine information,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that is relevant to the whole chart,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you can just include such a takeaway box,No
nan,nan,nan,below the chart that you are showing .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg173,14.3,14.38,In the takeaway box you can just include the main insight,No
nan,nan,nan,the main piece of information,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that you want the reader the viewer the listener,No
nan,nan,nan,to takeaway from the chart that you are showing .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg174,14.41,14.44,Another element that you can use that look similar,No
nan,nan,nan,but is often used in a slightly different way .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg175,14.45,14.45,It is something that you would call a bubble .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg176,14.48,14.56,So bubble is sometimes also called a sticker,No
nan,nan,nan,and it 's included in a chart in some way like that,Structure
nan,nan,nan,so you purposely make it look like this,No
nan,nan,nan,just included in front of something else .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg177,14.59,15.01,It look a bit le informal than for instance,No
nan,nan,nan,a takeaway box .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg178,15.02,15.07,And a bubble you often use to include,No
nan,nan,nan,some kind of limitation,No
nan,nan,nan,to the analysis that you are showing a,Structure
nan,nan,nan,limitation to the data that you are showing .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg179,15.09,15.15,And a bubble is called a bubble,No
nan,nan,nan,because sometimes instead of a rectangular form,No
nan,nan,nan,you can also use a circular form of the text that,No
nan,nan,nan,you are showing .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg180,15.16,15.19,So that the text is included in a circle,No
nan,nan,nan,instead of a rectangular form .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg181,15.2,15.24,From the standpoint bubble are so important,No
nan,nan,nan,you need to put yourself into the shoe,No
nan,nan,nan,of a consultant .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg182,15.25,15.29,Because very frequently you receive certain data set,No
nan,nan,nan,certain information from your client .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg183,15.31,15.35,And then you take several day,No
nan,nan,nan,or maybe even week to then conduct the analysis,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then to come up with some kind of a result .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg184,15.37,15.56,Then very often what happens is that then,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the last day some anxious hour before,No
nan,nan,nan,the big presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,where you then want to show the result,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you receive some new information,Structure
nan,nan,nan,maybe you realize that now some new data came out,Structure
nan,nan,nan,maybe now the next month 's finished,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and now you put re all the analysis,Structure
nan,nan,nan,with all the data from the new time period,Structure
nan,nan,nan,from the new month .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg185,15.57,16.14,In these situation you 're very frequently faced with,No
nan,nan,nan,the decision to whether you want to re now,No
nan,nan,nan,all the analysis,No
nan,nan,nan,to incorporate this new information or whether,No
nan,nan,nan,will you leave all the analysis as ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,And then just include a bubble on the page,No
nan,nan,nan,stating the limitation or stating what ha not,No
nan,nan,nan,yet been included in the analysis .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg186,16.17,16.22,Bubbles are so important because very frequently,No
nan,nan,nan,instead of re the whole thing re analysis,No
nan,nan,nan,re all kind of page .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg187,16.24,16.24,Problems like that you can frequently use with the bubble .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg188,16.27,16.36,And this is why there is a magic saying in consulting,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and this go like  If in trouble use a bubble ! '',No
nan,nan,nan,So if you are struggling with something,No
nan,nan,nan,something just is n't right .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg189,16.38,16.43,You just need to use this statement,No
nan,nan,nan,just need to make some correction,No
nan,nan,nan,in the end if you 're in trouble,Structure
nan,nan,nan,most of the problem you can just use with a bubble .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg190,16.46,16.46,Just stating the specific thing that you want to change .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg191,16.49,16.51,Now some other frequently used element,No
nan,nan,nan,are circle with number .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg192,16.54,17.03,This again is something that I very frequently,Structure
nan,nan,nan,see in consulting presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,but I rarely see line of circle with number like that in,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation that are being done by non people .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg193,17.05,17.05,So how do you use these thing .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg194,17.08,17.11,So you can use these kind of number circle whenever,No
nan,nan,nan,you want to include another layer of data .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg195,17.14,17.16,Another dimension of number,Structure
nan,nan,nan,which is not directly part of the chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg196,17.19,17.19,So let 's look at this stylized chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg197,17.21,17.22,So what do we see here ?,No
nan,nan,nan,So these are the revenue figure of a business .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg198,17.24,17.26,But not the absolute figure,No
nan,nan,nan,but the difference to the previous year .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg199,17.29,17.33,So we look into these calendar week,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and we look into how the business performed,Structure
nan,nan,nan,against the previous year .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg200,17.34,17.41,So here so this would mean that in the calendar,Structure
nan,nan,nan,week seven of the year,No
nan,nan,nan,the business had revenue that were by a 100 million higher,No
nan,nan,nan,than in the previous year .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg201,17.43,17.46,You have 200 million higher 250 million higher,No
nan,nan,nan,here a 100 million le and so on .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg202,17.49,17.55,Of course in this context if you look at this,No
nan,nan,nan,it would be interesting and important to u,No
nan,nan,nan,to include what the absolute amount,No
nan,nan,nan,what the revenue wa in the current year 2020 .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg203,17.58,18.04,In situation like that where you just want to include a,No
nan,nan,nan,a second point of data second point of information,Structure
nan,nan,nan,circle of number like that are just very commonly used .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg204,18.08,18.18,So here you would now include information,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that in the calendar week seven,No
nan,nan,nan,you make now the revenue of 900 million,No
nan,nan,nan,and this wa 100 million more,No
nan,nan,nan,than you made in the previous year .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg205,18.2,18.27,Then regarding the legend what you do is,No
nan,nan,nan,the main legend that you state in the chart title,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the main legend always refers to the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,number in the main chart .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg206,18.29,18.32,And for the circle you can include a sub,No
nan,nan,nan,then explain what is shown and depicted in these circle .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg207,18.36,18.39,And if you 're interested to learn more about how to set up,No
nan,nan,nan,consulting style chart like that .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg208,18.41,18.46,I created a whole other video just discussing,Structure
nan,nan,nan,how you should set up the chart title,Structure
nan,nan,nan,then also the subtitle and thing like that .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg209,18.48,18.56,So if you have n't seen that yet,No
nan,nan,nan,I believe this is also highly relevant,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and something that you need to know,Structure
nan,nan,nan,if you work in consulting,No
nan,nan,nan,or want to create presentation that meet the,No
nan,nan,nan,standard of consulting firm .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg210,18.58,19,I will leave it above here for you,No
nan,nan,nan,check it out if you 'd like to see it a well .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg211,19.02,19.05,Next concept I would like to talk about is also a,Structure
nan,nan,nan,very very important one .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg212,19.07,19.07,And it 's the concept of clothesline .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg213,19.09,19.09,More specifically of avoiding clothesline .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg214,19.13,19.25,So what do we call clothesline in consulting ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Clotheslines are referred to a just long list of thing,No
nan,nan,nan,and specifically in the context,No
nan,nan,nan,of creating PowerPoint presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,just long list of bullet .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg215,19.27,19.36,So what you will always never see in,Structure
nan,nan,nan,consulting style presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,is just the list of bullet like that,Structure
nan,nan,nan,where you just randomly list all kind of thought,Structure
nan,nan,nan,or other explanation that you want to .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg216,19.38,19.45,So why is this bad ?,No
nan,nan,nan,So if you just use a list of thought like this,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what you 're missing what you 're not showing,No
nan,nan,nan,what you 're not doing is giving it some kind of structure .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg217,19.49,19.5,If you present thing like that,No
nan,nan,nan,it look completely random .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg218,19.53,20,The person looking at it,No
nan,nan,nan,can have no trust at all that actually the thing,No
nan,nan,nan,that are mentioned here are complete,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that all the relevant aspect,Structure
nan,nan,nan,have been discussed and addressed by you .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg219,20.02,20.04,But it just seems like a completely random,Structure
nan,nan,nan,unstructured list of point .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg220,20.07,20.09,In such an unstructured list of point,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is what you would call a clothesline .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg221,20.11,20.11,And you want to avoid clothesline .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg222,20.13,20.19,So what is now used in consulting to avoid,No
nan,nan,nan,clothesline like that ?,No
nan,nan,nan,And very frequently,No
nan,nan,nan,what you do is to use structure element .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg223,20.21,20.27,So here again just in the illustrative page,Structure
nan,nan,nan,this could be out of for instance an M & A transaction,Structure
nan,nan,nan,a merger 's and acquisition transaction .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg224,20.28,20.28,Where one company aim to buy another company .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg225,20.31,20.4,Another company is showing how the purchasing price,No
nan,nan,nan,that they want to offer for a company split down,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to the different asset that the company ha,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and that the company is selling .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg226,20.42,20.45,Here again this is now,Structure
nan,nan,nan,another frequent use of a waterfall chart,No
nan,nan,nan,that you now have the total purchasing price .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg227,20.47,20.51,Now you show how this break down into the different,No
nan,nan,nan,subelements of the company .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg228,20.53,20.55,Now here you have the different asset that the company,Structure
nan,nan,nan,ha to offer u so here property plant and equipment .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg229,20.58,21.02,Then of course there could be a whole lot of other,Structure
nan,nan,nan,asset that the company offer,Structure
nan,nan,nan,for instance inventory and so on .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg230,21.04,21.07,Now a clothesline would be just to state all these asset,No
nan,nan,nan,just in a random list of bullet .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg231,21.09,21.11,Now to avoid clothesline,No
nan,nan,nan,what you often use is structure element .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg232,21.14,21.23,So what you try is to define bucket,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to define group of element,Structure
nan,nan,nan,then you can use to organize the different subelements,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that are from bullet point that you have .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg233,21.25,21.33,Now here just a simple example is to use gray bar,No
nan,nan,nan,that you include in front of the element,No
nan,nan,nan,then the company you will often distinguish the,Structure
nan,nan,nan,fixed asset from the current asset .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg234,21.36,21.39,This is now a structure that I defined,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in that in this structure,Structure
nan,nan,nan,now I can use a different bullet point .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg235,21.42,21.44,And I hope you now understand that this is superior,Structure
nan,nan,nan,to other way of structuring the point .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg236,21.45,21.56,Because now by having to use the structure,Structure
nan,nan,nan,fixed asset and current asset,No
nan,nan,nan,I already have some kind of guarantee,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that if I now look at these two type of asset,No
nan,nan,nan,I will catch all the asset,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that are included in the company .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg237,21.59,22.01,Because this way now I have covered,No
nan,nan,nan,the whole balance sheet of the company .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg238,22.02,22.06,And I can be sure that I will have covered all,Structure
nan,nan,nan,the asset within these two group .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg239,22.08,22.13,So always use structure element,Structure
nan,nan,nan,avoid at all cost using clothesline,No
nan,nan,nan,because this is just completely unprofessional .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg240,22.14,22.17,This is probably one of the first point of feedback,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that you will get a a young consultant .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg241,22.19,22.21,If you created a page just using,No
nan,nan,nan,a list of bullet point like this .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg242,22.22,22.27,So this concludes my little list of tip and trick,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of element that you can use to,No
nan,nan,nan,improve your PowerPoint page a well .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg243,22.29,22.29,I hope you found this wa useful .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg244,22.31,22.35,If you have any question about that,No
nan,nan,nan,feel free to leave me a comment below,No
nan,nan,nan,in the comment section .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg245,22.36,22.47,I will answer every single comment,No
nan,nan,nan,and I also like to hear from you,No
nan,nan,nan,what are your little tip ?,No
nan,nan,nan,What are the thing that you 've frequently use,No
nan,nan,nan,to improve your presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Let 's have a conversation here from which,No
nan,nan,nan,everybody can benefit .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg246,22.48,22.51,Again if you took any value out of this video at all,Structure
nan,nan,nan,please hit the like button for the YouTube algorithm .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg247,22.54,22.59,This would really help me and my channel to improve,No
nan,nan,nan,to grow and to tell the YouTube algorithm that this,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is a video worthwhile for other distributing .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg248,23.02,23.04,If you are a first time viewer to this channel,No
nan,nan,nan,thank you for your time and thank you for watching .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg249,23.05,23.05,Please hit the subscribe button you will stay up .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg250,23.08,23.08,If you want to see more content like this .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg251,23.1,23.12,And if you would like to make sure that you really see,No
nan,nan,nan,every single video I 've made .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg252,23.14,23.19,Also hit the notification bell because otherwise,No
nan,nan,nan,YouTube might not always inform you when,No
nan,nan,nan,I will release a new video .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg253,23.2,23.31,And also I would very much appreciate you to,No
nan,nan,nan,follow me on my Instagram channel @ firmlearning,No
nan,nan,nan,On my Instagram I will share new piece of content,No
nan,nan,nan,on how you can be successful,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in the first year of your career,Structure
nan,nan,nan,every single day .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg254,23.32,23.33,So thank you for watching,Structure
nan,nan,nan,I 'm Heinrich from Firm Learning .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg255,23.34,23.34,I really enjoyed making this video for you .,No
PgOD1j2DhNg256,23.36,23.36,I hope you took something out of it a well .,Structure
PgOD1j2DhNg257,23.38,23.38,Thanks again and have a good day and stay safe .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ1,0,0.08,You 're probably tuning into this talk because you 're interested in improving your speaking skill and you know let 's face it none of u really have had a lot of explicit training,No
nan,nan,nan,in presentation a scientist . So ok we 're not expert . We may not be expert at public speaking,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ2,0.08,0.08,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ3,0.08,0.16,but I would actually suggest to you that we are all expert at listening to talk . Think about the number of hour that each of u ha sat in a chair in a lecture room,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ4,0.16,0.33,in a seminar in an auditorium listened to journal club to all kind of talk,No
nan,nan,nan,we 've spent hour and hour and hour listening to talk . So we 're expert at knowing what a good talk is because we know what we want delivered a an audience member .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ5,0.33,0.33,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ6,0.44,0.44,So if you think about it why do we go to a talk ? Well we 're interested obviously in learning some about interesting and novel science .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ7,0.52,0.58,We are going to listen to speaker who we think are credible and knowledgeable,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and doing novel work . We are responsive to speaker who are enthusiastic and who just keep u awake,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ8,0.58,1.23,and we want a talk that is well organized clear a talk that we can follow a talk that 's not laden down with jargon,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and a talk that give u enough background to understand what 's going on we want to be able to see the data understand it interpret it,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then make our own decision about the science . So we 're all expert at listening to talk why ca n't we just translate what we know,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ9,1.23,1.31,we want a an audience member into how we give a talk a individual .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ10,1.37,1.37,Let 's think about something ; how many time have we each seen a slide like this . We 've seen it a zillion time right we 're sitting there in a chair,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ11,1.37,1.46,listening to a seminar a slide like this come on . And we have no idea of what to look at .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ12,1.46,1.46,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ13,1.52,1.58,Are we supposed to read all of this text ? Are we supposed to look at this figure or that figure,No
nan,nan,nan,or that figure ? We 're overwhelmed visually and we 've all seen this slide a thousand time . Now I just want to make a quick disclaimer .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ14,1.58,1.58,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ15,2.05,2.12,This wa not my work and I 'm not suggesting for a second that the author of this really gorgeous paper,No
nan,nan,nan,would have shown a slide like that . But if I were giving a journal club on that topic I might have produced a slide like this for you,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ16,2.12,2.19,in trying to tell you about these data . So when we think about what we know instinctively is just a disaster why do we keep doing it,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ17,2.19,2.39,again and again and again ? I think that we need to know some basic rule about power point,No
nan,nan,nan,and how to structure a talk in order to enable these visuals to work effectively,Structure
nan,nan,nan,a we 're teaching a we 're speaking about our own science a we 're presenting journal club .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ18,2.45,3,So what I 'm going to do is first of all go through some basic about power point and then we 're going to think about how you structure a talk,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in order to lead a member of the audience through the data in a way that they will understand each piece that you 're presenting and,No
nan,nan,nan,be able to really understand what the take message is . First of all what font should you use ?,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ19,3,3.06,It turn out that some of the default font in power point and keynote are exactly wrong . The font you should use is a Sans Serif font .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ20,3.06,3.06,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ21,3.14,3.2,What is a Sans Serif font ? San Serif font are font without little doober line,No
nan,nan,nan,and stuff at the bottom of letter . And that 's to be contrasted with Serif font which have all the little doober at the bottom of each letter .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ22,3.2,3.2,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ23,3.28,3.39,So why do you use one and not the other ? Well visual psychophysicist have discovered that using a Sans Serif font when you 're projecting text,No
nan,nan,nan,onto a screen like this make it easier for the audience to read the text quickly . These font down here the Serif font this is the font if you have novel you were going to read it in bed,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ24,3.39,3.5,it 's very easy to read . And that 's why book are printed with Serif font but you should choose and there are a range of choice that you can make,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ25,3.5,3.59,one of the Sans Serif font for your scientific presentation . How big should your font be ?,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ26,3.59,4.04,Again be careful of some of the default font size . One of the default in Power Point is astronomically huge,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ27,4.04,4.11,bigger than this one right here it 's like 42 . It 's way too big ! You do n't need that . So the range of font size that you should use are shown here .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ28,4.11,4.11,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ29,4.11,4.11,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ30,4.19,4.19,Anywhere from 18 down to 36 with one exception . We often in our scientific presentation will want to insert a reference to a published paper,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ31,4.19,4.28,which is n't really the focus of the slide but we want to have it up there for scientific accuracy .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ32,4.34,4.34,So under those circumstance you might use a 14 point font to put your reference at the bottom of the slide .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ33,4.42,4.42,Other than that just work in this range and you 'll be good . Avoid using capital letter . This make it clear why .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ34,4.42,4.42,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ35,4.42,4.42,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ36,4.49,4.49,It 's actually really hard to read all capitol . And secondly in this age of email I think we all know that capitalizing everything,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ37,4.49,4.57,is the visual equivalent of shouting at someone . So it 's just not polite . In addition when you 're thinking about title,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ38,4.57,4.57,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ39,4.57,5.04,or how you would actually capitalize word use a sentence format . In other word do n't capitalize every word,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ40,5.04,5.11,of your title or your text down here . Having capital of every word slows down the eye and make it difficult to read .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ41,5.11,5.11,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ42,5.2,5.26,So remember the text and the slide is really there for the audience to be able to read quickly,No
nan,nan,nan,and easily . Color scheme are really important and thinking about the background of your slide .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ43,5.26,5.26,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ44,5.33,5.4,Now we 've all seen a lot of slide that have very fancy background and in fact,No
nan,nan,nan,you want the simplest possible background . For example a plain white background with dark letter,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ45,5.4,5.45,either black or blue . That work very well ; it 's high in contrast,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ46,5.45,5.51,and the only thing that appears on the slide is the information that your audience need to understand this slide in the context of your talk .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ47,5.59,5.59,Avoid using the fancy patterned background .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ48,6.05,6.05,You do n't need your company or university logo on every slide . You do not need a DNA double helix,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ49,6.05,6.11,running down every slide . All of that is extraneous . Maybe it might appear on your first slide but then get rid of it .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ50,6.11,6.11,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ51,6.11,6.11,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ52,6.18,6.18,Streamline it down to a simple a possible and think about the contrast of letter .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ53,6.24,6.24,So dark against light work really well light against dark work very well . A black background with white letter,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ54,6.24,6.3,or bright yellow . Again high contrast easy for the audience to read . When should you use which ? Well if you were to give a talk,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ55,6.3,6.3,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ56,6.3,6.49,for example at a very large symposium with hundred of people a very big room psycophysically and in term of the projector,No
nan,nan,nan,the contrast is greatest if you use a dark background and light letter under that context .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ57,6.55,6.55,So it 's easier to project at high contrast . If you 're teaching in a small room or you 're in a circumstance where you 're worried about people staying awake,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ58,6.55,7.07,then I would use a white background with dark letter . That is actually more effective .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ59,7.07,7.07,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ60,7.13,7.13,However you do want to think about your science . For example in my science I use a lot of fluorescence photomicrograph where I actually prefer a dark background,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ61,7.13,7.25,because the contrast I want people to be dark adapted so they can really see my data .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ62,7.3,7.3,So in one of my scientific seminar regardless of whether I 'm in a small room or a big room I use a black background .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ63,7.36,7.36,It just work better for my science . There are certain color combination that you should avoid . Red/green is bad :,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ64,7.36,7.36,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ65,7.36,7.44,this is incredibly difficult to look at . In addition a large fraction of the population is red color blind,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ66,7.44,7.51,and finally red is really angry color . I actually saw an entire seminar once with the background color of the slide that wa red and,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ67,7.51,8.01,I wa so agitated by ten minute into the talk so avoid that . Other color combination can be equally bad,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ68,8.01,8.16,and this is bad not because the color are unpleasant but because the contrast here is not big enough,No
nan,nan,nan,for an audience member to actually read the letter against this background . This is important because in science we 're often,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ69,8.16,8.3,creating for example these cartoon of for example of a signal transduction pathway,No
nan,nan,nan,where you want each protein to be a different color . So we 're always looking for a new color for a new protein a we 're going through,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ70,8.3,8.43,a flow of talk but we want to make sure that each protein that might in fact be this blue color,Structure
nan,nan,nan,would then have a label on top of it that 's high contrast . For example for this it might be black instead of green .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ71,8.43,8.43,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ72,8.49,8.49,Let 's think now about how to lay out a slide visually in Power Point so that it 's really easy for an audience member to follow the content of your talk .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ73,8.59,9.08,First of all I strongly recommend that every slide a heading at the top and the best heading is actually a statement a simple sentence,No
nan,nan,nan,that say in plain english what the bottom line of the slide is . Now you might say Sue excuse me this is not a statement and you 're right,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ74,9.08,9.22,ok busted this is really going through an outline for this particular talk but in my science talk,Structure
nan,nan,nan,every slide is headed by a statement . If you 're going to include text in a slide it 's very important to just limit the amount of text .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ75,9.22,9.22,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ76,9.32,9.38,I really strongly urge you to use no more than two line of text,No
nan,nan,nan,in a text block . Why is that ? The minute you show a big block of text like this I have lost you a an audience member .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ77,9.38,9.38,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ78,9.45,9.45,You do n't know at this point whether you should be reading all of this stuff or listening to me .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ79,9.51,9.56,And if you a an audience member are now distracted and confused about what you should be doing,No
nan,nan,nan,I a a speaker have lost control of my talk . So do n't use thing like this there 's one exception there might be a wonderful quotation that you want to include in your talk .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ80,9.56,9.56,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ81,10.07,10.15,For example a quote from The Double Helix or a quote from the beautiful writing of Ramon y Cajal,No
nan,nan,nan,if you 're a neurobiologist . And under those circumstance it 's great to include the full text . What I recommend you do if you do include a quotation is rather than read it word by word,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ82,10.15,10.15,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ83,10.15,10.25,instead sort of paraphrase it a you 're going along . You might say well the reason for limiting block of text to just two line is,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ84,10.25,10.32,if it go on forever people in the audience are going to have to make this huge effort to read it and that will preclude them from paying attention to what you 're saying .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ85,10.4,10.4,So you can paraphrase a quote that 's very effective unless it is very poetic and you want to do a dramatic reading and that 's fine too .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ86,10.47,10.47,Lists should be short ; try to limit your list to just three item .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ87,10.54,11.02,Avoid like mad long list and if you 're going to have a list I strongly recommend that you use the animation feature in PowerPoint,No
nan,nan,nan,to unveil your list one at a time . So when you 're talking about item one in your talk,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ88,11.02,11.07,that will appear . And only when you 're ready to talk about item two,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ89,11.07,11.12,doe that second item appear and likewise when you 're ready to include item three that will come up a well .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ90,11.18,11.18,Be very generous in a slide with empty space . It 's more effective it 's more powerful for the audience .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ91,11.18,11.18,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ92,11.26,11.26,And this is why . If you start to just load your slide with stuff it 's visually overwhelming and often you can get into a situation,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ93,11.26,11.41,we 've all been in seminar before where something is very very very close to the edge of the slide,No
nan,nan,nan,and there 's a slight misalignment between the projector and the screen that then result in stuff getting cut off .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ94,11.49,11.49,And we 've all been at talk where someone say `` oh I 'm sorry If you could have seen the slide then you would have been able to read it . '',No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ95,11.49,11.55,Well just leaving some space at the different edge the boundary of the slide and do n't forget about leaving some space at the bottom .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ96,12.03,12.11,If you 're in a room where everyone is sitting at the same level people in the back are trying to see over one another 's head,No
nan,nan,nan,so if you 're stuff is too close to bottom some people in the back ca n't see it . So leave space on all three side and a little space at the top again for the misalignment problem .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ97,12.11,12.11,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ98,12.19,12.19,Ok let 's think about the style of these slide . I urge you,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ99,12.19,12.31,most wholeheartedly to include a simple image,No
nan,nan,nan,on every slide . What most slide ? No every slide . In every slide of one of my scientific presentation there is an image .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ100,12.31,12.31,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ101,12.31,12.31,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ102,12.4,12.4,Why is that ? Here 's the deal . We audience member who are listening to a talk take in and process information,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ103,12.4,12.48,in quite different way from one another . Some of u are reader and that 's the reason for having a sentence at the top of each slide .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ104,12.48,12.48,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ105,12.57,12.57,Some of u are going to take in information by reading . Others of u are very visual . If we have an image on the slide,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ106,12.57,12.57,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ107,12.57,13.04,then that appeal to the vision we 're primate we 're very visually oriented so we communicate through picture .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ108,13.1,13.1,And the third way we talk in information is by listening . The ideal the perfect power point slide represents an absolutely,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ109,13.1,13.2,synchronous match between a simple statement at the top a simple visual and what you a a speaker are saying .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ110,13.3,13.3,So that the same content is being delivered through all three channel at the same time without any distraction .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ111,13.38,13.44,Make your slide simple limit the number of stuff you included in each slide,No
nan,nan,nan,and just make one or two point from each slide . Now we 've all heard this rule maybe most of u have heard a rule,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ112,13.44,13.58,how many slide should you show in a particular scientific presentation ? And the rule that I learned and the rule that perhaps you learned a well,No
nan,nan,nan,the rule is you show one slide per minute . So if you 're giving a twenty minute talk,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ113,13.58,14.03,you show twenty slide . I would argue now that that might have been true when slide were actually on film,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ114,14.03,14.12,and difficult to manipulate and there wa no such thing a animation . Now that we have tool like PowerPoint and Keynote,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ115,14.12,14.24,that enable u to build content progressively in slide and to have thing that are simple,No
nan,nan,nan,simple point that we can easily change from talk to talk that rule doe n't really hold anymore .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ116,14.31,14.31,And I do n't think there is a firm rule I think it really depends on the amount of information that you 're delivering in a talk .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ117,14.37,14.48,So make your slide simple do n't worry about this one slide per minute rule and rather get feedback from a you practice a talk,No
nan,nan,nan,get feedback from your colleague about whether you 're overwhelming people with too much data and number of slide .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ118,14.54,14.54,If your slide are simple you can show more than one per minute . We have all seen talk where a slide like this come up,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ119,14.54,15.08,and what doe the speaker do ? The speaker doe this the speaker say `` I know this slide is really busy but the only thing I really want you to look at,No
nan,nan,nan,is this set of data right here '' . We 've been there right ? I 've been there you 've been there .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ120,15.08,15.08,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ121,15.14,15.2,What ha the speaker just told you ? The speaker 's just said I 'm too lazy to have created a slide,No
nan,nan,nan,that is actually tailored for what I want to show you . And we a audience member are looking at all of this stuff,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ122,15.2,15.46,we even if we 're told to look at this I mean how many of u behave ? I personally I 'm looking this and I 'm wondering about that,No
nan,nan,nan,so the speaker ha not only shown a little bit of disrespect and laziness to u in my opinion,No
nan,nan,nan,but in addition the speaker ha lost u a audience member because we 're now wandering around the slide,No
nan,nan,nan,and wondering we 're having our own thought . So if you 're going to show a slide like this simply take the data that,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ123,15.46,15.53,you want to show eliminate everything else and put that up . And then explain the data completely .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ124,15.53,15.53,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ125,16.01,16.01,Explain to the audience what the ax are what each color is and remember that this is the very first time that anyone in the audience ha seen this particular graph .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ126,16.12,16.12,You 've seen it a thousand time you get it intuitively like that but they wo n't . So just show the data that you want to explain,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ127,16.12,16.19,and explain the data that you show . In other word here 's the simple rule : if you 're not going to take the time to explain it get rid of it completely .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ128,16.19,16.19,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ129,16.28,16.28,It doe n't belong there . I want to show you an example of a figure that I used to show in one of my scientific presentation .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ130,16.28,16.28,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ131,16.35,16.35,And it 's a brain and it 's got some protein and it show the distribution of those protein in the brain .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ132,16.41,16.41,It 's a pretty simple figure the content doe n't matter to u . But I want to show you what this figure looked like before I put it into the talk in this format .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ133,16.41,16.41,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ134,16.51,16.51,Here 's what the figure looked like in the actual paper that I took it from .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ135,16.56,17.12,It had all of these extra label that were extraneous I wa never going to explain that MGE stand for the medial ganglionic eminence because it 's not relevant to the talk,No
nan,nan,nan,so what did I do ? I took this figure I put it into Photoshop and I got rid of all of that,No
nan,nan,nan,leaving only a little landmark the eye to orient the audience to what we were saying .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ136,17.17,17.22,So you can take complex figure export them and simply them,No
nan,nan,nan,in order to fit perfectly with your presentation . We have all seen a lot of especially with the introduction of Keynote,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ137,17.22,17.33,some very fancy transition between slide . What do me mean by transition ? Well,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ138,17.33,17.39,in my talk so far when I 've advanced the slide you simply see the new slide . Remember when Keynote came out and the first time you were at a talk,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ139,17.39,18.04,and the speaker advanced to the next slide and the slide formed a box and the box rotated in 3 dimension and then a new slide appeared,No
nan,nan,nan,and you thought `` Oh that 's really cool that wa wild ! '' and then the speaker got their advance and they advanced to the second slide and,No
nan,nan,nan,the slide then did a big spiral and then the new slide appeared and by the third or fourth time that the speaker did that you felt nauseated .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ140,18.13,18.13,We yeah so avoid these fancy transition they are not in service of the talk . There is an exception though .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ141,18.13,18.13,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ142,18.21,18.21,There are some transition that actually illustrate in a very subtle way action . Here 's an example . This is a slide that I 've shown in some of my presentation,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ143,18.21,18.21,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ144,18.21,18.3,that have talked about the migration of neuron in the developing brain . And in this particular talk the point I wanted to make wa that we would take out neuron,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ145,18.3,18.4,from a very small region and culture them . So I used a very simple wipe transition . Watch this it 's subtle but there 's the transition .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ146,18.4,18.4,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ147,18.4,18.4,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ148,18.49,18.49,It actually wipe from one side to the other . That sort of mimic the act of taking something out of the brain and putting it into culture .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ149,18.49,18.49,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ150,18.55,19,So that 's a sensible use another sensible use would be if you 're going to zoom in on something,No
nan,nan,nan,if you 're going to zoom in on this region you might use a zoom transition . Apart from that just advance from one slide to the next with a simple transition .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ151,19,19,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ152,19.09,19.09,Do n't drown the audience with data .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ153,19.15,19.33,What make a talk memorable is when a speaker communicates,No
nan,nan,nan,a couple of take message in a way that present just enough data,No
nan,nan,nan,to be convincing but not so much data that the audience is just flooded with information,No
nan,nan,nan,and ca n't process it . Less is more and here 's a way to think about it . Those of u who are biologist,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ154,19.33,19.33,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ155,19.33,19.41,are used to culturing cell in minimum essential medium . Just enough of the critical nutrient and element and vitamin,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ156,19.41,19.55,that a cell need to survive and nothing extra . Minimum essential medium . Now if you take out any one of those element in the medium,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ157,19.55,19.55,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ158,19.55,20.05,the cell will die . Adding more doe n't add any value to your culture .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ159,20.05,20.05,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ160,20.11,20.17,So if we think about minimum essential medium we can also think about,No
nan,nan,nan,minimum essential data . Just the data that you need to convince the audience of the credibility of your science and no more .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ161,20.17,20.17,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ162,20.25,20.32,That 's really difficult and I think that 's the most difficult decision that we have to make,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in term of presenting a seminar . What is just enough ? And where 's the line between just enough and not too much .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ163,20.32,20.32,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ164,20.39,20.54,For that experience help a lot but also getting feedback from your colleague when you 're practicing your talk to ask people can I get rid of this ? What can go ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Do n't ask what can I add ask what can go ? To make this convincing and thorough,No
nan,nan,nan,and yet not too much . So I think we all realize it 's really easy to use PowerPoint badly,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ165,20.54,21.12,right ? So we 've seen a zillion example like this of people presenting journal club or seminar,Structure
nan,nan,nan,you see a slide like that we a audience member are visually overwhelmed we 're lost we do n't know what to look at,No
nan,nan,nan,we ca n't read this stuff it 's too much to read we 're distracted . The minute a slide like this go up the speaker ha lost the audience completely .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ166,21.12,21.12,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ167,21.2,21.37,So it take a lot of work do n't get me wrong it take time to use PowerPoint or Keynote effectively in a seminar because you have to think carefully,No
nan,nan,nan,about what you need to present what you NEED to present not what you want to present not what you 'd love to present but what you need to present,No
nan,nan,nan,and to present it using clear simple graphic and clear simple text . So in fact let 's go through an exercise .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ168,21.37,21.37,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ169,21.47,21.47,Let 's take that previous slide from this lovely paper from JCB which I actually presented for a journal club many year ago .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ170,21.54,21.54,Let 's take that previous slide which is figure 2 from that paper and let 's see how we can break it down into it minimum essential component .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ171,22.02,22.02,The first decision that we have to make in term of looking at all the data in this figure is what stay and what go . What 's the minimum essential data ?,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ172,22.02,22.1,What are excuse my grammatical error there what are the minimum essential data ? that we need in order to present in our journal club .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ173,22.17,22.17,And we might decide at that point that this particular part of the figure panel b can go . It 's not essential but everything else is .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ174,22.17,22.17,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ175,22.24,22.24,So how do we present that ? Well let 's deploy our PowerPoint rule in this context . First of all I 'm going show you how I 'd present panel a . Look at it for a second,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ176,22.24,22.24,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ177,22.24,22.33,it 's got some result in a gel and it 's got some image of cell . How might I do that ? Well,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ178,22.33,22.39,here 's the first figure here 's the first slide in presenting this figure . Notice that there 's a sentence at the top and then I 've taken the data,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ179,22.39,22.49,from the figure and I 've added some stuff over here . I 've added two label that help the audience,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ180,22.49,22.54,understand immediately that this is a PCR product and this is actually a Western blot .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ181,22.59,22.59,So I 've added some stuff to be helpful to the audience but I 've simplified their focus so there 's a good match between showing this and having the text .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ182,23.07,23.07,And what I would be saying if I were actually presenting a journal club . And then using a simple animation,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ183,23.07,23.13,I would then unveil the rest of this panel . And I 've added something for this audience down here,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ184,23.13,23.19,showing you that this is actually a photomicrograph of MDCK cell .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ185,23.25,23.25,So that 's panel a presented in really two part using a simple animation and some addition . The next thing I might want to show actually come from panel c,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ186,23.25,23.34,of that figure . And I 've added a bunch of stuff here to be audience friendly . First of all notice that there 's a sentence at the top a statement of what 's going on .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ187,23.34,23.34,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ188,23.34,23.34,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ189,23.44,23.5,I 'm showing just one simple panel I 've added a label and I 've added this statement to help the audience that,No
nan,nan,nan,we 're looking down at the surface of these cell . from the lumen . I 've also added some color coding so that they know what protein are visualized,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ190,23.5,23.5,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ191,23.5,24,in different color . That wa n't in the original figure I added that because who is this slide for ? It 's for the audience .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ192,24,24,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ193,24.06,24.06,The audience need this . And then using an animation we 'll then show a side view of the same cell that ' s the control cell . Now watch what happens .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ194,24.06,24.06,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ195,24.06,24.06,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ196,24.14,24.21,Two thing happen ; the sentence at the top change cause there 's a new message and we 've added the contrasting view,Structure
nan,nan,nan,of the cell that have this particular protein knocked down . Let 's now think about the last part a new sentence that really state that,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ197,24.21,24.3,this protein is essential for these cell to form little microvilli and in the absence of protein they do n't .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ198,24.37,24.44,So now we 've presented that complicated figure in a few part using some simple animation,No
nan,nan,nan,in a very audience format . So what 's the bottom line with PowerPoint ? Make simple slide simple slide that make one or two point .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ199,24.44,24.44,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ200,24.52,24.52,Build your content progressively using animation rather than present everything all at once .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ201,24.58,24.58,Just show one PowerPoint and Keynote they 're all about control . They 're controlling what people see what you 're saying and what they 're reading,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ202,24.58,25.08,and have all those match at the same time . And remember if you 're not going to talk about it just leave it out .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ203,25.08,25.08,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ204,25.15,25.15,If you 're not going to explain it it doe n't belong there at all . It go . Ok that 's what I wanted to tell you about PowerPoint I hope that 's helpful .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ205,25.15,25.15,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ206,25.15,25.15,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ207,25.24,25.24,And now we want to transition into thinking more broadly about how to structure a talk .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ208,25.31,25.31,So that it organization is clear to the audience . And I think about it a almost taking someone by the hand,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ209,25.31,25.42,and walking them through the science right and saying here 's what I want you to see now,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and here 's the path that we 're following here 's where we 've just been and here 's where we 're going . So a good talk is like a good paper it ha a structure,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ210,25.42,25.57,right a good talk start out with a big question and then we build content over time we go through the meat of the talk,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then we end with a conclusion that basically reach back out to the big issue that we started with .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ211,26.02,26.02,Same way a we write a paper why are so bad at actually doing this at talk ? Well if we discipline ourselves to do it I think we can do it better .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ212,26.1,26.25,I 'd like to show you an example from one of my own seminar of how I actually structure an introduction to define the really big question,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then give enough background information to enable the audience to be able to follow the meat of the talk,Structure
nan,nan,nan,in the middle . And a I 'm doing that I also want to show you a trick that I 've learned,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ213,26.25,26.31,that I think is extraordinarily effective at giving good talk .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ214,26.36,26.36,And that 's an idea that I call something like a home slide or a home image . It 's a picture,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ215,26.36,26.5,maybe a cartoon an image of some sort that is going to signal to the audience,No
nan,nan,nan,that you 're at a point in the talk where you 're going to make a transition . It 's a little signal to the audience to perk up because you 're going to tell them where you 've just been,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ216,26.5,26.59,what it mean and where you 're going next . So a I show you the introduction to one of my talk,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ217,26.59,27.09,I 'm going to build up into a home slide that you 'll see a little bit later,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is going to come up again and again and again at transition . You might feel a little bit jarred because now the background of the slide is going to change from white to black,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ218,27.09,27.16,and this jarred feeling that you might experience is one of the reason that I think it 's actually quite important in a talk to keep the same color background throughout the entire thing .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ219,27.25,27.25,So here we go . So here 's the first slide from my standard seminar and notice first of all that my name and institution appear right here .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ220,27.25,27.25,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ221,27.32,27.39,Why is that ? Well because people in the audience may be taking note and they might want to write down your name and they 'll want to know how to spell it correctly,No
nan,nan,nan,so it 's a courtesy to them . So a I start in my talk I start to discus,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ222,27.39,27.55,a kind of analogy between the brain which is what we study and a computer chip because each of them ha to make really specific connection with one another,No
nan,nan,nan,the brain during development and the computer chip in a factory . And I make kind of a joke and see if people laugh and gauge the humor level of my audience at that point .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ223,27.55,27.55,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ224,28.03,28.22,And then I show the audience the cell that I actually work on the actual circuitry of the brain,No
nan,nan,nan,that my lab study in the cerebral cortex and then I frame the major question that my lab is interested in,Structure
nan,nan,nan,which really ha to do with the question of how it is that these individual neuron in the brain know,Structure
nan,nan,nan,what kind of connection to form what are the molecular mechanism that guide those choice about cell fate and connectivity .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ225,28.29,28.42,At this point then I introduce the two cell type that the talk will focus on,Structure
nan,nan,nan,two set of neuron that you 'll see have different color and then I introduce two question that the talk will address,Structure
nan,nan,nan,during the course of the next however long it is maybe a forty minute seminar . One question having to do with the fate of the yellow cell,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ226,28.42,28.5,and another question having to do with the fate of the blue cell . And that basically then launch me into the actual data part of the talk .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ227,28.5,28.5,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ228,29.02,29.07,This particular image right here is the `` home image '',No
nan,nan,nan,or the home slide that I wa referring to just a minute ago . And a you 'll see this image is going to reappear again and again and again,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ229,29.07,29.16,in my talk during transition . And we 'll see just in a couple of minute how that can get played out,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ230,29.16,29.21,and how it can be extraordinarily effective in enabling the audience to follow a talk .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ231,29.27,29.27,Ok so now we 've built up an introduction and we 're ready for the middle right ? So we 're ready for the middle of the talk which is the meat .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ232,29.34,29.34,But there 's a problem . And that is that audience have fairly limited attention span .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ233,29.34,29.34,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ234,29.42,29.42,This is an interesting graph so let 's look at a little bit of data . This is a plot of the percentage of a class that 's paying full attention to a lecturer,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ235,29.42,29.52,over the time during which the lecture is being delivered . Ok there 's some good news right ?,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ236,29.52,29.57,The good news is right here in your introduction people are actually kinda tuned in and listening . And here 's the bad news which is that ok let 's face it,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ237,29.57,30.2,depending on how compelling the lecturer is it might be here or it might be way down there,Structure
nan,nan,nan,but the bottom line is that at no under no circumstance are you ever going to get,Structure
nan,nan,nan,100 % audience attention for your entire talk . Why is that ? Well think about being a member of the audience .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ238,30.2,30.2,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ239,30.28,30.5,Why doe this happen ? It 's because we 're human ! We have thought we have thought that intrude on our attention span,No
nan,nan,nan,we have thought about oh my gosh did I remember to load that gel or turn off the power supply,No
nan,nan,nan,we have thought about whether we actually are going to be on time getting the kid from daycare,No
nan,nan,nan,we have thought about someone we just met you know we have all these random thought that intrude so we 're human and we 're going to space out .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ240,30.58,30.58,We then a speaker have two choice one is we could say eh ok someone spaced out take no prisoner you spaced out forget it .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ241,31.06,31.06,You 're just never going to understand anything else I say . Or we can just acknowledge the fact that the audience is human,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ242,31.06,31.13,that every single member of an audience is going to tune out at some point .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ243,31.19,31.19,And we can build in a mechanism within our talk to enable them to catch up .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ244,31.24,31.24,So obviously I kind of recommend the latter . So if the middle is the meat of the talk and it 's the time when the audience is going to zone out at some point,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ245,31.24,31.33,why ? Because they 're just people ! Well what are we going to do about it ? What I suggest you do is to visualize the middle of the talk in the following way .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ246,31.45,31.59,You 're going to have a series of episode or data dive,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that you 're going to present little story and a you 're presenting a particular story you 're going to start at a level,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that 's fairly untechnical and you might actually get pretty deep into the data . To a level that 's really going to appeal really just to specialist in your field .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ247,31.59,31.59,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ248,32.07,32.18,Now if we were to give a talk and start presenting our data and we 've all been at seminar where people do this,Structure
nan,nan,nan,where we just go down into depth and then we just do data data data data data data data data,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then we conclude and it 's over we 've lost people along the way . So this structure this visual structure here is a way of planning your talk,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ249,32.18,32.5,so that you can think about diving down into data and then coming up for air,No
nan,nan,nan,and it 's at these transition point between data dive that you use your home image to basically let the audience member,No
nan,nan,nan,catch up and know where you 've just been what you 're concluding from that part of the data,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and where you 're going to go next . So let 's look at an example of one of those data dive from one of my seminar .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ250,32.5,32.5,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ251,32.57,33.03,You 've already seen the introduction to the seminar you 've already seen how I introduced,No
nan,nan,nan,my home slide . At this point in my talk I 've gone through a review of the literature,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ252,33.03,33.08,the first data dive and I 'm now beginning part two of the talk . And here 's the beginning of that section . So once again you see,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ253,33.08,33.08,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ254,33.08,33.15,this home image and you see the two question . We 're half way through the talk but I 'm summarizing part one,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ255,33.15,33.2,and getting ready to introduce the second set of question . At this point then I now start to explain that a we focus on the blue cell,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ256,33.2,33.33,that we 're going to be looking at the role of a separate protein that is actually expressed in a subset of neuron within the different layer .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ257,33.42,33.49,And then I explain that we 've generated knock mouse in which we 've inserted a reporter into the cell that normally express this protein,Structure
nan,nan,nan,so that we can see their axonal connection . And now we do n't really need to focus on the data but look there 's a sentence,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ258,33.49,34.05,at the top that basically say what I just told you then we see a simple figure from the control in which I would point out that what I want the audience to look at,No
nan,nan,nan,are the blue axon that label the connection between the two hemisphere . That 's in the control then we look at the mutant the thing I 'm going to emphasize,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ259,34.05,34.13,is the absence of those connection here . Now we 're going to look at it from the side same stuff sentence two simple image,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ260,34.13,34.2,word will match the content were I really delivering the seminar to you . And then I tell you what I told just told you .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ261,34.2,34.2,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ262,34.28,34.34,I just told you that the blue cell express this protein that they form this type of connection,No
nan,nan,nan,and then I say you know in the first part of the talk I told you about another pathway .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ263,34.39,34.5,So you might be wondering what is the relationship between these two pathway ? So then I will go on to actually test that connection by presenting more data,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that would then build up into a small conclusion slide showing you that this protein represses the expression of this gene .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ264,34.58,35.04,So simple graphic that really emphasize the bottom line,No
nan,nan,nan,the story that I 'm telling you with the minimum essential data . Ok so we 've gone through the meat thinking about data dive coming back making transition .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ265,35.04,35.04,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ266,35.13,35.13,Now let 's think about how to conclude a talk . Here 's the good news is that a you say,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ267,35.13,35.18,and now in conclusion look what happens to the attention level of your audience . It 's like oh it 's over hey I better see what I just saw .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ268,35.18,35.18,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ269,35.28,35.28,So that 's good news now you 've got one more really good chance to deliver your take to the audience effectively .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ270,35.34,35.46,There 's a danger to this though a well and that 's the danger of hearing,Structure
nan,nan,nan,for example forty minute into a talk someone say `` Oh to conclude '',Structure
nan,nan,nan,and our we 're like `` oh good you know actually they 're ending twenty minute early that 's great I can actually get a little bit more work done today . '',No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ271,35.46,36,So they say in conclusion blah blah blah blah blah blah and then they say `` and now in part two of my talk '' and what 's our response a an audience ?,Structure
nan,nan,nan,We 're like `` oooh dude no '' . Why is that ? It 's because it wa a false ending . And it got u all excited . So if you 're going to conclude part one of your talk,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ272,36,36,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ273,36,36,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ274,36,36.08,do the audience of favor of saying to some sum up this first part of the seminar and that way you wo n't create a false expectation .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ275,36.16,36.28,But the good news is you will perk up interest a you signal your conclusion and that mean that you have one last chance to really reiterate your specific conclusion,No
nan,nan,nan,and most of u remember to do that . But it 's easy to forget to sort of back out to the big picture .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ276,36.28,36.28,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ277,36.34,36.43,And return to the beginning to have your talk come full circle so that you 're really ending by revisiting the big question,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that you introduced at the very first part of the talk . So again here 's how I would do it in my talk just a a visual,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ278,36.43,36.5,example of how one might think about this . Concluding up now sentence at the top the same diagram that you 've seen before,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ279,36.5,37.04,about this repression and now adding other thing you have n't seen in the data but I would add that just to remind them,Structure
nan,nan,nan,that at least one of these mechanism work through the modulation of chromatin they would have seen that slide already .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ280,37.1,37.1,I would then connect it back to the first part of the talk and talk about a little switch that had gotten set up .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ281,37.16,37.23,I would then refer back even earlier to a part of the talk that you did n't see now going back to the really big picture,Structure
nan,nan,nan,question about how different type of neuron emerge over time . Many of these question are still unanswered and therefore represent a frontier in my field .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ282,37.23,37.23,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ283,37.33,37.46,I would then wrap up by acknowledging of course the colleague that have contributed to the work over time,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and then here 's a trick a you get to the very end of your talk rather than leaving up your acknowledgement slide,Structure
nan,nan,nan,have your conclusion slide appear at the very end . For the question and answer period .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ284,37.46,37.46,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ285,37.51,37.51,Why is that ? Well it help the audience . Remember everything is in service of the audience and I actually have the misfortune,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ286,37.51,37.58,of working on three gene all of which have name that end in two and none of which are memorable by anyone who doe n't work on them .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ287,38.05,38.05,So by putting this picture up I 'm enabling the audience to actually ask intelligent question .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ288,38.12,38.18,First you know if they 're struggling to remember which gene they had a question about and secondly when I 'm answering a question,No
nan,nan,nan,I can actually use the visuals to explain my answer . And that turn out to be very helpful . So I really recommend that at the end of your talk,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ289,38.18,38.18,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ290,38.18,38.26,during Q and A put your summary slide back up again . It 's helpful for you and for the people attending your talk .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ291,38.26,38.26,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ292,38.32,38.32,Ok so what have I just told you about organizing a great talk ? First of all use PowerPoint wisely .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ293,38.4,38.4,Have very clean minimal slide . Secondly start out with a broad introduction so that everyone in the audience,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ294,38.4,38.55,understands the big question that are compelling in your field and then introduce the specific gradually,Structure
nan,nan,nan,giving them just enough background information so that they can follow the data but not so much that they 're overwhelmed .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ295,39.01,39.27,Third think of the talk a consisting of these episode or little data dive in which you 're going to go,Structure
nan,nan,nan,at a point into your data remember the minimum essential data and then you 're going to go into some depth but then you come up for air,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and allow the audience to regroup see where you 've just been frame the next question and then get there logically rather than just going through data data data data,Structure
nan,nan,nan,which wa just going to leave people in the dust . A very effective way of making these transition explicit,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ296,39.27,39.45,is to design a home slide or a home image that is a signal to the audience that you 're at a point of transition,No
nan,nan,nan,and they will perk up and it will help them to understand the flow of your talk . And finally your conclusion here is just the opposite of the introduction .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ297,39.45,39.45,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ298,39.53,39.53,You start more specific with what you 've learned but then end up broad again . So is this all you need to know to give a great talk ?,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ299,39.53,40.16,No way ! Right ? I mean these are just some basic rule or suggestion or advice,Structure
nan,nan,nan,about how to create slide that are user audience and how to structure your talk so that it 's well organized and very very clear,No
nan,nan,nan,and simple for an audience to follow . But there are a lot of thing that go into giving a great talk .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ300,40.16,40.16,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ301,40.22,40.22,There 's the whole performance aspect of speaking . There 's the actual scientific content,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ302,40.22,40.28,but at least in term of performance you can practice that you can and should rehearse your talk .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ303,40.36,40.51,In fact the entire time from the first day of graduate school all the way well into being a tenured professor,Structure
nan,nan,nan,at Stanford I rehearsed every talk every lecture,No
nan,nan,nan,every journal club that I gave . Every one of them . And finally I got so comfortable with speaking I do n't actually have to do it anymore .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ304,40.51,40.51,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ305,40.51,40.51,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ306,40.58,41.04,But that mean rehearsing out loud and often in front of an audience dozen and dozen and dozen of talk,No
nan,nan,nan,get feedback and practice the way you 're going to speak . Have the word rehearsed and get some input from your colleague,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ307,41.04,41.13,about whether you 've identified effectively the minimum essential data for the talk .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ308,41.18,41.18,Secondly have yourself videotaped . Go and watch yourself and see what you do . See if you 're gesturing naturally and so on .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ309,41.18,41.18,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ310,41.18,41.18,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ311,41.24,41.29,So those kind of aspect of delivery are much more effectively done one on one,No
nan,nan,nan,rather than through a format like this . Another great resource that I highly recommend is a wonderful book by Michael Alley,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ312,41.29,41.37,called The Craft of Scientific Presentations . If you 're going to have just a single book on scientific presentation in your bookshelf I personally would recommend this one .,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ313,41.37,41.37,nan,No
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ314,41.46,41.46,It 's a terrific model and it 's actually the basis of a lot the information that I 've presented to you today .,Structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ315,41.51,41.51,Well that 's it ! Thank you so much I hope this ha been helpful and I wish you every success with your talk in the future .,Structure
1VCaJ4dSHak1,0.01,0.01,Using gesture when give a public speech is a very important part of your presentation .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak2,0.07,0.18,If you fail to use gesture properly and you do awkward gesture throughout your presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,you are probably going to distract your audience and you are not going to get the impact that,No
nan,nan,nan,you want when you presenting .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak3,0.21,0.36,So what are four gesture that we use and how can we use them and use them effectively,No
nan,nan,nan,during our presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,Hi I am Ryan McLean and I am from publicspeakingpower.com where we teach people like you how to become,No
nan,nan,nan,powerful public speaker .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak4,0.38,0.44,So I am going to walk you through the four gesture that you can use in your presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,and so you can become more powerful and effective public speaker .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak5,0.49,1.06,Gesture number one are descriptive Gestures so these are gesture that we are using to,No
nan,nan,nan,describe something or situation .We might draw comparison between something thats,Structure
nan,nan,nan,really big and something thats really small or we might use it to contrast certain item,No
nan,nan,nan,or to depict the size .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak6,1.08,1.19,A great example that I am taking from toy master is if you are using a metaphor something,No
nan,nan,nan,is like a tiny little bird and you are holding like cup stand stating the metaphor of the,No
nan,nan,nan,bird and also implying size being small .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak7,1.22,1.31,You can also use descriptive gesture to say shape say it wa the box this big back,No
nan,nan,nan,these and you showing square shape of the box using your gesture .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak8,1.36,1.52,You can also talk about movement so moving from here to there picking up a box you,No
nan,nan,nan,can talk about location the table wa over here and there wa magazine on the table and,No
nan,nan,nan,you can even talk about the number like I said four different gesture that we are going,No
nan,nan,nan,to use .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak9,1.53,2.09,So descriptive gesture are very helpful because when we are speaking all we have is our word,No
nan,nan,nan,all we have is what come out of our mouth and by using descriptive gesture we can,No
nan,nan,nan,actually improve the impact and improve the comprehension of our audience so that our,No
nan,nan,nan,message get across more effectively .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak10,2.13,2.13,Number two is Emphatic gesture that a confusing word so let me explain it .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak11,2.19,2.25,Emphatic gesture are like emotional gesture so if we are sad we could slump down and talk,No
nan,nan,nan,about thing sad and we are angry we could put our fist together and make angry face .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak12,2.3,3.03,So we can use these gesture to symbolise the feeling that we have and that also emphatic,No
nan,nan,nan,gesture help u in more genuine so what are you talking about I am so angry when,No
nan,nan,nan,this happened and we are using this angry gesture it actually give more humph to our,No
nan,nan,nan,presentation and make sing more genuine yes he were angry I can see his body language,No
nan,nan,nan,he wa angry but if you were saying Yeah I wa really angry and your body language,No
nan,nan,nan,is just slumped and you kind of look depressed well may be they are not going to believe,No
nan,nan,nan,that you are actually angry .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak13,3.04,3.04,So actually it give make your presentation look more genuine .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak14,3.09,3.22,Number three a Suggestive gesture so these are the thing like mood an expression,No
nan,nan,nan,for example : you could say I welcome you in with open arm since you got your open palm,No
nan,nan,nan,symbolises that you are open .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak15,3.23,3.4,So you could say that this guy in audience who wa just wont listen to anything else,No
nan,nan,nan,or saying he just NO and you are crossing your arm and you kind of you are suggesting,No
nan,nan,nan,that even though he may be crossing his arm he wa closed off that wa the vibe that,No
nan,nan,nan,he wa giving off the emotion that he wa giving off .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak16,3.44,3.53,You could do lot of other thing like striking your shoulder you know NAHH !,No
nan,nan,nan,Who care or you could also you know even show your back and when there you just dint,No
nan,nan,nan,care about I wa talking about .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak17,3.56,4.06,Last one number four is Prompting Gestures ; So these are the one that prompt the audience,No
nan,nan,nan,to do something so what I am going to take Tony Robbins doe this really well he might,Structure
nan,nan,nan,say raise your hand if you want to earn million dollar this year .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak18,4.1,4.15,And so I am raising my hand a I am telling people to raise their hand hence they are,No
nan,nan,nan,more likely to do it .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak19,4.16,4.16,Or you could say let get warmed up everyone let s jump up and down on the spot .,No
1VCaJ4dSHak20,4.22,4.27,So you can see in the video I am jumping and so it encourages audience or prompt them,No

1VCaJ4dSHak28,5.29,5.41,If it take you away from what you are saying like scratching your face adjusting clothes,No
nan,nan,nan,playing with your ring figure than probably they will take you away from the presentation,No

h6sm47j-Am41,0,0.04,I have often heard professional speaker say,No
nan,nan,nan,you should start your presentation with a joke .,No
h6sm47j-Am42,0.07,0.09,That attention grabber is critical,No
nan,nan,nan,and I wan na disagree with this advice .,No
h6sm47j-Am43,0.12,0.2,I do not recommend telling a setup punchline joke,No
nan,nan,nan,the kind that a stand comic would tell,No
nan,nan,nan,and there are a lotta reason why .,No
h6sm47j-Am44,0.21,0.32,Now at the same time I am 100 % in favor,No
nan,nan,nan,of using lighthearted humor in a presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,and I do it often when I do professional presentation,No
nan,nan,nan,and when I teach in college .,No
h6sm47j-Am45,0.34,0.37,So there are some difference here,Structure
nan,nan,nan,but I can give you a really straight ahead way,No
nan,nan,nan,to add humor without the big risk of a punchline joke .,No
h6sm47j-Am46,0.41,0.41,So let 's take a look .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am47,0.47,0.47,Hi I 'm Alex Lyon and this is Communication Coach .,No
h6sm47j-Am48,0.5,0.52,We 're here to help you increase your impact,No
nan,nan,nan,and lead your team to higher level of excellence .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am49,0.56,0.59,Lotta bad advice out there in my humble opinion,Structure
nan,nan,nan,about telling joke a attention grabber .,No
h6sm47j-Am410,1.02,1.02,Here is the most common situation that I have seen .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am411,1.06,1.09,The speaker try to start off with a joke,No
nan,nan,nan,that they have created and then nobody laugh .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am412,1.12,1.18,And then instead of just moving on,Structure
nan,nan,nan,they start chuckling nervously to cue people,No
nan,nan,nan,that that wa a joke .,No
h6sm47j-Am413,1.19,1.22,The audience may or may not chuckle nervously,No
nan,nan,nan,and it 's an incredibly awkward situation .,No
h6sm47j-Am414,1.26,1.32,Now think about this this is the first moment,No
nan,nan,nan,of your presentation and you completely bombed,No
nan,nan,nan,and there are nothing but cricket and nervous laughter .,No
h6sm47j-Am415,1.35,1.35,This is not the way you want to start a presentation .,No
h6sm47j-Am416,1.38,1.38,It 's really high risk and really low reward .,No
h6sm47j-Am417,1.42,1.46,So I am against these stand comic setup,No
nan,nan,nan,and punchline one joke .,No
h6sm47j-Am418,1.48,1.5,Now having said that I 'm gon na sound,No
nan,nan,nan,like I 'm contradicting myself but I am not .,No
h6sm47j-Am419,1.53,1.56,There 's a lot of way to add humor,No
nan,nan,nan,to your attention grabber without the big risk .,No
h6sm47j-Am420,2,2.05,So let 's look at three easy way to add,No
nan,nan,nan,some lighthearted humor and still grab,No
nan,nan,nan,your audience 's attention .,No
h6sm47j-Am421,2.07,2.1,The first way is to deliberately quote,No
nan,nan,nan,someone else that 's funny .,No
h6sm47j-Am422,2.12,2.22,Now by quoting them directly by saying a Jerry Seinfeld,Structure
nan,nan,nan,once said or a George Burns once said,Structure
nan,nan,nan,then you may even have the piece of paper in your hand,No
nan,nan,nan,and read the quotation .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am423,2.25,2.28,What you 're doing there is you 're drawing,No
nan,nan,nan,people 's attention to what that other person said,No
nan,nan,nan,and it take the attention off of you a the joke teller .,No
h6sm47j-Am424,2.31,2.31,So you know they have a funny line that kill .,No
h6sm47j-Am425,2.34,2.34,It 's already been tested .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am426,2.36,2.37,They 're stand comic they probably worked on it,No
nan,nan,nan,for year to get it just right .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am427,2.39,2.44,And now you 're both you and your audience,Structure
nan,nan,nan,focusing on that little line,No
nan,nan,nan,that little humor a an object that you 're both looking at .,No
h6sm47j-Am428,2.47,2.47,So the attention 's not on you .,No
h6sm47j-Am429,2.48,2.55,And if it bomb which they usually do n't,No
nan,nan,nan,because if they 're funny they 're funny,No
nan,nan,nan,because it 's already been worked out,Structure
nan,nan,nan,then what you do is you get a little chuckle,No
nan,nan,nan,you get a little laugh .,No
h6sm47j-Am430,2.56,2.56,But if it bomb then it 's not really on you .,No
h6sm47j-Am431,2.59,2.59,It 's on George Burns it 's on Jerry Seinfeld .,No
h6sm47j-Am432,3.01,3.05,I wa saying to my wife the other day,No
nan,nan,nan,you know Jerry Seinfeld said in his bit,No
nan,nan,nan, My parent just moved to Florida .,No
h6sm47j-Am433,3.08,3.09, Now they did n't wan na move to Florida,No
nan,nan,nan, but they 're 65 and that 's the law . '',No
h6sm47j-Am434,3.09,3.12,And my wife laughed huge .,No
h6sm47j-Am435,3.14,3.28,I 'm always trying to make my wife laugh,No
nan,nan,nan,but she laugh when I tell Jerry Seinfeld joke,No
nan,nan,nan,and I think it 's because you can hear the comedian,No
nan,nan,nan,telling the joke in your mind a the person share it,No
nan,nan,nan,and it transport you a little bit more,No
nan,nan,nan,than hearing me Alex Lyon a the speaker,No
nan,nan,nan,tell my one joke .,No
h6sm47j-Am436,3.29,3.29,So quote someone else that 's funny .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am437,3.31,3.31,Use a quotation .,No
h6sm47j-Am438,3.32,3.32,That 's a great attention grabber no problem .,No
h6sm47j-Am439,3.34,3.36,The other way you can add humor is by telling,No
nan,nan,nan,a lighthearted story .,No
h6sm47j-Am440,3.38,3.5,And the way to make a story lighthearted,Structure
nan,nan,nan,and by the way I have a whole nother video,No
nan,nan,nan,on how to tell story a attention grabber,No
nan,nan,nan,I 'll put that link in the description below,Structure
nan,nan,nan,is you add a little bit of a goal to the person,No
nan,nan,nan,in the story .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am441,3.51,4.01,They 're trying to reach a destination,Structure
nan,nan,nan,achieve something and that way your story get humorous,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because the obstacle along the way prevent them,No
nan,nan,nan,from reaching that goal and it becomes,Structure
nan,nan,nan,pretty lighthearted pretty funny .,No
h6sm47j-Am442,4.02,4.16,That 's the whole reason why a movie like Dumb and Dumber,No
nan,nan,nan,is funny because it 's a road trip movie,No
nan,nan,nan,where these two guy are trying to get from A to B,Structure
nan,nan,nan,from Providence to Aspen to see about a girl,No
nan,nan,nan,and everything that can go wrong doe go wrong,Structure
nan,nan,nan,on their way .,No
h6sm47j-Am443,4.16,4.24,And so all these mishap become very humorous,No
nan,nan,nan,because you know there 's a goal in mind,No
nan,nan,nan,that is preventing and they 're being prevented,Structure
nan,nan,nan,from getting there .,No
h6sm47j-Am444,4.24,4.27,So adding a little bit of a humorous goal,No
nan,nan,nan,to your story can make that story more lighthearted .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am445,4.3,4.3,So you can tell a story .,No
h6sm47j-Am446,4.3,4.35,It 's not a punchline but it add just a little bit,No
nan,nan,nan,of a chuckle a little bit of a smile,No
nan,nan,nan,to your audience 's experience .,No
h6sm47j-Am447,4.37,4.41,And the third way is really easy,No
nan,nan,nan,and that is to show something visual,No
nan,nan,nan,on the screen that you know is funny .,No
h6sm47j-Am448,4.44,4.49,So maybe there 's a cute picture,No
nan,nan,nan,maybe there 's a little bit of a joke even on the slide,No
nan,nan,nan,and you do n't have to tell it .,No
h6sm47j-Am449,4.5,4.52,You just have to say something and then show the image,No
nan,nan,nan,and people chuckle .,No
h6sm47j-Am450,4.53,4.53,You 've probably seen speaker use humor this way .,No
h6sm47j-Am451,4.56,5.02,It 's a very low way because when you were looking,No
nan,nan,nan,at the internet or doing your reading,No
nan,nan,nan,you came across it and you laughed,No
nan,nan,nan,or somebody forward it to you and you laughed .,No
h6sm47j-Am452,5.04,5.04,Everybody think it 's funny .,No
h6sm47j-Am453,5.05,5.05,Everyone know it 's funny .,No
h6sm47j-Am454,5.06,5.08,And so you share it in a presentation and it 's almost,Structure
nan,nan,nan,guaranteed to get a smile .,No
h6sm47j-Am455,5.11,5.27,So I am 100 % telling your own setup,Structure
nan,nan,nan,punchline joke but I am also 100 % in favor,No
nan,nan,nan,of using lighthearted humor and these are three,No
nan,nan,nan,low way to do it without worrying,No
nan,nan,nan,about nobody laughing,No
nan,nan,nan,and just hearing those cricket chirping .,No
h6sm47j-Am456,5.29,5.29,That 's a really hard way to start a presentation .,No
h6sm47j-Am457,5.32,5.37,And trust me I 've seen a lotta people crash and burn,No
nan,nan,nan,and they just completely fall apart,Structure
nan,nan,nan,because they 're trying to do it that way .,No
h6sm47j-Am458,5.39,5.48,So question of the day what are your suggestion,Structure
nan,nan,nan,for adding humor but not joke to your attention grabber,No
nan,nan,nan,in your presentation ?,No
nan,nan,nan,I would love to hear your comment and your question,No
nan,nan,nan,in that section below .,Structure
h6sm47j-Am459,5.51,5.54,So thanks god bless and I hope you grab,Structure
nan,nan,nan,your audience 's attention really well,No
