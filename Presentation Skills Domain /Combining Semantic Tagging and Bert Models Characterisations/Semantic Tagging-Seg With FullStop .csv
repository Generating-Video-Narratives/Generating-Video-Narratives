yoD8RMq2OkU1,0,0.07,Transcriber : eric vautier Reviewer : Helene Vernet,,,,,,,
,,,Most people who come to speak at TED are here because they ’ ve succeeded .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU2,0.13,0.13,I ’ m here because I haven ’ t .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU3,0.17,0.23,For the last ten year,,,,,,,
,,,I ’ ve been helping conference speaker business leader entrepreneur,,,,,,,
,,,to prepare and deliver powerful presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU4,0.27,0.3,And in those same ten year TED ha shown,,,,,,,
,,,that presentation can and should be both enjoyable and effective .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU5,0.37,0.47,But ten year on,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,despite TED and despite my best effort at school conference and company,,,,,,,
,,,most presentation still do this to their audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU6,0.53,0.55,So have I failed ?,,,,,,,
,,,No ! I just have n't succeeded yet .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU7,0.59,1.04,And to succeed in making all presentation resonate with their audience,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,I need your help .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU8,1.06,1.06,That ’ s why I ’ m here .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU9,1.08,1.09,So I ’ d like to share with you,,,,,,,
,,,the three magic ingredient of powerful presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU10,1.15,1.15,OK let ’ s just pause there for a moment .,Pause,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU11,1.18,1.18,I ’ ve told you what I ’ m going to say .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU12,1.21,1.31,The question you should be asking is :,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,, So what ? What ’ s in it for me ? Why should I care ? '',,,,,,,
,,,And that is a really important question,,,,,,,
,,,because the first magic ingredient is in fact the audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU13,1.36,1.36,The audience is the magic ingredient in every presentation .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU14,1.39,1.39,This is not my talk it ’ s yours .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU15,1.42,1.45,Every presentation should be made to measure,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,for a specific audience in a specific context .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU16,1.49,1.58,So why should you care about the magic ingredient of great presentation ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well it 's very important right ?,,,,,,,
,,,It ’ s really important to understand that we all have to listen to presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU17,2.03,2.18,Wouldn ’ t it be great if they weren ’ t all so boring ?,,,,,,,
,,,But we don ’ t just listen to presentation,,,,,,,
,,,we also have to give presentations right ?,,,,,,,
,,,How many of you ever have to give presentation ?,,,,,,,
,,,I think if we ’ re honest we all do .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU18,2.21,2.32,Sooner or later at school or at work,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and also in interview,,,,,,,
,,,we all have to present with or without slide,,,,,,,
,,,and it ’ s how well we present,,,,,,,
,,,that will make a huge difference to how well we succeed .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU19,2.36,2.36,That ’ s why you should care .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU20,2.39,2.39,So that ’ s the first magic ingredient : the audience .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU21,2.42,2.42,Always make it special for them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU22,2.46,2.46,The second magic ingredient is the speaker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU23,2.5,2.52,Now you ’ re probably looking at me and thinking :,,,,,,,
,,,“ Well Phil not very magical . ”,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU24,2.52,3.02,Thanks by the way !,,,,,,,
,,,But it ’ s really important that you put something of yourself in there,,,,,,,
,,,something only you can say .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU25,3.05,3.14,This doesn ’ t mean you tell them what you had for breakfast,,,,,,,
,,,but it doe mean that if someone else,,,,,,,
,,,could give the exact same presentation in your place,,,,,,,
,,,then you didn ’ t put anything personal into it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU26,3.16,3.2,And that matter because when you share,,,,,,,
,,,we care .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU27,3.21,3.21,So show why you care why it ’ s important to you .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU28,3.25,3.25,Tell u example and story from your experience .,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU29,3.29,3.29,And that will make it more personal and more memorable .,Memorable,Impact,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU30,3.33,3.36,So those are the first two magic ingredient :,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,the audience and the speaker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU31,3.38,3.41,I know it doesn ’ t sound very magical,Sound,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,but you ’ d be amazed how many presentation have neither of them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU32,3.46,3.46,So the third magic ingredient is transformation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU33,3.5,3.56,Now most presentation aim only to inform their audience,Aim,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,and it doesn ’ t work very well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU34,3.58,4.05,Let me take out my magic wand because I ’ m going to do a disappearing trick,,,,,,,
,,,because like this guy,,,,,,,
,,,we forget most of what we hear very quickly indeed .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU35,4.11,4.15,But good presentation are not about information,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,they are about transformation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU36,4.17,4.22,They are about changing something in what your audience belief,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,in what they feel in what they do .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU37,4.25,4.28,Imagine you are making a pitch,Pitch,Tone,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,for raising fund for a project or a start .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU38,4.32,4.36,After your pitch the audience know everything they need to know,Pitch,Tone,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,but they don ’ t fund you .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU39,4.38,4.39,Did you succeed ?,,,,,,,
,,,No .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU40,4.41,4.53,Now imagine that after your pitch your audience doe give you the fund,Pitch,Tone,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,because they feel confident and trusting,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,and they believe that your project will be successful,Confident,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,and that it is a good investment .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU41,4.55,4.55,All of that is not information it ’ s transformation .,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU42,5,5.05,So it ’ s easy for me to say “ Don ’ t inform transform ! ”,,,,,,,
,,,but how ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well every magician need a magic wand and here is yours .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU43,5.1,5.1,It ’ s called the  Audience Transformation Roadmap . '',Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU44,5.1,5.26,This is a really simple but amazingly powerful technique,Objective,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,to understand what your transformational objective are,,,,,,,
,,,and then to brainstorm,,,,,,,
,,,what you can say show and do to transform your audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU45,5.3,5.3,So here ’ s how it work .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU46,5.33,5.37,To understand how to take your audience on a transformational journey,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,you first need to work out where they are starting from .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU47,5.4,5.57,So we ask ourselves four simple question :,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,What doe my audience know before my presentation ?,,,,,,,
,,,What do they know about the subject ?,,,,,,,
,,,What do they believe ?,,,,,,,
,,,And what do they feel ?,,,,,,,
,,,Now the difference between the two,,,,,,,
,,,is believing is something you think and feeling is an emotion .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU48,6,6.04,So for example I believe it ’ s time for dinner,,,,,,,
,,,I feel hungry .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU49,6.06,6.07,See the difference ?,,,,,,,
,,,Right .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU50,6.08,6.16,So what do they know believe and feel and lastly what do they do ?,,,,,,,
,,,Now this could be nothing maybe they do nothing relevant,,,,,,,
,,,or maybe they do something that you need to change .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU51,6.21,6.23,So once you ’ ve worked out where they are before,,,,,,,
,,,you can then take them to where you want them to go afterwards .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU52,6.26,6.26,And we ask the same four question but in the reverse order .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU53,6.31,6.31,So now we know what they do before .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU54,6.32,6.52,What do we want them to do after the presentation ?,,,,,,,
,,,What do they need to feel ?,,,,,,,
,,,What should they believe differently to feel and do those thing ?,,,,,,,
,,,And lastly what do they need to know ?,,,,,,,
,,,And when you follow this process,,,,,,,
,,,you realize very quickly that the real transformation,,,,,,,
,,,are not in what they know it ’ s in what they believe and feel and do .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU55,6.56,6.56,That ’ s what make the difference .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU56,6.59,7.1,Once we ’ ve understood where they are and where we need to take them,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,then we can fill in the Transformation Column,,,,,,,
,,,with all of the idea on what we can say in our presentation,,,,,,,
,,,to make those transformation in our audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU57,7.13,7.13,And that give u the content of the presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU58,7.17,7.3,Clear so far ?,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,Maybe we should take an example so let ’ s take one !,,,,,,,
,,,Let ’ s assume that I am going to make a presentation,,,,,,,
,,,and I 'd like to explain the three magic ingredient of a great presentation,,,,,,,
,,,and I ’ d like to make my audience want to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU59,7.35,7.43,So what doe my audience know before the presentation ?,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,Well they know that most presentation aren ’ t exactly successful,,,,,,,
,,,and they know TED is the exception that prof that rule .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU60,7.47,7.48,What do they believe ?,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,Probably like most people they believe presentation are for sharing information .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU61,7.53,7.53,It might be wrong but that doesn ’ t stop them believing it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU62,7.57,8.05,What do they feel about presentation ?,,,,,,,
,,,Probably bored but also resigned to a really ineffective way of presenting,,,,,,,
,,,because that ’ s just what everyone doe .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU63,8.08,8.15,And lastly what do they do ?,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,Well when it ’ s their turn to present,,,,,,,
,,,they generally will pack thing full of information,,,,,,,
,,,and they won ’ t personalize it to their audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU64,8.18,8.27,So what do I want them to do after my presentation ?,Aim,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,Well afterwards I ’ m going to want them,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,to aim to transform their audience every time they present,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,to change something in their audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU65,8.29,8.29,I ’ m going to need them to personalize their presentation every time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU66,8.34,8.38,And also I ’ d like them to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,because I know it will help them to succeed .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU67,8.42,8.45,What do they need to feel to do those thing ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well If they still feel bored or resigned they ’ re not going to do very much .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU68,8.49,8.55,So they need to feel curious about this new technique,,,,,,,
,,,they need to feel motivated to try it,,,,,,,
,,,and optimistic that it can work for them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU69,8.58,9.03,What do they need to believe to feel those thing ?,,,,,,,
,,,They ’ ll need to believe that the Roadmap,,,,,,,
,,,can actually help them to succeed in their presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU70,9.06,9.1,Lastly what do they need to know to believe feel and do those thing ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well they ’ ll need to know the three magic ingredient that ’ s pretty basic .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU71,9.14,9.17,They 'll need to know presentation are bad at information,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,but great at transformation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU72,9.19,9.19,And they ’ ll need to know how to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU73,9.24,9.24,OK now we ’ ve worked out where they were and where I want to take them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU74,9.29,9.29,What can I do now ? I fill in the Transformation Column .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU75,9.32,9.38,So what can I say or show or do to make those transformation ?,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,Now usually I ’ m using a flip and some sticky note here .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU76,9.43,9.43,So I ’ m going to use virtual sticky note .,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU77,9.45,9.45,Let ’ s start at the top .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU78,9.47,9.53,We need to make sure they know the three magic ingredient,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,so I ’ m going to need to talk at some point about the audience,,,,,,,
,,,about the speaker and the transformation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU79,9.56,9.59,They need to know presentation are bad at information,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,so maybe I should tell them that we forget most of what we hear very quickly .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU80,10.03,10.03,And perhaps I can find a visual way to show that a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU81,10.08,10.12,What next ? They need to know how to use the Roadmap so I ’ d better show it to them,,,,,,,
,,,and I guess I could make it even clearer by going through an example .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU82,10.16,10.17,They need to believe,,,,,,,
,,,that the Roadmap can help them to succeed in their presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU83,10.21,10.3,So I ’ ll need to show how easy it is,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,to take all of these sticky note off of the Transformation Column,,,,,,,
,,,and arrange them in a suitable order,,,,,,,
,,,to create the storyline for their presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU84,10.32,10.32,It really is a short .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU85,10.34,10.34,OK now I need to make them curious .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU86,10.36,10.4,Now to make them curious I ’ m going to need to make them care,,,,,,,
,,,and to make them care I need to show that I care .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU87,10.43,10.48,So I probably need to explain that most presentation really don ’ t succeed,,,,,,,
,,,and that I care about fixing that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU88,10.51,10.53,And then to make them care,,,,,,,
,,,I ’ m going to need to find out how relevant it is to them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU89,10.57,11.01,Perhaps I could ask them how many of them actually need to present,,,,,,,
,,,and of course I know the answer is pretty much everybody .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU90,11.04,11.04,I need to make them motivated and optimistic .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU91,11.06,11.1,Well I can make them optimistic by explaining how easy this is to use,,,,,,,
,,,but also how powerful it is .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU92,11.12,11.18,And to motivate them to try it,,,,,,,
,,,I ’ m going to need to explain that successful presentation,,,,,,,
,,,can really make a difference to how well they succeed in life .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU93,11.24,11.27,Lastly to make them do these thing I ’ ll need a call to action,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,which focus on what I want them to do afterwards .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU94,11.31,11.36,So there we have it !,,,,,,,
,,,That ’ s a very accelerated version of the brainstorming,,,,,,,
,,,but it doesn ’ t need to take long .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU95,11.38,11.42,What we have now is just enough relevant idea,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,on how we can transform our audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU96,11.45,11.5,So what happens next ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well this is where I ’ m going to take my magic wand out again,,,,,,,
,,,because this is where the presentation magic happens .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU97,11.52,12.09,This is where you can take all the sticky note off of the Transformation Column,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,prepare a suitably magical story line,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,and then arrange all of these idea back into that story line,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,and hey presto there is my presentation !,,,,,,,
,,,Now you might recognize this one because ...,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU98,12.12,12.12,this is the presentation you have been watching for the last ten minute .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU99,12.17,12.17,And this is where we are now .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU100,12.2,12.25,Isn ’ t that magic ?,,,,,,,
,,,So now you know what happens next !,,,,,,,
,,,Next I need to explain how simple this can be and how powerful .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU101,12.29,12.29,And it ’ s so simple that it doesn ’ t take an expert .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU102,12.32,12.39,Thousands of people have already used this technique,,,,,,,
,,,to prepare and deliver fantastic presentation of all kind,,,,,,,
,,,from TED talk to the boardroom .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU103,12.42,12.55,But more than presentation they ’ ve used it also for email,,,,,,,
,,,for proposal for preparing interview for preparing conference …,,,,,,,
,,,Basically it work in any situation,,,,,,,
,,,where you need to change what people believe feel and do .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU104,12.59,12.59,You really don ’ t need a magic wand .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
yoD8RMq2OkU105,13.02,13.02,This is all the magic you need .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,

yoD8RMq2OkU115,14.04,14.08,And most of all every time you get to present,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,

,,,,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
dEDcc0aCjaA13,1.1,1.15,One of the biggest mistake people make when they start their presentation is showing nervousness .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
dEDcc0aCjaA14,1.21,1.21,Here 's the key : It 's not whether you 're nervous it 's whether you show it .,Nervous,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
dEDcc0aCjaA15,1.25,1.25,The first thing you need to do is stand STILL .,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
dEDcc0aCjaA16,1.28,1.28,Do n't move .,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
dEDcc0aCjaA22,1.53,1.58,See the difference ?,,,,,,,
,,,Now we move on to step 2 which is Give Your Credentials .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
dEDcc0aCjaA23,2.03,2.08,This is where many presenter make the mistake of simply giving their title and year of,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,experience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
dEDcc0aCjaA24,2.09,2.13,They say something like I 'm a presentation skill coach and I 've been doing it for 20,,,,,,,

d812a7qG9Kw20,1.39,1.39,That 's the best way .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw21,1.4,1.41,Practice from an outline,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,and in the end present like an outline .,Outline,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Outline,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw22,1.43,1.53,One of the thing I will do in fact is,Sound,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,so I do n't sound like I 've memorized it,Sound,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,I do n't sound like a robot,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,is every time I practice,Purpose,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,I might say it a little differently on purpose,,,,,,,
,,,so that I 'm not tempted to memorize .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw23,1.55,1.55,So do n't try to put it word for word do n't try to memorize .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw24,1.59,1.59,Talking point only and practice from that kind of outline .,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw25,2.02,2.04,The number two tip on how to practice,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,is to spread out your practice session over time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw26,2.08,2.08,Do n't cram the night before .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw27,2.1,2.1,Do n't cram the morning before your presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw28,2.13,2.15,I recommend spreading your practice session out,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,over three day .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw29,2.16,2.2,The idea is to practice about three time each day,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,over those three day .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw30,2.21,2.25,I like to practice about 10 time,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,before I stand up and speak,,,,,,,
,,,and it 's really easier to do if you spread it out .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw31,2.28,2.3,A lot of great thing happen,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,when you spread out your practice session .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw32,2.32,2.32,The first thing that happens to me is it calm me down .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw33,2.35,2.35,It say to me hey there 's time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw34,2.37,2.41,So if my earliest few practice session practice time,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,do n't go so well I say hey there 's time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw35,2.43,2.43,No problem I got a few more day .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw36,2.44,2.44,I 'll work out these kink .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw37,2.46,2.49,Another great thing that happens is,,,,,,,
,,,let 's say I 've practiced it three time,,,,,,,
,,,and then I sleep on it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw38,2.51,2.59,Oftentimes in the middle of the day,Middle,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,I 'm doing other thing I 'm washing dish,,,,,,,
,,,my brain keep working on it,,,,,,,
,,,and keep figuring out better way to say something,,,,,,,
,,,or a quicker way to get to the point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw39,3.01,3.06,So in that downtime I believe that our brain,,,,,,,
,,,are still working on it,,,,,,,
,,,and we benefit from that downtime a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw40,3.08,3.12,The other great thing about breaking up,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,your practice session is it help me,,,,,,,
,,,with my composure in the moment .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw41,3.14,3.18,Because it feel to me like muscle memory with an athlete,,,,,,,
,,,that I 've done this before .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw42,3.2,3.2,I 've been doing this presentation for day .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw43,3.22,3.22,So it really help me stay composed and in the moment .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw44,3.25,3.28,So spread out those practice session three time a day,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,over three day .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw45,3.29,3.29,That usually is about what you need .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw46,3.31,3.36,The number three tip is to focus,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,on only one or two improvement,,,,,,,
,,,each time you practice it through .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw47,3.39,3.41,So you might just work on your structure and your outline,,,,,Structure,,
,,,in the first few time through that 's normal .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw48,3.44,3.48,The next few time through just pick one or two thing,Outline,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,like oh now I 'm just gon na work on looking up,,,,,,,
,,,form my outline eye contact for example .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw49,3.5,3.53,The next time through you might just work on gesture,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,and your posture a little bit .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw50,3.54,4.14,Every time you practice,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,add one or two thing you wan na improve on,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,because when you add too many thing all at once,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,when you try to get it perfect every time you practice,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,you 're going to get paralyzed,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,because you ca n't really improve more than one thing,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,or maybe two thing in any given practice session,,,,,,,
,,,so focus on improvement,,,,,,,
,,,and then start checking those off the list .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw51,4.16,4.18,And then your fundamental will all be in place,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,by the time you actually stand up to present .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw52,4.21,4.21,Number four tip is to keep practice session realistic .,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw53,4.26,4.29,Do not for example the whole time you 're practicing,,,,,,,
,,,isolate yourself completely and make condition perfect .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw54,4.34,4.37,Because what end up happening in the moment,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,of your actual presentation is it wo n't go perfectly .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw55,4.39,4.45,People will walk in late,Walk,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,or they 'll get up to use the bathroom,,,,,,,
,,,or there 'll be somebody,,,,,,,
,,,with a lawn mower outside your window .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw56,4.47,4.52,In fact I 've been recording this morning,,,,,,,
,,,and there is a neighbor working with a chainsaw nearby,,,,,,,
,,,that keep distracting me but you just power through it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw57,4.55,4.59,So after a few time practicing alone,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,what I end up doing when I practice,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,is I add distraction on purpose .,Distraction,Attention,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,Purpose,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw58,5.02,5.14,Like I will put the television or some music on,Music,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,and then I 'll talk over that,Distraction,Attention,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,because it creates a little bit of noise,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,and distraction for me to cope with,Distraction,Attention,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,and I know that if I can practice through those distraction,,,,,,,
,,,that during the actual moment I 'll be ready to push through .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw59,5.17,5.18,Even if something weird or odd happens,,,,,,,
,,,it wo n't throw me off a much .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw60,5.2,5.2,So keep practice session realistic .,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw61,5.23,5.28,And the number five tip is to visualize the first 30 second,,,,,,,
,,,and the last 30 second of your presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw62,5.3,5.3,So by visualization I mean the way a sport athlete doe it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw63,5.34,5.4,So you picture yourself walking up,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,through that first 30 second of the moment,Walking,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,starting off your presentation,Close,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and then the last 30 second how you 're gon na close .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw64,5.43,5.43,So athlete do this with great success .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw65,5.46,5.55,There is a study by Laure Ecard published in the 1980s,,,,,,,
,,,and a lot of other study like it,,,,,,,
,,,on basketball free throw shooting,,,,,,,
,,,and they found people that only visualized,,,,,,,
,,,actually did improve a little bit .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw66,5.57,6,People who practiced free throw basketball free throw,,,,,,,
,,,improved a little more .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw67,6.01,6.05,But athlete who did both,,,,,,,
,,,they visualized and they practiced,,,,,,,
,,,did the most improvement out of any of the group .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw68,6.08,6.15,So by visualizing the first 30 second and last 30 second,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,you 're going to be boosting,,,,,,,
,,,your overall performance up quite a bit,,,,,,,
,,,even if you do n't get to practice it a few extra session .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw69,6.18,6.2,So those are the five tip I recommend,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,in term of how to practice for a speech .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw70,6.22,6.28,These are the one I use personally,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,and I have coached a lot of people over the year,,,,,,,
,,,to use them and they really do work,,,,,,,
,,,so put them into practice a soon a possible .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
d812a7qG9Kw71,6.3,6.33,So I mentioned a couple of resource at the beginning,Beginning,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,I wanted to tell you about that are for you .,,,,,,,

,,,you want to make sure that you do n't unintentionally offend someone .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
XA1o5rvy8r447,3.47,3.47,And you do n't exclude anyone because they do n't understand what it mean .,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
XA1o5rvy8r455,4.26,4.4,Before I did n't even notice it so much because the slide wa so full,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,but when it started to get empty,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
XA1o5rvy8r459,4.48,4.5,And if you 're concerned about piracy,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
XA1o5rvy8r460,4.53,4.53,That 's what I do .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
XA1o5rvy8r461,4.54,4.54,Think about this slide you use for your internal meeting .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,

fzIxD1jXn4429,3.47,3.54,Ready ?,,,,,,,
,,,Let ’ s move on !,,,,,,,
,,,I ’ m sure that in your life you ’ ve heard good speaker and bad speaker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4430,3.59,3.59,Good speaker grab your attention and don ’ t let go .,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4431,4.02,4.02,You want to hear what they have to say .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4432,4.05,4.05,You feel interested and energised by listening to them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4433,4.09,4.09,Bad speaker are the opposite .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4434,4.11,4.11,Even if you try to make yourself listen you find that your attention drift away .,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4435,4.16,4.16,Your eyelid feel heavy and you have to struggle to stay awake .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4436,4.2,4.33,So here ’ s a question : what ’ s the difference between good speaker and bad speaker ?,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,And how can you make sure you speak effectively when you make your presentation in English ?,,,,,,,
,,,Here ’ s one way to think about it : bad speaker don ’ t think they have to earn your attention .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4437,4.41,4.48,Good speaker understand that no one ha to listen to them so they work hard to make,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,you want to pay attention .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4438,4.51,4.57,What doe this mean for you and your presentation ?,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,Getting people ’ s attention start from the beginning .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Beginning,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4439,5.01,5.07,You need to make it clear what people should expect from your presentation and why they,,,,,,,
,,,should care about what you have to say .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4440,5.11,5.16,Sounds like a nice idea but how do you do this ?,,,,,,,
,,,Here are three technique you can use .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4441,5.18,5.18,One : establish a problem which many people in your audience have .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4442,5.23,5.23,Then establish that you have a solution to their problem .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4443,5.28,5.41,For example :,,,,,,,
,,,Have you ever felt unfairly treated at work or felt that the work you do isn ’ t appreciated ?,,,,,,,
,,,We ’ ve been working to design new HR policy that will make sure all staff get fair recognition,,,,,,,
,,,for their contribution to the company .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4444,5.45,5.51,In this way you take a boring topic like HR policy and you make it more relevant,Topic,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,to your audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4445,5.53,5.54,How ?,,,,,,,
,,,By connecting it with their experience and feeling .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4446,5.58,6,The second technique ?,Statistic,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,Mention an interesting fact or a surprising statistic to get people ’ s attention .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4447,6.07,6.25,For example :,,,,,,,
,,,Did you know that the average office worker spends eight hour a day at work but only,,,,,,,
,,,doe four hour of productive useful work ?,,,,,,,
,,,I ’ m here to tell you about ‘ quality control ’ and how you can use this idea to make better,,,,,,,

fzIxD1jXn4450,6.39,6.41,For example :,,,,,,,

fzIxD1jXn4451,6.45,6.45,He spent several week building a relationship with a potential client .,,,,,,,

fzIxD1jXn4456,7.2,7.26,Here ’ s a question for you : which technique would you prefer to use and why ?,Topic,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,Okay now you ’ ve introduced your topic and you have everyone ’ s attention .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4457,7.31,7.45,What next ?,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,There ’ s a famous quote about making presentation :,,,,,,,
,,,“ Tell the audience what you ’ re going to say ; say it and then tell them what you ’ ve,,,,,,,
,,,said . ”,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4458,7.45,7.51,Have you heard this before ?,,,,,,,
,,,Do you know who said it ?,,,,,,,
,,,This come from Dale Carnegie a very successful American salesman and writer .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4459,7.58,7.58,He lived a long time ago but his advice is still relevant today .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4460,8.03,8.09,So here ’ s a question : what doe the quote mean ?,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,It mean that your presentation shouldn ’ t just give information .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4461,8.13,8.13,You also need to show people how your information is organized .,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4462,8.18,8.18,To do this you need signposting language .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4463,8.22,8.22,Let me give you an example to explain .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4464,8.25,8.25,Imagine you go to a website .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4465,8.27,8.27,The website is full of really useful interesting information .,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,

fzIxD1jXn4467,8.34,8.39,There ’ s no organization and you have to scroll up and down up and down this huge,Organization,,,,PresentationAttribute,,

,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4468,8.43,8.46,Would you stay on that website ?,,,,,,,

fzIxD1jXn4469,8.47,8.47,You ’ ll find a website which make it easier for you to find the information you need .,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4470,8.51,8.54,What ’ s the point here ?,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,The point is that having interesting or relevant information is not enough .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4471,9,9,How you structure and organize your information is equally important .,,,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4472,9.05,9.11,If you don ’ t structure your presentation clearly people won ’ t pay attention just,,,,,Structure,,

,,,,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4473,9.16,9.2,So how can you do this ?,,,,,,,
,,,You use signposting language .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4474,9.23,9.31,This mean using word and phrase to show the audience where your point begin and end,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,to show what ’ s coming next and to remind them about thing you talked about before .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4475,9.37,9.38,For example :,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4478,9.58,10.02,When you say something like this you aren ’ t giving people information about the topic,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,of your presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4479,10.03,10.03,Instead you ’ re showing people where you are and where you ’ re going next .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4480,10.08,10.08,It ’ s a kind of signpost .,SignPost,TransitionComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,

,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4486,11.21,11.21,So you ’ ve heard what I have to say .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4487,11.25,11.3,What conclusion can you take away from this ?,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,If you have an important presentation in English practice using signposting language .,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4489,11.49,11.49,Okay but thing don ’ t always go so smoothly in real life .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4490,11.56,11.58,We know that !,,,,,,,
,,,Let ’ s look at some advice and language for dealing with problem during your presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4491,12.07,12.07,Imagine you ’ re making your presentation in English .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4492,12.1,12.18,What could go wrong ?,,,,,,,
,,,What problem could you have ?,,,,,,,
,,,There are many common problem :,,,,,,,
,,,You might forget where you were or forget an important word .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4493,12.21,12.21,You might realise that you said something wrong or you didn ’ t explain something clearly .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4494,12.27,12.27,You might forget to mention something important .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4495,12.29,12.29,Or someone might ask you an awkward question which you have no idea how to answer .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4496,12.35,12.38,Of course there are other possibility !,,,,,,,
,,,Let ’ s think about these problem .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4497,12.4,12.54,What can you do and more importantly what can you say in these situation ?,,,,,,,
,,,First of all it ’ s a good idea to make a cue card with key point a well a any important,,,,,,,
,,,vocabulary you need .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4498,12.56,12.56,If you lose your place or you forget a word it could help .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn4499,13.01,13.01,However you can ’ t prepare for everything .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44100,13.05,13.05,So it ’ s useful to learn some phrase to deal with problem smoothly .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44101,13.12,13.28,If you lose your place and can ’ t remember what to say next you can use a filler phrase,MainPoint,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,like :,,,,,,,
,,,Where wa I ?,,,,,,,
,,,So what wa I saying ?,,,,,,,
,,,What ’ s the word in English again ?,,,,,,,
,,,If you still can ’ t remember look at your cue card with your main point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44102,13.35,13.35,Of course forgetting something isn ’ t ideal .,Forgetting,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44103,13.39,13.39,But if you do it ’ s better to keep talking rather than just standing there in silence .,Standing,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44104,13.47,13.55,What if you make a mistake or you realise that you didn ’ t explain something well ?,,,,,,,
,,,You could say :,,,,,,,
,,,Let me rephrase that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44105,13.57,14.2,Actually what I meant to say is…,,,,,,,
,,,To clarify I wanted to say that…,,,,,,,
,,,In this way you can correct yourself without admitting that you made a mistake !,,,,,,,
,,,What if you realise that you forgot to mention something important ?,,,,,,,
,,,Use a phrase like this :,,,,,,,
,,,Let me just add one more thing : …,,,,,,,
,,,I ’ d like to add something to a point we discussed earlier .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44106,14.26,14.26,Let me return to an earlier point briefly .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44107,14.29,14.36,Again this allows you to correct your mistake in a confident way so you look like you ’ re,Confident,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,in control .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44108,14.38,14.47,Finally what do you do if someone asks you a difficult question which you can ’ t answer ?,,,,,,,
,,,You have a few option .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44109,14.48,14.48,First you can delay giving an answer .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44110,14.52,14.58,For example :,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,I ’ ve allocated time for question at the end of this session so we ’ ll address your,,,,,,,
,,,idea later .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44111,14.59,15.04,Or : I ’ m not in a position to answer that right now but I ’ ll get back to you later,,,,,,,
,,,this week .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44112,15.06,15.18,This give you time to think of an answer and do some research if you have to !,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,Next you can deflect the question by asking a question back or maybe by asking other,,,,,,,
,,,audience member what they think .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44113,15.21,15.22,For example :,,,,,,,
,,,That ’ s an interesting question .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44114,15.25,15.3,Before I answer I ’ d like to know : what ’ s your take on this ?,,,,,,,
,,,Or : You ’ ve raised an important point there .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44115,15.34,15.37,What doe everyone else think about this ?,,,,,,,
,,,Finally if the question is irrelevant you can dismiss the question and move on .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44116,15.43,15.44,For example :,,,,,,,
,,,Thanks for your input but I don ’ t see how that ’ s connected to what I ’ m saying .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44117,15.49,15.49,I don ’ t mean to be blunt but I don ’ t think that ’ s relevant to today ’ s discussion .,Discussion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44118,15.56,16.02,Notice how you can use phrase like thanks for your input but… or I don ’ t mean to,,,,,,,
,,,be blunt but… to make your language more indirect and polite .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44119,16.08,16.16,So for dealing with difficult question just remember the three d ’ s : delay deflect,,,,,,,
,,,dismiss !,,,,,,,
,,,Finally we want to ask you something .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
fzIxD1jXn44120,16.19,16.28,Do you have any advice for giving good presentation in English or any language ?,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI5,0.35,0.37,"First of all, reference can help to",Reference,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,

,,,important to use evidence to make that a,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI7,0.45,0.49,is plagiarism. It s very easy to,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI8,0.49,0.51,accidentally plagiarize in your work. So,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI9,0.51,0.54,if you understand how to reference.,Reference,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI10,0.56,0.59,"correctly, you ll avoid plagiarizing the",,,,,,,
,,,last thing it s a source of future,,,,,,,

,,,reference in quoting and,Quotation,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,paraphrasing,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,a quotation is when you copy a piece of,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,text word from a book or,,,,,,,
,,,another type of source you should keep,,,,,,,
,,,these to an absolute minimum at,,,,,,,
,,,University we re looking to see that,,,,,,,
,,,you re paraphrasing rather than just,,,,,,,
,,,copying lengthy text from somebody,,,,,,,
,,,"else. S work, so a I just mentioned, do",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI14,1.4,1.48,not have them too long that will eat,,,,,,,
,,,into your word count and ultimately it,,,,,,,
,,,"will affect the mark that you ll get. So,",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI15,1.48,1.53,paraphrasing is what we re looking to,,,,,,,
,,,see that you re doing your assignment.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI16,1.54,1.56,"However, anything is when you look at",,,,,,,
,,,"other people, s work. and you put it into",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI17,1.56,1.58,your own word. It wa more to,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI18,1.58,2.06,paraphrasing than just changing one or,,,,,,,
,,,two word here and there or cutting out,,,,,,,
,,,word from a sentence. It will show your,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI19,2.06,2.18,"understanding to the reader, so, instead",,,,,,,
,,,of just identifying that something s,,,,,,,
,,,important and copying it word,,,,,,,
,,,You ve been able to read it understand,,,,,,,
,,,it and apply it to your work. So I m,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI20,2.18,2.35,"going to show you an example, of how to",Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,go from using a quote to paraphrasing it,,,,,,,
,,,So if We look at this quote here in,,,,,,,
,,,"academic writing, it s essential to state",,,,,,,
,,,the source of idea information. Such,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI21,2.35,2.39,reference allow reader to refer back,Reference,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,

,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI22,2.39,2.46,slide show you my First attempt of,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,paraphrasing the original is at the,,,,,,,
,,,bottom. My first attempt at the top,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI23,2.49,3,"Cottrell state that in writing, it s",Reference,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,important to state the source of idea,,,,,,,
,,,reference allow reader to find the,,,,,,,
,,,source themselves. Okay. What do you,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI24,3,3.11,think about my First attempt of,,,,,,,
,,,paraphrasing,,,,,,,
,,,you have nt quoted it properly it s not,,,,,,,
,,,a very good attempt. You re right. I,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI25,3.11,3.11,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI26,3.11,3.15,have nt done it properly I ve cut out,,,,,,,
,,,some word here and there I ve used some,,,,,,,
,,,synonym. I ve changed essential to,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI27,3.17,3.3,important it s not actually enough to do,,,,,,,
,,,this and call it paraphrasing at the top,,,,,,,
,,,you ll see my next attempt the original,,,,,,,
,,,at the bottom. and my First attempt is in,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI28,3.3,3.3,view. here contrl state that referencing,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI29,3.32,3.41,should always be used when using the,,,,,,,
,,,idea and opinion of others and,,,,,,,
,,,"academic writing, so that the original",,,,,,,
,,,source can be easily located. What do you,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI30,3.41,3.57,think of this attempt yeah that s much,Reference,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,better and you properly reference the,,,,,,,
,,,"page, a well okay? So this is a much",,,,,,,
,,,better attempt at paraphrasing I m not,,,,,,,
,,,"going to claim it perfect, but you can",,,,,,,
,,,see that I certainly have tried to put,,,,,,,
,,,it into my own word. and I ve still got,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI31,3.57,4.02,the same point across and I ve correctly,,,,,,,
,,,referenced the author.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI32,4.08,4.11,So once you paraphrase once you ve put,,,,,,,
,,,something into your own word. how do you,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI33,4.11,4.16,include that in your text well you need,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,to make sure you put the surname of the,,,,,,,
,,,author. or the organization and you need,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI34,4.17,4.21,to put the year of publication. So that,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI35,4.21,4.26,will look like this at the start of a,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,sentence. Cottrell 2001 stated that,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI36,4.28,4.28,plagiarism. is a confusing and difficult,Confusing,Coherence,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI37,4.32,4.34,concept to fully understand. So you can,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI38,4.34,4.37,see at the beginning of the sentence. the,Beginning,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI39,4.37,4.37,"author. s, surname go first and the date",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI41,4.41,4.41,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI42,4.41,4.44,a reference. at the beginning of the,Reference,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,

,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI46,4.5,4.5,author. also found that you can see here,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI47,4.52,5,I ve referred back to Cottrell and it s,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,obvious that I m continuing to talk,,,,,,,
,,,about this person at the end of a,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI50,5.1,5.14,of the sentence. It implies that you re,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI51,5.14,5.17,only talking about this last sentence.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI52,5.19,5.28,paragraph and it s come from Cottrell it,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,doe nt make that clear putting it at,,,,,,,
,,,the end of the sentence. implies you re,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI53,5.28,5.3,only talking about this very last,,,,,,,
,,,sentence. Okay. that s very important and,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI54,5.31,5.46,that s how accidental plagiarism can,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI55,5.46,5.47,help you to do very well in your course.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
5utoLhjUuAI56,5.5,5.52,When you paraphrase you should write,,,,,,,

5utoLhjUuAI57,5.52,5.54,in your own word.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
x9E8yaFCX0Y23,1.51,1.56,When I wa interviewing in business school I went to this really high end consulting,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,company and they brought me into a hotel and I wa sitting there with the consultant .,,,,,,,

x9E8yaFCX0Y33,2.49,2.54,One of the best way is a story and youíre going to need to do this every 10 to 15 minute,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,

-FOCpMAww289,0.46,0.5,I 've helped them prepare their talk for prime time,,,,,,,
,,,and learned directly from them,,,,,,,
,,,their secret of what make for a great talk .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2810,0.53,0.57,And even though these speaker and their topic all seem,Topic,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,completely different,,,,,,,
,,,they actually do have one key common ingredient .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2811,1.01,1.1,And it 's this :,,,,,,,
,,,Your number one task a a speaker,,,,,,,
,,,is to transfer into your listener ' mind an extraordinary gift,,,,,,,
,,,a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2812,1.16,1.16,Let me show you what I mean .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2813,1.17,1.17,Here 's Haley .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2814,1.18,1.2,She is about to give a TED Talk,,,,,,,
,,,and frankly she 's terrified .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2815,1.22,1.4,Presenter : Haley Van Dyck !,,,,,,,
,,,Over the course of 18 minute,,,,,,,
,,,1200 people many of whom have never seen each other before,,,,,,,
,,,are finding that their brain are starting to sync with Haley 's brain,,,,,,,
,,,and with each other .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2816,1.41,1.41,They 're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain pattern .,Beginning,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2817,1.45,1.45,And I do n't just mean they 're feeling the same emotion .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2818,1.48,1.48,There 's something even more startling happening .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2819,1.5,1.5,Let 's take a look inside Haley 's brain for a moment .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2820,1.54,1.54,There are billion of interconnected neuron in an impossible tangle .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2821,1.58,2.03,But look here right here,,,,,,,
,,,a few million of them are linked to each other,,,,,,,
,,,in a way which represents a single idea .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2822,2.06,2.1,And incredibly this exact pattern is being recreated in real time,,,,,,,
,,,inside the mind of everyone listening .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2823,2.13,2.21,That 's right ; in just a few minute,Voice,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,a pattern involving million of neuron,,,,,,,
,,,is being teleported into 1200 mind,,,,,,,
,,,just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2824,2.24,2.31,But wait what is an idea anyway ?,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,Well you can think of it a a pattern of information,,,,,,,
,,,that help you understand and navigate the world .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2825,2.34,2.38,Ideas come in all shape and size,,,,,,,
,,,from the complex and analytical,,,,,,,
,,,to the simple and aesthetic .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2826,2.4,2.4,Here are just a few example shared from the TED stage .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2827,2.43,2.43,Sir Ken Robinson creativity is key to our kid ' future .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2828,2.47,2.53,Sir Ken Robinson : My contention is that creativity now,,,,,,,
,,,is a important in education a literacy,,,,,,,
,,,and we should treat it with the same status .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2829,2.56,2.56,Chris Anderson : Elora Hardy building from bamboo is beautiful .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2830,2.59,3.01,Elora Hardy : It is growing all around u,,,,,,,
,,,it 's strong it 's elegant it 's earthquake .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2831,3.05,3.05,CA : Chimamanda Adichie people are more than a single identity .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2832,3.09,3.17,Chimamanda Adichie : The single story creates stereotype,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,and the problem with stereotype is not that they are untrue,,,,,,,
,,,but that they are incomplete .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2833,3.19,3.21,CA : Your mind is teeming with idea,,,,,,,
,,,and not just randomly .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2834,3.23,3.23,They 're carefully linked together .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2835,3.25,3.28,Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure,,,,,Structure,,
,,,that is your personal worldview .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2836,3.3,3.3,It 's your brain 's operating system .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2837,3.32,3.32,It 's how you navigate the world .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2838,3.34,3.34,And it is built up out of million of individual idea .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2839,3.38,3.47,So for example if one little component of your worldview,,,,,,,
,,,is the idea that kitten are adorable,,,,,,,
,,,then when you see this,,,,,,,
,,,you 'll react like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2840,3.48,3.54,But if another component of your worldview,,,,,,,
,,,is the idea that leopard are dangerous,,,,,,,
,,,then when you see this,,,,,,,
,,,you 'll react a little bit differently .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2841,3.57,3.59,So it 's pretty obvious,,,,,,,
,,,why the idea that make up your worldview are crucial .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2842,4.03,4.06,You need them to be a reliable a possible a guide,Guide,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,to the scary but wonderful real world out there .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2843,4.09,4.09,Now different people 's worldviews can be dramatically different .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2844,4.14,4.35,For example,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,how doe your worldview react when you see this image :,,,,,,,
,,,Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you look at me ?,,,,,,,
,,,A woman of faith an expert maybe even a sister ?,,,,,,,
,,,Or oppressed brainwashed,,,,,,,
,,,a terrorist ?,,,,,,,
,,,CA : Whatever your answer,,,,,,,
,,,there are million of people out there who would react very differently .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2845,4.38,4.38,So that 's why idea really matter .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2846,4.4,4.46,If communicated properly they 're capable of changing forever,,,,,,,
,,,how someone think about the world,,,,,,,
,,,and shaping their action both now and well into the future .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2847,4.51,4.51,Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2848,4.55,5.04,So if you accept,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,that your number one task a a speaker is to build an idea,,,,,,,
,,,inside the mind of your audience,,,,,,,
,,,here are four guideline for how you should go about that task :,,,,,,,
,,,One limit your talk to just one major idea .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2849,5.09,5.17,Ideas are complex thing ;,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,you need to slash back your content so that you can focus,,,,,,,
,,,on the single idea you 're most passionate about,,,,,,,
,,,and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2850,5.2,5.2,You have to give context share example make it vivid .,Context,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2851,5.24,5.29,So pick one idea,,,,,,,
,,,and make it the through running through your entire talk,,,,,,,
,,,so that everything you say link back to it in some way .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2852,5.33,5.33,Two give your listener a reason to care .,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2853,5.37,5.41,Before you can start building thing inside the mind of your audience,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,you have to get their permission to welcome you in .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2854,5.44,5.46,And the main tool to achieve that ?,,,,,,,
,,,Curiosity .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2855,5.47,5.47,Stir your audience 's curiosity .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2856,5.49,5.52,Use intriguing provocative question,,,,,,,
,,,to identify why something doe n't make sense and need explaining .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2857,5.56,6,If you can reveal a disconnection in someone 's worldview,,,,,,,
,,,they 'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2858,6.04,6.06,And once you 've sparked that desire,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,it will be so much easier to start building your idea .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2859,6.1,6.13,Three build your idea piece by piece,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,out of concept that your audience already understands .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2860,6.17,6.23,You use the power of language,,,,,,,
,,,to weave together concept that already exist,,,,,,,
,,,in your listener ' mind,,,,,,,
,,,but not your language their language .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2861,6.25,6.25,You start where they are .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2862,6.27,6.3,The speaker often forget that many of the term and concept they live with,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,are completely unfamiliar to their audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2863,6.33,6.42,Now metaphor can play a crucial role in showing how the piece fit together,Metaphor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern,,,,,,,
,,,based on an idea that the listener already understands .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2864,6.46,6.54,For example when Jennifer Kahn,,,,,,,
,,,wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR,,,,,,,
,,,she said It 's a if for the first time,,,,,,,
,,,you had a word processor to edit DNA .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2865,6.57,6.57,CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily .,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2866,7.02,7.06,Now a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment,,,,,,,
,,,a it snap into place in our mind .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2867,7.08,7.12,It 's important therefore to test your talk on trusted friend,,,,,,,
,,,and find out which part they get confused by .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2868,7.15,7.17,Four here 's the final tip :,,,,,,,
,,,Make your idea worth sharing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2869,7.21,7.26,By that I mean ask yourself the question :,,,,,,,
,,,Who doe this idea benefit ?,,,,,,,
,,,And I need you to be honest with the answer .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2870,7.29,7.32,If the idea only serf you or your organization,Organization,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,then I 'm sorry to say it 's probably not worth sharing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2871,7.35,7.35,The audience will see right through you .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
-FOCpMAww2872,7.37,7.51,But if you believe that the idea ha the potential,,,,,,,
,,,to brighten up someone else 's day,,,,,,,
,,,or change someone else 's perspective for the better,,,,,,,
,,,or inspire someone to do something differently,,,,,,,
,,,then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk,,,,,,,
,,,one that can be a gift to them and to all of u .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs1,0,0.02,In this video I 'll share public speaking tip,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,for beginner .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs2,0.04,0.07,So if you 're just getting started,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,in your stand speaking experience,,,,,,,
,,,this video is for you .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs3,0.08,0.08,So let 's unpack the detail .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs4,0.15,0.17,Hello there and welcome to this channel,Communication,Interactivity,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,Communication Coach .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs5,0.18,0.25,If you 've never tuned in yet,Impact,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,this channel is here to help rising leader,,,,,,,
,,,increase your personal impact,,,,,,,
,,,so you can lead the people around you,,,,,,,
,,,with more excellence .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs6,0.27,0.29,And today we 're talking about communication skill,Communication,Interactivity,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,specifically .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs7,0.3,0.36,If you have n't had a lot of experience,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,doing stand speaking,,,,,,,
,,,I 'm going to give you some do and some don'ts,,,,,,,
,,,that 'll help move you in the right direction .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs8,0.38,0.45,And a we talk about these do and don'ts,Section,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,I want you to pick out which one you think,,,,,,,
,,,would help you the most and feel free at any point,,,,,,,
,,,to comment in that section below the video .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs9,0.48,0.52,So when I said do 's and don'ts,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,we 're actually going to start with the don'ts,,,,,,,
,,,and then give you the do version of it,,,,,,,
,,,so that 's the way we 'll organize it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs10,0.54,0.54,So the first pair go like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs11,0.56,0.56,Do n't ramble and get long .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs12,1,1.09,Anytime a speaker is disorganized,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,and weave all around,,,,,,,
,,,it 's very hard to follow what he or she,,,,,,,
,,,is talking about and instead what you want to do,,,,,,,
,,,is give a nice organized and concise message .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs13,1.13,1.24,That mean you have to take the time beforehand,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,when you 're preparing to create a nice introduction,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,body and conclusion,MainPoint,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,make sure you have clear main point,,,,,,,
,,,and there 's a transition statement,,,,,,,
,,,between each main point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs14,1.25,1.35,Your audience is really going to appreciate,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,an orderly presentation of your idea,,,,,,,
,,,and it 's much more likely that they 'll remember,,,,,,,
,,,what you said and really that 's the whole point,,,,,,,
,,,of speaking to them in the first place .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs15,1.37,1.4,The next do n't is do n't look with your eye,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,in the wrong place .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs16,1.42,1.48,You want to not look over people 's head,,,,,,,
,,,or not look at the floor,,,,,,,
,,,and not stare at the ceiling,,,,,,,
,,,or scan around like that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs17,1.5,2,What you want to do is look directly,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,into a person 's eye long enough to finish a thought,Finish,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and then move on and look directly,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,into the next person 's eye,Finish,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,long enough to finish a thought .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs18,2.02,2.04,One public speaking teacher told me,,,,,,,
,,,one thought one look .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs19,2.06,2.08,In other word about a sentence or a half a sentence,,,,,,,
,,,and then move on to the next person .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs20,2.11,2.12,Now this is very difficult to do,,,,,,,
,,,if you 're not used to it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs21,2.13,2.18,It can feel very awkward looking right into someone 's eye,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,but you have to gear up for this,,,,,,,
,,,because that 's what audience want .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs22,2.2,2.2,We want people to connect with this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs23,2.22,2.26,If you 're not looking into our eye,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,and making u feel like we 're part of this,,,,,,,
,,,then you 're not going to have much of an impact .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs24,2.29,2.36,The next thing you want to do is do n't,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,rather this is a do n't,,,,,,,
,,,do n't clutter up all your note,,,,,,,
,,,with too many detail .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs25,2.38,2.4,A lot of time we 're tempted to jam our note,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,or our powerpoints with everything we want to say .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs26,2.43,2.53,But the result is when we 're nervous in the moment,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,we end up just locked in to our note,Nervous,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,and looking down the whole time and reading,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and sounding really stiff really wooden,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and you 're not going to again connect with people .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs27,2.55,3.02,So what you want to do instead,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,is pare down your note,,,,,,,
,,,so that you can just have a conversational style,,,,,,,
,,,with your audience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs28,3.03,3.11,And again a you 're practicing,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,you have to whittle down those note,,,,,,,
,,,so that all you have is like talking point,,,,,,,
,,,like a little grocery list of item,,,,,,,
,,,that you 're going to talk about .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs29,3.12,3.21,And it almost force you or at least free you,,,,,,,
,,,to connect with people to look up,,,,,,,
,,,and to have a nice normal conversation with them,,,,,,,
,,,in your natural personality .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs30,3.24,3.28,The next do n't is you do n't want to load up your slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,with all complicated animation and text .,Animation,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs31,3.32,3.34,And one of the reason is you do n't want,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,to stare at it and read from it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs32,3.35,3.4,The other reason is that it 's very hard to follow,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,what 's going on if your slide,,,,,,,
,,,are jam with the detail .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs33,3.42,3.49,What you want to do instead is to make sure,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,your slide are nice and clear,,,,,,,
,,,and simple and help you make whatever point,,,,,,,
,,,you 're making in that particular moment .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs34,3.51,4.09,A rule of thumb that I like to use,Thumb,BodyLanguageSignal,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,is if you 're spending more than about two or three minute,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,on each PowerPoint slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,then you 're probably wasting your time,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and I do n't recommend using more than a couple of slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,for a presentation anyway if you 're a beginner,,,,,,,
,,,because people tend to over rely on the slide,,,,,,,
,,,and load up each single slide with way too much .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs35,4.12,4.12,The next do n't is do n't fidget .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs36,4.15,4.15,Do n't fidget with your hand .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs37,4.16,4.16,Do n't fidget with your foot .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs38,4.18,4.21,Do n't pace back and forth aimlessly,Pace,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,because you 're nervous .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs39,4.22,4.34,What you want to do instead is have nice confident posture,Confident,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,where you stand in one place for a little while,Posture,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,and then if you want to move with a purpose move,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,stand in another place for a while,Purpose,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,and then share another part of your message .,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs40,4.36,4.38,Move for the purpose stand still,Purpose,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,share some of your message .,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs41,4.39,4.4,Do n't just pace,Pace,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,have nice confident posture .,Confident,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Posture,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs42,4.42,4.42,Same thing with your hand .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs43,4.43,4.45,You want to use gesture,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,and emphasize your idea with your hand .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs44,4.48,4.53,You do n't want to fidget and put them in your pocket,,,,,,,
,,,or play with a pen or do anything else weird,,,,,,,
,,,or distracting like that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs45,4.54,4.59,That 's a big part of how you come across non,,,,,,,
,,,and I recommend to you when you 're practicing,,,,,,,
,,,you work on this a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs46,5.01,5.01,And the last do n't undo is how you use your voice .,Voice,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs47,5.04,5.07,What you do n't want to do is speak too softly,,,,,,,
,,,use a lot of filler like um and ah and so .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs48,5.11,5.16,What you want to do is have a confident voice,Confident,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,where you speak loud like to the back of the room,Voice,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,with a nice clear volume .,Volume,Tone,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs49,5.18,5.2,Aim for the back of the room because just think about it,Aim,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,you have to reach those people .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs50,5.22,5.28,The other thing you want to do is emphasize,Sound,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,your key word with the sound of your voice,Voice,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,and also pause after you share a key idea,Pause,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,or a key thought .,KeyIdea,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs51,5.3,5.3,Pause for a minute silently .,Pause,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs52,5.31,5.33,Do n't fill it up with an um or an oh,Pause,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,the pause is much more effective .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs53,5.35,5.37,So here are some do and don'ts,,,,,,,
,,,some tip for beginner .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs54,5.39,5.46,Again a I mentioned,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,where do you see yourself in here ?,,,,,,,

,,,in this list ?,,,,,,,
,,,I would love to hear your comment,,,,,,,
,,,in that section below .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
i5mYphUoOCs55,5.48,5.49,So thanks God bless,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,and I will see you in the next video .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM1,0,0.02,A lot of work go into creating,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,well PowerPoint slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM2,0.05,0.1,Unfortunately many of the million of slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,that are created every day,Engaging,Interactivity,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,are n't engaging the audience at all .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM3,0.12,0.12,In fact many are hard to read and understand .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM4,0.15,0.21,But there are a few really important,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and easy to implement tip that can really make a difference,,,,,,,
,,,in your slide design .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM5,0.23,0.23,Let 's check them out .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM6,0.3,0.32,Before we get started a brief thanks to Skillshare,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,for sponsoring today 's video .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM7,0.34,0.36,Skillshare is a learning platform,,,,,,,
,,,with lot of great class .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM8,0.38,0.4,I have a special link for you that give you two month,,,,,,,
,,,free premium access .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM9,0.42,0.45,You 're going to find it in the description of this video,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,and I 'll be chatting more about them towards the end .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM10,0.48,0.48,Now let 's get started with my slide design tip .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM11,0.52,0.52,Number one visualize your data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM12,0.55,0.55,Presenting number and data can be a challenge .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM13,0.58,0.58,For one it 's probably not the most exciting topic .,Topic,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM14,1.01,1.08,And second if you put a lot of data on your slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,the audience is going to be busy reading the slide,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,instead of paying attention to you .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM15,1.1,1.17,Here 's an example a slide like this,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,encourages the audience to read and try to make sense,,,,,,,
,,,of the data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM16,1.18,1.21,Their attention is going to be on the slide,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,not on what you 're saying .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM17,1.23,1.23,Instead you could present it like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM18,1.27,1.29,Already from the title of the slide,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,the audience can get the critical information .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM19,1.31,1.34,The supporting chart make it easier,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,to interpret the slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM20,1.36,1.42,The important thing here is that you guide the eye,Guide,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,to the most important topic and avoid distraction,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,on the slide .,Topic,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Distraction,Attention,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM21,1.43,1.43,Which brings me to my next tip .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM22,1.46,1.46,Number two use white space and do n't clutter .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM23,1.5,1.54,White or negative space refers to the empty space,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,in between your content on the slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM24,1.56,2,Sometimes we feel the urge to make use of,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,every little space available to u on the slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM25,2.03,2.07,We plaster it with information and visual element,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,but more is n't necessarily always better .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM26,2.11,2.16,If you throw too much on the screen,,,,,,,
,,,you get a cluttered page that 's unattractive,,,,,,,
,,,and difficult to read .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM27,2.17,2.2,People get frustrated when information bombard them,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,you 're going to lose their attention .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM28,2.22,2.22,So do n't do that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM29,2.24,2.31,White space is also important,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,because it creates separation between the object,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,on your slide and it focus the eye and the message,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,you want to get across .,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM30,2.33,2.33,It also make text easier to read .,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM31,2.37,2.37,And also for the viewer it 's calming letting them breathe .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM32,2.41,2.43,And do n't get me wrong,,,,,,,
,,,white space doe n't have to be white .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM33,2.45,2.48,White space can also be any solid color,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,or even a blurred background .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM34,2.51,2.54,It just mean that there is no other content,,,,,,,
,,,or design element .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM35,2.55,2.55,Apple is a master when it come to applying this concept .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM36,2.59,3.02,It creates the feeling of luxury,Product,Prop,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,and put the product in focus .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM37,3.05,3.12,So when designing PowerPoint slide,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,do n't create slide like this,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,which result in visual overload,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,the viewer eye will be all over the place .,Overload,Clarity,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM38,3.15,3.15,Instead remember a few key rule .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM39,3.18,3.18,Keep the slide background clean .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM40,3.2,3.24,Company logo and other corporate identity element,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,do n't have to be on every single slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM41,3.26,3.26,White space principle also apply to your text on the slide .,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM42,3.3,3.3,Use a font size that 's big enough with generous spacing .,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM43,3.34,3.37,If you ca n't fit all your text this way,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,it 's probably too much text .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM44,3.39,3.39,So it come down to le is more .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM45,3.43,3.43,Give the element on your slide some breathing room .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM46,3.46,3.5,This way the eye land straight on the main message,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,and the slide is going to have a greater impact .,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Impact,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM47,3.53,3.53,Number three apply instant design idea .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM48,3.57,4,Design idea is a new feature in Microsoft 365,,,,,,,
,,,that 's powered by Microsoft 's AI or intelligence service .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM49,4.05,4.11,You can find it on the Home tab,Product,Prop,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,which a we know is the prime real estate,,,,,,,
,,,in any Office product .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM50,4.13,4.17,So what doe it do ?,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,Let 's say we have this rather uninspiring slide,,,,,,,
,,,about some timeline .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM51,4.19,4.19,And we want to make it more visually appealing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM52,4.22,4.24,If you click on Design Ideas up here,,,,,,,
,,,it will make several suggestion .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM53,4.27,4.27,Like this one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM54,4.28,4.28,Or this one is nice too .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM55,4.3,4.32,And immediately by just clicking a button,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,you have a much improved version of the slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM56,4.36,4.41,Or if you work with image in your slide,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,design idea can convert these uncropped picture,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,into a neatly organized slide automatically for you .,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM57,4.45,4.45,Like this one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM58,4.47,4.47,It also doe n't seem to like bullet point that much .,BulletPoint,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM59,4.5,4.52,So if it see a slide like this,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,it will suggest a more visual version of the slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM60,4.56,5.03,You can exchange the icon or color a you like,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,but if the shape or color is a part of the slide background,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,you ca n't adjust it .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM61,5.05,5.1,If you have poor design skill like me,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,or if you 're just in a hurry,,,,,,,
,,,then design idea can definitely give you a good start .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM62,5.14,5.14,Number four use Scalable Vector Graphics .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM63,5.18,5.18,The next tip is about the image in your presentation .,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM64,5.22,5.27,When you use raster image like JPGs or PNGs in your slide,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,be careful when resizing them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM65,5.3,5.32,Take a look at this Excel logo here,,,,,,,
,,,it look fine in the current size .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM66,5.34,5.37,I can scale it down without problem,,,,,,,
,,,but when I scale it up it 's going to become pixelated .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM67,5.41,5.41,Scaling down is okay scaling up is not .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM68,5.45,5.45,Not if you have these image .,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM69,5.47,5.52,But if you use SVGs,,,,,,,
,,,which is short for Scalable Vector Graphics,,,,,,,
,,,you can scale up without pixelation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM70,5.55,6.02,SVGs can be resized from small to large,,,,,,,
,,,without losing quality because they consist of,,,,,,,
,,,mathematical line and fill instead of pixel .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM71,6.06,6.06,They are also much smaller in size .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM72,6.09,6.16,For example the icon option in the insert tab are SVGs,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,and recent version of PowerPoint,,,,,,,
,,,allows you to edit these graphic .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM73,6.18,6.26,You can use the eyedropper tool to change the fill,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,or you can even disassemble the SVG image by converting it,,,,,,,
,,,to an Office shape .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM74,6.27,6.3,This way you can change the fill of individual part,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,of the image .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM75,6.32,6.34,So whenever you can choose vector graphic,Graphic,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,over raster image .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM76,6.36,6.4,You can scale them up without loss of resolution,,,,,,,
,,,and they are smaller in size a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM77,6.43,6.43,Number five apply the rule of third .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM78,6.47,6.52,In photography and cinematography,,,,,,,
,,,there is a basic guideline about how a shot,,,,,,,
,,,should be composed .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM79,6.54,6.54,It 's called the rule of third .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM80,6.56,6.56,This also applies to PowerPoint slide .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM81,6.58,6.58,Let me show you how .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM82,7,7,Here we have a slide with an image and some text .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM83,7.04,7.04,Let 's see how we can improve it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM84,7.06,7.09,The rule of third basically divide the canvas,,,,,,,
,,,into three horizontal row and three vertical column .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM85,7.13,7.13,The line intersect at these four point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM86,7.16,7.18,Guess what these are called ?,,,,,,,
,,,PowerPoints .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM87,7.2,7.27,What are the odds ?,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,The rule say that the key element of this slide,,,,,,,
,,,should be pleased to run these PowerPoints,,,,,,,
,,,or along the line .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM88,7.28,7.35,So let 's position the image like this with the head,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,on this PowerPoint and the text box,,,,,,,
,,,along the horizontal line like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM89,7.38,7.38,Let 's compare them side by side .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM90,7.4,7.44,What do you think ?,,,,,,,
,,,Most people will prefer to second version,,,,,,,
,,,it 's just more visually appealing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM91,7.46,7.49,An easy way to apply the rule of third in PowerPoint,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,is by using the guide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM92,7.51,7.51,Just go to the View tab and check the box next to guide .,Guide,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM93,7.56,7.59,You can add an additional horizontal and vertical guide,Guide,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,to create the grid .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM94,8.01,8.01,Give the rule of third a try and check it out for yourself .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM95,8.04,8.05,So these are my tip,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,when it come to PowerPoint slide design .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM96,8.08,8.08,I hope you found them helpful .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM97,8.1,8.22,If you 're interested in design in general,Graphic,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,and you 'd like to explore other area,,,,,,,
,,,such a logo design or brand identity,,,,,,,
,,,or just the core principle of visual design,,,,,,,
,,,check out the graphic design class on Skillshare .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM98,8.25,8.27,I personally enjoy the Graphic Design Basics course,Graphic,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,by Ellen Lupton .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
TQiln3CjtvM99,8.29,8.36,It 's short and concise and you get a good understanding,,,,,,,
,,,together with many example of the five basic,,,,,,,
,,,design principle .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,

Iwpi1Lm6dFo1,0.11,0.11,Okay lady and gentleman welcome .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo2,0.14,1.05,There is a question,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,which ha puzzled me for quite a while,,,,,,,
,,,and that is Why do our PowerPoints look the way they look ?,,,,,,,
,,,Or rather How on earth can we accept that they look the way they look ?,,,,,,,
,,,How can you do that ?,,,,,,,
,,,And do you know,,,,,,,
,,,what 's even more intellectually challenging for me to understand ?,,,,,,,
,,,It 's How can a person sit over here in this meeting room with 10 others,,,,,,,
,,,observing this dismally bad PowerPoint,,,,,,,
,,,filled with chart graphical element page number,,,,,,,
,,,fading away five seven minute thinking of other thing ?,,,,,,,
,,,You know the feeling the boredom the waste of time ?,,,,,,,
,,,This person after 40 minute,,,,,,,
,,,he or she will stand up a bit dazed,,,,,,,
,,,trotting off to his own office coming to his own computer,,,,,,,
,,,flipping it up going like 'Oh my god I 've got a presentation tomorrow,,,,,,,
,,,and I do have a PowerPoint to build . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo3,1.05,1.2,Now what is the chance that this person will build an equally bad PowerPoint,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,a the one that he or she wa herself tortured by,,,,,,,
,,,in the other conference room ?,,,,,,,
,,,Is that a big chance ?,,,,,,,
,,,Yeah .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo4,1.21,1.25,Now what is that ?,,,,,,,
,,,Why do we do that ? Is that vengeance ?,,,,,,,
,,,Is that where you go like 'You did that to me .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo5,1.28,1.28,Phew ! I 'm going to do it to you . You got it coming bro ' ?,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo6,1.28,1.31,Is that the case ? I do n't think so .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo7,1.34,1.34,I do n't think that 's got to do with vengeance intelligence .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo8,1.38,1.38,I think it 's got to do with something else .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo9,1.4,1.43,Now my passion in life is the brain,Passion,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,and an even bigger passion that is presentation skill .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo10,1.46,1.46,And I love combining these two .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo11,1.49,2.03,And about four year ago,,,,,,,
,,,I got so so upset I blew my top,,,,,,,
,,,because the way that we do neural execution,,,,,,,
,,,all over our boardroom today is just,,,,,,,
,,,it 's not fair to our intelligence a being Homo sapiens .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo12,2.07,2.19,So I thought there 's got to be something we can do about this,,,,,,,
,,,so I searched the world I looked for seminar,,,,,,,
,,,I looked for training program I looked for book,,,,,,,
,,,that could solve this question for me,,,,,,,
,,,but there wa none to be found .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo13,2.21,2.25,So I thought 'Well I 'll just do a Franz Kafka said,,,,,,,
,,, If it is n't written write it yourself . '' ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo14,2.25,2.29,And four year later,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,I have the great honour to stand here in front of you .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo15,2.32,2.36,What am I talking about ?,,,,,,,
,,,What are the PowerPoints I 'm referring to ?,,,,,,,
,,,They can look like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo16,2.37,2.41,Now this is one of the top three university in the world,,,,,,,
,,,advising their student and their teacher on how to build great PowerPoints .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo17,2.48,2.54,I received this from a customer,,,,,,,
,,,and you 've got to be semi,,,,,,,
,,,in order to even have something like this in the company .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo18,2.58,2.58,I love this one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo19,3,3.03,This one wa awarded the prize of being the worst PowerPoint,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,delivered by a public CEO in 2010 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo20,3.06,3.08,It 's a nice prize to pick up is n't it ?,,,,,,,
,,,'Oh yes thank you . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo21,3.08,3.1,Well done mate .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo22,3.12,3.12,And then you 're like 'This is bad . Can it get worse ? ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo23,3.12,3.16,Yes it can .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo24,3.2,3.23,Now this is the UN in Afghanistan,,,,,,,
,,,the US military describing the situation in the area .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo25,3.28,3.28,And well there are no comment on that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo26,3.32,3.32,But then we get this one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo27,3.33,3.33,'My god David Phillips this ha got to be the thing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo28,3.37,3.37,This ha got limited amount of text .,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo29,3.39,3.39,It 's got a supporting image .,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo30,3.41,3.41,It 's got a clear headline .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo31,3.42,3.42,This is the truth . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo32,3.42,4.06,Well the thing is,,,,,,,
,,,if you recognise yourself in any of these,,,,,,,
,,,which I think you do nodding away,,,,,,,
,,,I want to make you aware of the following :,,,,,,,
,,,that if you 've delivered a presentation with something like that behind you,,,,,,,
,,,90 % of what you said,,,,,,,
,,,wa gone within 30 second .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo33,4.09,4.21,And then you go 'No no no way Jose,,,,,,,
,,,that is way I know it 's bad but it ca n't be that bad,,,,,,,
,,,can it now really ? ',,,,,,,
,,,Well just let me give you an example of really how bad your working memory is,,,,,,,
,,,and mine for that case .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo34,4.23,4.23,I want you to imagine this situation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo35,4.25,4.25,You 're at the train station waiting for the train .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo36,4.28,4.28,You can see it coming on the horizon .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo37,4.3,4.3,You 're fiddling away you finally find where you put your ticket .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo38,4.33,4.33,And you take it out and you go 'Car five seat 42 . Got it . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo39,4.33,4.33,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo40,4.33,4.42,Have you ?,,,,,,,
,,,You have absolutely no idea where you 're going to sit do you ?,,,,,,,
,,,So you 're like 'Is this only me or ... Well I 'll check . Five 42 . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo41,4.42,4.42,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo42,4.42,4.42,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo43,4.42,4.46,You put it down again .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo44,4.47,4.48,Have you got it ?,,,,,,,
,,,No you have n't got it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo45,4.49,4.49,You 'll do this on an average of six time before you sit down .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo46,4.53,4.56,I 've seen people in the train go,,,,,,,
,,,'Five 42 five 42 . Yes this is my seat check . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo47,4.56,4.56,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo48,4.56,5.07,Now the bad news in the situation is this :,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,you do not have a separate working memory for PowerPoint,,,,,,,
,,,and a separate working memory for train ticket .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo49,5.1,5.1,It 's the same dismally bad working memory for both activity .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo50,5.17,5.27,So I might be harsh when I say this,,,,,,,
,,,but there is one man on this earth,,,,,,,
,,,who know more about the brain than anybody else,,,,,,,
,,,one of the most leading neurologist called John Medina,,,,,,,
,,,and he put it like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo51,5.29,5.33,[ If company would have a little respect for business,,,,,,,
,,,a they have for presentation,,,,,,,
,,,the majority would go bankrupt . ],,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo52,5.33,5.35,And it 's with his word that I welcome you to 'How to Avoid Death by PowerPoint ' .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo53,5.42,5.49,Now my objective for this evening for these 18 minute,Objective,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,is to give you five design principle,,,,,,,
,,,that will cognitively and psychologically optimise your PowerPoint slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo54,5.54,5.59,And if you have n't used them before,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,they will make a tremendous difference,,,,,,,
,,,to every PowerPoint you 'll be delivering from this day and on .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo55,6.05,6.05,So let 's start .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo56,6.06,6.06,The first one of these five is one message .,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo57,6.08,6.13,I received this from a customer,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and I said 'Hey we 've got a lot of issue in here,,,,,,,
,,,but let 's start with the first one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo58,6.15,6.15,You 've got two message .,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo59,6.16,6.16,Let 's move one of them out of the way and just bring one message per slide . ',Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo60,6.16,6.24,So why should we only have one message per slide ?,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,Well I 'll give you this beautiful example .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo61,6.26,6.31,You 're at this nice party you 've got the music going boom,Music,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,you 've got this person you 're chatting away to,,,,,,,
,,,you 're having a good time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo62,6.34,6.34,And then you hear your name ; you hear your name spoken somewhere .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo63,6.37,6.46,Your entire attention is now diverted in that direction,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,and with this person you 're just nodding away,,,,,,,
,,,hoping that you 're nodding in the right instance yeah ?,,,,,,,
,,,Yes yes yes .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo64,6.47,6.49,After a minute this one stop talking about you,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,so you divert your attention straight again .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo65,6.51,6.57,Now that person will then say 'Well do n't you agree ? ',,,,,,,
,,,And do n't we just love that situation ?,,,,,,,
,,,We have got no clue what they 've been talking about .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo66,7,7,The same thing go for PowerPoint .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo67,7.01,7.07,If you 've got more than one message,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,the chance is big they will be focusing on this one and not that one,,,,,,,
,,,or that one and not this one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo68,7.09,7.09,Just make it simple for human being .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo69,7.11,7.11,Have one message per slide .,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo70,7.12,7.12,We are extremely limited to understanding more .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo71,7.17,7.17,Let 's move on . Go to working memory .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo72,7.17,7.17,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo73,7.19,7.23,I 've already given you this bad vibe that your working memory is bad,,,,,,,
,,,and I 'm afraid I 'm not coming with better news .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo74,7.27,7.27,I 'm coming with worse news and it go like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo75,7.3,7.39,This equation ha the basis of John Sweller and Mayer,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,and they come to the conclusion,,,,,,,
,,,that there is something in our brain called 'the redundancy effect ',,,,,,,
,,,and it work like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo76,7.41,7.54,If you have text sentence on your PowerPoint,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and you persist with the annoying idea of speaking at the same time,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,what will be remembered by the audience,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,is zero .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo77,7.57,7.57,Or very close to zero .,Close,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo78,7.59,8.03,Now why is that ? How doe that come about ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well it ca n't look like this . It 's just not practical .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo79,8.03,8.03,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo80,8.07,8.07,You ca n't stand and have this and talk at the same time .,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo81,8.09,8.11,So what are you supposed to do ?,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,Well use PowerPoint for what it 's supposed to be used for .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo82,8.15,8.21,Pick it like this pull down your text into the documentation field,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and use the area up there for the presentation material :,Material,Prop,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,short sweet bit of text and an image .,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo83,8.24,8.24,That is what enhances your image .,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo84,8.26,8.26,That is what enhances your message .,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo85,8.28,8.28,So use PowerPoint a it 's supposed to be used .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo86,8.33,8.35,Come to the third of these five principle,,,,,,,
,,,and that 's size .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo87,8.37,8.38,Before I go into that,,,,,,,
,,,I want to make you aware the following .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo88,8.42,8.53,Every time you open your eye for the rest of your life,Open,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,you will focus on four thing :,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,moving object signalling colour like red orange and yellow,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,contrast object and big object for the rest of your life .,Colour,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo89,8.58,8.58,Give you a practical example of that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo90,9,9,Imagine yourself being home with a friend a really good friend .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo91,9.03,9.03,Now the television is on but the sound is off .,Sound,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo92,9.07,9.12,You 're having a great conversation,,,,,,,
,,,but do you find it easy to not look at the television ?,,,,,,,
,,,No . Why not ?,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo93,9.12,9.18,Because it 's got moving object,Colour,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,it 's got signalling colour it 's high in contrast,,,,,,,
,,,and they 're usually very big these time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo94,9.22,9.3,So why not use this to our benefit ?,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,If you look at this where is your attention drawn to,,,,,,,
,,,without you even having a chance of controlling it ?,,,,,,,
,,,It 's going to the big three all the time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo95,9.33,9.33,Have a look at the practical situation ; have a look at this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo96,9.36,9.37,Where are your eye drawn to ?,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,I can see that they 're drawn constantly to the headline .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo97,9.41,9.45,Now how often is the headline the most important part in a PowerPoint ?,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,It 's very rare .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo98,9.48,9.56,Even so every PowerPoint template is built like this,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,where the headline is the biggest object and the content is the smallest,,,,,,,
,,,going absolute opposite to our biological reaction .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo99,10,10.03,So what doe this look like if we just show you an example ?,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,Well now I 've reduced the title and it look like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo100,10.06,10.13,Do you see how your eye now fall down into the content ?,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,Now they 're sucked into the headline,,,,,,,
,,,and now they 're falling down into the content .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo101,10.15,10.31,So I can control exactly where you are,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,but why do people build PowerPoints,,,,,,,
,,,where people will be spending 70 % of the time on the headline,,,,,,,
,,,when it 's not the most important part ?,,,,,,,
,,,So what I want you to take with you from this,,,,,,,
,,,is the most important part of your PowerPoint,,,,,,,
,,,should also be the biggest nothing else .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo102,10.35,10.35,Moving on to number four contrast .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo103,10.41,10.41,Contrast control your focus .,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo104,10.44,10.49,So what doe that look like ?,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,For instance if I show you a list like this,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,your eye are over the place,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,because you do n't really know what to focus on .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo105,10.51,10.51,So I 'll use a built functionality into PowerPoint which go like this .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo106,10.55,10.59,I 'll show you the first subject I 'll take it away with contrast,,,,,,,
,,,and I 'll show you the second one,,,,,,,
,,,and I 'll do it again and again and again and again .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo107,11.03,11.03,You 're now following exactly the white spot .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo108,11.05,11.13,If I do this dun,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,I can see your eye just wobbling around,,,,,,,
,,,and you 're a bit like a kitten going after a little laser pointer on the wall,,,,,,,
,,,going like 'Where is it ? I 've got it . I 've got it . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo109,11.13,11.13,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo110,11.13,11.16,Because you 're following where the white spot is and not the rest .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo111,11.2,11.2,Now this is a beautiful example .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo112,11.21,11.21,Please do use this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo113,11.23,11.27,Use it because you can show amazing big table like this,,,,,,,
,,,if you use the effect of contrast the principle of contrast .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo114,11.29,11.29,Look what this look like .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo115,11.31,11.36,Your eye are all over the place ; you do n't know what to focus on,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,but I just apply the principle of contrast,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,and it look like that and suddenly you know exactly what to focus on .,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo116,11.4,11.41,Here they 're all over the place,,,,,,,
,,,and here they 're exactly where I want them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo117,11.45,11.53,Now there 's a big major drawback with PowerPoints,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,and that is that the majority of company on this earth today,,,,,,,
,,,they persist in having white background in PowerPoint .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo118,11.57,11.57,Look at that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo119,11.58,11.58,Oh it 's bright it 's shiny .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo120,12,12.04,Could you tell me who ha the highest contrast me or the screen ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well the screen .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo121,12.06,12.08,Who 's usually the biggest me or the screen ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well the screen .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo122,12.09,12.23,So the only option I have is dress myself up in signalling colour,Dress,SpeakerAppearance,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,and jump around on stage in order to balance that problem out,Colour,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,and that is obviously not a good corporate strategy,Strategy,,,,Structure,,
,,,in the long term would it be ?,Strategy,,,,Structure,,
,,,I think the long strategy is to just switch it around .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo123,12.26,12.26,PowerPoint is not supposed to have white background .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo124,12.29,12.29,If I do this your eye relax .,Eye,EyeMotion,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo125,12.31,12.31,You focus on me .,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo126,12.32,12.32,I 'm the biggest object .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo127,12.33,12.33,I 'm the most contrast object .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo128,12.37,12.37,I got your focus .,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo129,12.38,12.45,Why is that important ?,,,,,,,
,,,It 's important because I am I always have been,,,,,,,
,,,and I always will be the presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo130,12.48,12.48,That is my visual aid .,,,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo131,12.56,12.56,Moving into the last principle and that is object .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo132,13.03,13.06,Now this is one of the most severe principle,,,,,,,
,,,and it go like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo133,13.07,13.1,How many object do I have here ?,,,,,,,
,,,If you count them quickly you 'll see that I 've got 16 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo134,13.12,13.2,Do you see this little beauty at the end a well,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,which go 'page 12 of 95 ' ?,,,,,,,
,,,What is that ?,,,,,,,
,,,Why do we do that ?,,,,,,,
,,,That only creates anxiety .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo135,13.22,13.22,If anything you are 'Oh my god I ca n't take 83 more of those . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo136,13.22,13.31,But it can also create hope,,,,,,,
,,,because imagine ...,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo137,13.33,13.33,imagine when it 's 90 out of 95 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo138,13.36,13.36,'Oh I can see the light ; I can see the end of the tunnel . ',End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo139,13.36,13.42,Kidding aside do n't do that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo140,13.45,13.54,Now there are so many idea out there,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,on how many object you 're supposed to have in PowerPoint,,,,,,,
,,,and once and for all I just want to put my foot down,,,,,,,
,,,and state to you that this is the perfect amount .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo141,13.57,13.57,In order to do that I want you to just feel it yourself .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo142,14,14.02,How many object are you supposed to have ?,,,,,,,
,,,And we 're going to do that by showing you a couple of ball .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo143,14.06,14.06,I 'll throw up the ball .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo144,14.07,14.07,I want you to nod to me when you 've counted them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo145,14.09,14.09,Simple instruction . You with me ?,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo146,14.09,14.12,Cool here we go .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo147,14.16,14.16,Alright take you about two second .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo148,14.19,14.19,Good . Well done .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo149,14.19,14.19,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo150,14.21,14.21,Your next set of ball .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo151,14.22,14.22,Count them and nod to me when you 've counted them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo152,14.25,14.25,Here we go .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo153,14.27,14.27,Excellent . Yeah .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo154,14.27,14.27,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo155,14.28,14.3,That took you about 1.2 second if you 're normal,,,,,,,
,,,which about 90 % of you seem to be .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo156,14.34,14.34,We 'll have the third set of ball the last one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo157,14.37,14.37,Look at this nod to me when you 've counted them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo158,14.4,14.43,Oh what wa that ?,,,,,,,
,,,I just pressed the button and you nodded simultaneously .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo159,14.47,14.51,That will if you are normal take you 0.2 second,,,,,,,
,,,two of a second .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo160,14.53,14.53,This will take you 1.2 this will take you two of a second .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo161,14.57,15,And for anyone of you who you 're good at math,,,,,,,
,,,you 'll find out that that number is approximately 500 % difference .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo162,15.05,15.07,How is that even remotely possible ?,,,,,,,
,,,There are only two object in difference .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo163,15.11,15.15,Well might I suggest the following :,,,,,,,
,,,this one you have to count,,,,,,,
,,,and this one you see .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo164,15.17,15.3,Could that be correct ?,,,,,,,
,,,So what you 've just experienced is the following :,,,,,,,
,,,that the cognitive process of counting,,,,,,,
,,,take 500 % longer time requires 500 % more energy resource,,,,,,,
,,,to execute than just seeing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo165,15.36,15.51,So what I want you to keep in mind at all time,,,,,,,
,,,what I want you to keep in your head is this :,,,,,,,
,,,which is the Swedish number for this :,,,,,,,
,,,[ Six ],,,,,,,
,,,The magical number is six .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo166,15.53,15.53,It 's not five it 's not seven it 's six .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo167,15.57,15.57,And I want to make you aware of this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo168,15.59,16.13,When you go into a presentation in the future,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,and you 've built this amazing PowerPoint,,,,,,,
,,,if you 've got more than seven object or seven or more object,,,,,,,
,,,you have to be aware that all the people in there,,,,,,,
,,,they have to use 500 % more energy and cognitive resource,,,,,,,
,,,to understand what 's in your PowerPoint .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo169,16.16,16.28,Now how do you think,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,their energy brain by nature behaves ?,,,,,,,
,,,Will it go like 'Ooh I 'll easily invest 500 % more cognitive resource,,,,,,,
,,,to understand this weird slide ',,,,,,,
,,,or ' I wo n't ' ?,,,,,,,
,,,' I wo n't . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo170,16.28,16.29,And you 've just incurred death by PowerPoint .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo171,16.33,16.36,Now what doe this look like in real life ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well have a look at this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo172,16.37,16.4,Sixteen object can we agree that that 's too many ?,,,,,,,
,,,Yes we can .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo173,16.42,16.44,So what doe it look like if we reduce it ?,,,,,,,
,,,Look at this . We go from this to this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo174,16.44,16.44,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo175,16.48,16.48,And this is where your brain go 'Ahh ' .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo176,16.52,16.52,And this is where your brain go 'Ugh ' .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo177,16.55,16.55,Ahh .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo178,17.01,17.14,And I assume that in the future,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,when you deliver PowerPoints to your colleague to your fellow people,,,,,,,
,,,you want them to go 'Ahh ',,,,,,,
,,,when you show them your slide .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo179,17.16,17.16,You do n't want them to go 'Ugh ' .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo180,17.23,17.35,Now there is have you seen this movie,,,,,,,
,,,'The Rain Man ' by Dustin Hoffman ?,,,,,,,
,,,Seen that ?,,,,,,,
,,,It 's a beauty is n't it ?,,,,,,,
,,,He come into this cafeteria and somebody drop toothpick,,,,,,,
,,,and he go like 'Boom 247 . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo181,17.35,17.4,It 's amazing is n't it ?,,,,,,,
,,,His perceptive limit is here .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo182,17.43,17.47,Your perceptive limit,,,,,,,
,,,is here .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo183,17.5,18.06,Now what amazes me,,,,,,,
,,,is that whichever country I go to whichever company I see,,,,,,,
,,,it seems like they build PowerPoints,,,,,,,
,,,in the hope that all their fellow colleague are autistic or savant,,,,,,,
,,,which obviously is not the case .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo184,18.11,18.11,So but then you go like this 'But David my god .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo185,18.16,18.16,This mean that I have to have more slide . ',Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo186,18.16,18.23,'Yes that is entirely correct .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo187,18.26,18.26,You have understood me clearly . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo188,18.26,18.33,I want to make one thing clear here,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and that is that the amount of slide in your PowerPoint,,,,,,,
,,,ha never been the problem .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo189,18.38,18.38,It is the amount of object per slide which ha been the problem .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo190,18.45,18.53,The stupid idea,Organisation,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,that corporate organisation all over the world,,,,,,,
,,,they 've come up with limitation going like,,,,,,,
,,,'Ooh we 've got this clever idea :,,,,,,,
,,,You ca n't use 40 slide . You can only use four . ',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo191,18.53,18.53,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo192,18.53,19.01,So what do people do ?,,,,,,,
,,,Well they take the content of the rest 36,,,,,,,
,,,and they jam it in the first four .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo193,19.03,19.07,My god is that counterproductive or what ?,,,,,,,
,,,And we call ourselves intelligent .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo194,19.11,19.11,No no .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo195,19.12,19.14,Alright so compared,,,,,,,
,,,I started off with 95 of those .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo196,19.19,19.19,We ended up with 135 of these .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo197,19.23,19.26,And yes it gave an immediate result,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,to the application that we were working for .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo198,19.3,19.3,So to summarise this .,Summarise,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo199,19.33,19.35,Let 's have some fun and do a cross,Fun,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,because obviously I have to prove my point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo200,19.37,19.41,Do you remember more than 90 % of what I said ?,,,,,,,
,,,I 'm not going to be that harsh .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo201,19.42,19.42,Let 's do a crossword instead .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo202,19.45,19.45,It 's going to go like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo203,19.46,19.46,Words are going to come up .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo204,19.48,19.48,I 'm going to ask you to scream them out a loud a you can a we go along .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo205,19.51,19.55,How many message are you supposed to have per slide ?,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,One . Very good .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo206,19.55,19.55,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo207,19.58,19.58,I think you were looking for a different word there .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo208,20.03,20.05,What can we use to steer our focus ?,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,( Audience ) Contrast .,,,,,,,

,,,( Audience ) Sentences .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo212,20.13,20.13,Beautiful .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo213,20.14,20.16,And what kind of background should we have ?,,,,,,,
,,,We should have dark .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo214,20.18,20.18,And finally now you can say it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,

,,,literally every single presentation that they use .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg21,2.17,2.25,Little element that typically appear on slide that,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,almost every consultant use every day,,,,,,,
,,,but that I rarely see on presentation outside of the,,,,,,,
,,,consulting world .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg22,2.26,2.31,So if you 're interested to learn lot of little tip,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and trick that you can use for your,,,,,,,
,,,slide presentation a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg23,2.32,2.32,Look at this video until the end .,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg24,2.34,2.46,And if you 're one of those people that are,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,really interested to take your slide presentation,,,,,,,
,,,game to the next level,,,,,,,
,,,I even released a multi course and all the,,,,,,,
,,,tip and trick that I learned at McKinsey on how you make,,,,,,,
,,,top management style presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg25,2.48,2.51,There are already over 10000 student,,,,,,,
,,,taking the course .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg26,2.52,2.55,If you 're interested in that,,,,,,,
,,,I leave a link to the course in the,,,,,,,
,,,description down below .,,,,,,,

PgOD1j2DhNg27,2.56,3,So if you 'd like to learn more about that,,,,,,,
,,,and also read lot of student review,,,,,,,
,,,feel free to have a look and check out the course .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg28,3.02,3.02,But now let 's dive into that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg29,3.04,3.06,I prepared a bunch of slide for you that just,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,illustrate my point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg30,3.08,3.1,Let 's now switch to my computer to have a look,Computer,VisualAidDevice,,,VisualAid,,
,,,how this look like .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg31,3.11,3.11,Alright let 's jump into it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg32,3.13,3.13,So let 's start with some basic .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg33,3.15,3.17,Some basic element that should be included,,,,,,,
,,,on every single page .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg34,3.18,3.18,So let 's start here on the bottom .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg35,3.2,3.2,What you see here is the date .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg36,3.21,3.21,The current date .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg37,3.22,3.27,And pretty frequently you put here the date,,,,,,,
,,,either when the presentation happened,,,,,,,
,,,where you present your page,,,,,,,
,,,or when you created a document .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg38,3.29,3.41,Because what you will also find is that many document,Context,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,in professional context,,,,,,,
,,,many presentation many slide,,,,,,,
,,,are not actually created for actual presentation,,,,,,,
,,,but rather a a document that is then circulated,,,,,,,
,,,sent around in a company .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg39,3.42,3.47,And a date is just important,,,,,,,
,,,because when in retrospect,,,,,,,
,,,you 're able to actually know,,,,,,,
,,,to understand when the document wa created .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg40,3.49,3.49,Which of course is important in many way .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg41,3.51,3.56,The second thing that you 'll include on,,,,,,,
,,,pretty much every page,,,,,,,
,,,is a page number .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg42,3.57,4.02,This of course is very useful if you sit,,,,,,,
,,,in a meeting and just a colleague want,,,,,,,
,,,to refer to a specific page .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg43,4.03,4.1,Then to be able to say okay,,,,,,,
,,,this is a page 18 and then everybody know,,,,,,,
,,,what page 18 exactly is,,,,,,,
,,,because there is a page number included on the document .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg44,4.13,4.13,Then of course is very important .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg45,4.15,4.15,Next thing you should look at is the source .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg46,4.17,4.19,So here you can include a source,,,,,,,
,,,such a Firm Learning .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg47,4.21,4.27,Of course you can even then include just your name,,,,,,,
,,,or your department a a source,,,,,,,
,,,but even better would be especially if you refer to a,,,,,,,
,,,specific data then also give the source of the data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg48,4.31,4.39,So what date are you using ?,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,Where is the data coming from ?,,,,,,,
,,,When wa the date collected ?,,,,,,,
,,,Some specific information on what data you 're using,,,,,,,
,,,is what you can likely include here in the source .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg49,4.41,4.41,The next element that you can use are footnote .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg50,4.43,4.46,So footnote one two three this is just a part where,,,,,,,
,,,you can give specific detail on certain thing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg51,4.48,4.51,But maybe just not fit in the,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,regular text on your page .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg52,4.53,4.58,Then you would just include it in the footnote,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,to give you some extra space,,,,,,,
,,,because it 's often a smaller font size,,,,,,,
,,,than the main page .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg53,5,5,Just to show additional remark .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg54,5.01,5.04,And of course,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,one of the most important element,,,,,,,
,,,of every page is the action title .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg55,5.06,5.06,The action title is the title of the page .,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg56,5.09,5.09,And creating a good action title is an art form itself .,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg57,5.14,5.2,Now I will not go into much of detail,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,in this video what a good action title look like,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,because I already created a specific video,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,only focusing on action title .,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg58,5.22,5.25,The video even includes an exercise how you can,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,improve your action title creation skill .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg59,5.28,5.29,If you 're interested in that,,,,,,,
,,,have a look .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg60,5.31,5.34,I will include a link to the video above,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,so that you can directly look into it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg61,5.35,5.35,So far so good .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg62,5.36,5.39,So this wa some just really bare basic,,,,,,,
,,,that should be included in every page .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg63,5.4,5.4,Let 's jump into something else .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg64,5.41,5.41,And this is the creation of chart .,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg65,5.44,5.49,So what you will see in consulting,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,is that almost every slide that you use,,,,,,,
,,,contains a chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg66,5.5,5.5,So some kind of diagram where you depict data .,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg67,5.53,5.55,The reason is that in consulting,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,very frequently your argumentation will be based on data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg68,5.59,6.02,You can just expect from you,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,that you will back up your finding,,,,,,,
,,,and your recommendation with some date analysis .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg69,6.05,6.1,And if you do these kind of data analysis,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,of course you will frequently use chart to then,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,show the result of your analysis .,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg70,6.12,6.14,And these are just the chart that you can create,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,with the think expansion .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg71,6.16,6.19,If you do not know think,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,it 's a plugin that very frequently is used,,,,,,,
,,,by consulting firm to create the chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg72,6.22,6.22,So almost every consulting firm us it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg73,6.24,6.28,Of course if you do not have it,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,you can just also work with the regular,,,,,,,
,,,PowerPoint built chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg74,6.29,6.32,If you have the opportunity to use think,,,,,,,
,,,I can highly recommend it,,,,,,,
,,,because it really improves your workflow .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg75,6.34,6.37,If you now go over this chart tile,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,many of them you will already know,,,,,,,
,,,and probably frequently use yourself .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg76,6.39,6.42,Such a stacked bar chart or the 100 % bar chart,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,clustered bar chart and so on .,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg77,6.44,6.46,Right now I 'd just like to put your attention to,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,the waterfall chart type .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg78,6.48,6.52,So the waterfall chart type is a chart type,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,that in consulting,,,,,,,
,,,especially at McKinsey you will use all of the time .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg79,6.54,6.56,So there 's almost no presentation,,,,,,,
,,,without a waterfall present .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg80,6.58,6.58,But outside of consulting I really rarely see it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg81,7.01,7.01,Just from my observation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg82,7.03,7.08,The fact alone that a presentation includes a,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,waterfall chart very often is a clear telltale sign,,,,,,,
,,,that a MBB consulting firm worked on it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg83,7.11,7.18,And actually most of the case it ha been McKinsey,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,because for whatever reason,,,,,,,
,,,waterfall chart are just so commonly used,,,,,,,
,,,by McKinsey consultant .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg84,7.19,7.19,So let 's look at an example .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg85,7.2,7.22,So this is just a basic example,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,of what a waterfall chart look like .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg86,7.24,7.3,And I 'd just like to use this example to show to you,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,what I believe the waterfall chart can just be so,,,,,,,
,,,helpful in so many business presentation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg87,7.33,7.37,So this of course is just a stylist chart,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,an illustrative chart so let 's not,,,,,,,
,,,care about the specific number .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg88,7.38,7.38,But this is now a bridge chart .,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg89,7.41,7.43,Actually many people instead of using waterfall,,,,,,,
,,,they also just call them bridge .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg90,7.45,7.45,So bridge chart .,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg91,7.46,7.47,Because waterfall chart are very helpful,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,to show a bridge .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg92,7.49,7.49,To show how one number relates to another number .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg93,7.52,7.54,One way that this is frequently used,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,is to show bridge between financial figure .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg94,7.56,7.56,So here we compare the EBITDA .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg95,7.58,8.01,So the earnings before interest text depreciation,Interest,Impact,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,amortization of 2019 . To the EBITDA in 2020,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg96,8.01,8.04,and we like to understand the difference .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg97,8.07,8.08,And if you just look at the number,,,,,,,
,,,here it ha been 1.59 and here it ha been 1.67 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg98,8.12,8.15,So at first glance it could look like the number,,,,,,,
,,,are pretty similar .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg99,8.16,8.2,So you could infer,,,,,,,
,,,that actually the company ha been quite stable,,,,,,,
,,,there were many thing that actually changed .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg100,8.22,8.29,If you do n't break down the difference of these,,,,,,,
,,,two number into all the effect,,,,,,,
,,,that actually changed,,,,,,,
,,,from 2019,,,,,,,
,,,to 2020 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg101,8.31,8.32,You 'd see that there are quite,,,,,,,
,,,some thing going on .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg102,8.34,8.41,So here wa one effect that if you use,,,,,,,
,,,the EBITDA by 700,,,,,,,
,,,but then this is compensated by another effect,,,,,,,
,,,that increased it by 730 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg103,8.42,8.44,And there 's another positive effect,,,,,,,
,,,further increasing it by 450 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg104,8.46,8.48,And a reduction by 650,,,,,,,
,,,and then another increase in 250 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg105,8.5,8.57,So what you can see is that the waterfall chart,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,really enables you to breakdown,,,,,,,
,,,something into the different sub component,,,,,,,
,,,that were driving it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg106,8.58,9,And then enable it to make change visible,,,,,,,
,,,that were just not visible .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg107,9.03,9.05,Just looking at the total difference,,,,,,,
,,,between two number .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg108,9.06,9.06,Let 's now look into another,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,very ambiguous chart element .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg109,9.09,9.09,This is a so callout .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg110,9.12,9.12,This is this element right here .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg111,9.14,9.16,So this is an element that you can just,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,include in a chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg112,9.18,9.18,Gives detail about this specific element .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg113,9.21,9.25,So a I wrote here it can include remark,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,on specific element of a chart or other relevant,,,,,,,
,,,contribution that you wan na make .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg114,9.27,9.31,A callout is something that you can easily use,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,just add detail,,,,,,,
,,,add information,,,,,,,
,,,add context to one specific element .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg115,9.33,9.33,This is a frequent way how you can do it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg116,9.36,9.38,So this element just consists of one line,,,,,,,
,,,and then another line with a special ending .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg117,9.4,9.4,So if you ha never created this yourself .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg118,9.42,9.49,I just broke down here the element here,,,,,,,
,,,you see the line and that this is just,,,,,,,
,,,another line then it 's you can know in the line setting,,,,,,,
,,,you can just add also such an endpoint to it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg119,9.51,9.51,Then if you combine it this is what it look like .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg120,9.54,9.55,So this is just an easy way to create,,,,,,,
,,,this kind of callout element .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg121,9.57,10.01,And believe it or not but callouts like this,,,,,,,
,,,will be used in pretty much every single,,,,,,,
,,,consulting presentation that you see .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg122,10.03,10.05,Another element that might have catched your,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,attention is something that is called a sticker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg123,10.07,10.07,And this is what you see here in the top right .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg124,10.09,10.12,So a sticker is a qualification of the,,,,,,,
,,,page that you use .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg125,10.13,10.13,Here you see the preliminary sticker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg126,10.15,10.18,So let 's now just go over some example of sticker,,,,,,,
,,,that are frequently and commonly used .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg127,10.2,10.22,Then what the context is how you use them,Context,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,in the consulting context .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg128,10.24,10.28,So for discussion sticker,Discussion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,the preliminary sticker,,,,,,,
,,,highly preliminary indicative,,,,,,,
,,,and then illustrative .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg129,10.31,10.33,So these are probably the five,,,,,,,
,,,most commonly used sticker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg130,10.35,10.35,Of course you could write other thing a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg131,10.37,10.39,And sticker are element that are,,,,,,,
,,,pretty much used to protect yourself .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg132,10.41,10.5,So why could this be important ?,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,Why would you need to protect yourself ?,,,,,,,
,,,So let 's imagine you make an analysis,,,,,,,
,,,which might be a bit controversial,,,,,,,
,,,you know that their resides,,,,,,,
,,,will not please everybody .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg133,10.52,11.01,And what you can do is,Discussion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,to include such a for discussion sticker,Walk,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,then if you walk into a meeting,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,then you realize that your analysis spark,Discussion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,some discussion and then yet you can say,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,well  Yes of course this is not the final result . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg134,11.01,11.04, This is just for discussion . '',Discussion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg135,11.04,11.06,As you also wrote here .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg136,11.07,11.07, So let 's just have a discussion about it . '',Discussion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg137,11.07,11.08, I 'm interested to hear your opinion . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg138,11.08,11.15, What is your view of it ? '',Discussion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,, Why do you believe this is true ? '',,,,,,,
,,, What is your opinion ? '',,,,,,,
,,,So this is how you frequently use,,,,,,,
,,,such a for discussion sticker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg139,11.17,11.25,Preliminary and highly preliminary,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,this is just something to make clear,,,,,,,
,,,that the result that you 're showing,,,,,,,
,,,the analysis that you are doing,,,,,,,
,,,are not the final one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg140,11.27,11.32,And here again this just is a way to protect yourself,,,,,,,
,,,that then if later it come out that,,,,,,,
,,,maybe your were missing some data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg141,11.34,11.35,That there additional information that you,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,would need to take into consideration .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg142,11.37,11.4,You can just say  Yes of course this analysis that '',Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,, we did here wa only preliminary . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg143,11.4,11.43, This wa not the final version . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg144,11.43,11.58,This is also again to protect yourself,Engagement,Interactivity,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,because otherwise it could happen,,,,,,,
,,,and these thing happen right ?,,,,,,,
,,,That there is a hostile client,,,,,,,
,,,that then just point out a page that you created,,,,,,,
,,,maybe in the first week of your engagement,,,,,,,
,,,that you were just learning,,,,,,,
,,,trying to understand the data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg145,12,12.05,And the page you labeled you just did wa complete BS,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,because this analysis that you created,,,,,,,
,,,wa just obviously not correct .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg146,12.07,12.1,Right ?,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,And maybe he wa right maybe it just wa n't correct,,,,,,,
,,,because you did n't have the full picture .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg147,12.12,12.18,But then you can say  Yes Mister this is true you are '',Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,, right but a you can also read here this wa not a final '',,,,,,,
,,, version of the analysis . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg148,12.18,12.19, This wa just a preliminary version . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg149,12.19,12.21,And incident like that happen .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg150,12.23,12.23,And this is why you put the preliminary sticker on it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg151,12.25,12.27,That 's similar but different is the indicative sticker,,,,,,,
,,,and also the illustrative sticker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg152,12.29,12.35,So an indicative sticker you can use just to make,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,it clear that a certain analysis that you make,,,,,,,
,,,maybe ha some flaw,,,,,,,
,,,maybe ha some drawback .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg153,12.37,12.38,So the number that you show,,,,,,,
,,,should not be taken that serious .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg154,12.41,12.53,But it give a good direction,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,so that you believe that the analysis,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,the result that you show are at least are,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,indicatively right,,,,,,,
,,,and these show the right direction,,,,,,,
,,,the right picture,,,,,,,
,,,even thought the specific number that you use,,,,,,,
,,,might not be accurate .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg155,12.54,12.54,And this of course can happen in any situation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg156,12.56,13,You need to work with the incomplete data set,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,where you 're lacking certain information,,,,,,,
,,,that you just were not able to use .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg157,13.02,13.04,Then you might want to make it clear that the,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,analysis that you 're showing is just indicative .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg158,13.06,13.06,Illustrative go kind of even further than indicative .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg159,13.1,13.2,And it 's sometimes also used a bit in a dirty way,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,in the sense that you can show a whole chart of very,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,specific information very specific graph,Graph,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,then you can put an illustrative sticker on it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg160,13.22,13.23,You can make it clear that actually,,,,,,,
,,,the number are not true .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg161,13.25,13.29,That you just made up the whole chart right ?,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,Maybe the whole chart doe n't contain,,,,,,,
,,,any real number at all .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg162,13.32,13.36,But you just wanted to show a certain relationship,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,how you believe that it is from your experience,,,,,,,
,,,or maybe from other information that you have .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg163,13.38,13.48,So you 're just drawing this chart,Drawing,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,which maybe not even contains any real number at all,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,but illustratively this is the chart you believe,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,it look like .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg164,13.48,13.48,So this is how you put the illustrative sticker on it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg165,13.51,13.56,So if you see the illustrative sticker on a presentation,,,,,,,
,,,pretty frequently you can assume that actually,,,,,,,
,,,the number are not real .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg166,13.57,13.57,The number are not actual number .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg167,13.59,14.01,But this chart pretty much just wa made up,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,by the consultant who used it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg168,14.03,14.06,So now another element that you can frequently use,,,,,,,
,,,is something that is called a takeaway box .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg169,14.09,14.11,So takeaway box are something,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,like this that you include below your chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg170,14.14,14.14,It includes an important overall remark .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg171,14.16,14.21,So while the callout you saw earlier,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,usually is used for just given information on,,,,,,,
,,,a specific element of the chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg172,14.23,14.28,If you ever have genuine information,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,that is relevant to the whole chart,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,you can just include such a takeaway box,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,below the chart that you are showing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg173,14.3,14.38,In the takeaway box you can just include the main insight,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,the main piece of information,,,,,,,
,,,that you want the reader the viewer the listener,,,,,,,
,,,to takeaway from the chart that you are showing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg174,14.41,14.44,Another element that you can use that look similar,,,,,,,
,,,but is often used in a slightly different way .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg175,14.45,14.45,It is something that you would call a bubble .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg176,14.48,14.56,So bubble is sometimes also called a sticker,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,and it 's included in a chart in some way like that,,,,,,,
,,,so you purposely make it look like this,,,,,,,
,,,just included in front of something else .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg177,14.59,15.01,It look a bit le informal than for instance,,,,,,,
,,,a takeaway box .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg178,15.02,15.07,And a bubble you often use to include,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,some kind of limitation,,,,,,,
,,,to the analysis that you are showing a,,,,,,,
,,,limitation to the data that you are showing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg179,15.09,15.15,And a bubble is called a bubble,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,because sometimes instead of a rectangular form,,,,,,,
,,,you can also use a circular form of the text that,,,,,,,
,,,you are showing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg180,15.16,15.19,So that the text is included in a circle,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,instead of a rectangular form .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg181,15.2,15.24,From the standpoint bubble are so important,,,,,,,
,,,you need to put yourself into the shoe,,,,,,,
,,,of a consultant .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg182,15.25,15.29,Because very frequently you receive certain data set,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,certain information from your client .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg183,15.31,15.35,And then you take several day,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,or maybe even week to then conduct the analysis,,,,,,,
,,,and then to come up with some kind of a result .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg184,15.37,15.56,Then very often what happens is that then,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,the last day some anxious hour before,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,the big presentation,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,where you then want to show the result,,,,,,,
,,,you receive some new information,,,,,,,
,,,maybe you realize that now some new data came out,,,,,,,
,,,maybe now the next month 's finished,,,,,,,
,,,and now you put re all the analysis,,,,,,,
,,,with all the data from the new time period,,,,,,,
,,,from the new month .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg185,15.57,16.14,In these situation you 're very frequently faced with,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,the decision to whether you want to re now,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,all the analysis,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,to incorporate this new information or whether,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,will you leave all the analysis as ?,,,,,,,
,,,And then just include a bubble on the page,,,,,,,
,,,stating the limitation or stating what ha not,,,,,,,
,,,yet been included in the analysis .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg186,16.17,16.22,Bubbles are so important because very frequently,Analysis,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,instead of re the whole thing re analysis,,,,,,,
,,,re all kind of page .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg187,16.24,16.24,Problems like that you can frequently use with the bubble .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg188,16.27,16.36,And this is why there is a magic saying in consulting,,,,,,,
,,,and this go like  If in trouble use a bubble ! '',,,,,,,
,,,So if you are struggling with something,,,,,,,
,,,something just is n't right .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg189,16.38,16.43,You just need to use this statement,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,just need to make some correction,,,,,,,
,,,in the end if you 're in trouble,,,,,,,
,,,most of the problem you can just use with a bubble .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg190,16.46,16.46,Just stating the specific thing that you want to change .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg191,16.49,16.51,Now some other frequently used element,,,,,,,
,,,are circle with number .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg192,16.54,17.03,This again is something that I very frequently,,,,,,,
,,,see in consulting presentation,,,,,,,
,,,but I rarely see line of circle with number like that in,,,,,,,
,,,presentation that are being done by non people .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg193,17.05,17.05,So how do you use these thing .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg194,17.08,17.11,So you can use these kind of number circle whenever,,,,,,,
,,,you want to include another layer of data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg195,17.14,17.16,Another dimension of number,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,which is not directly part of the chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg196,17.19,17.19,So let 's look at this stylized chart .,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg197,17.21,17.22,So what do we see here ?,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,So these are the revenue figure of a business .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg198,17.24,17.26,But not the absolute figure,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,but the difference to the previous year .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg199,17.29,17.33,So we look into these calendar week,,,,,,,
,,,and we look into how the business performed,,,,,,,
,,,against the previous year .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg200,17.34,17.41,So here so this would mean that in the calendar,,,,,,,
,,,week seven of the year,,,,,,,
,,,the business had revenue that were by a 100 million higher,,,,,,,
,,,than in the previous year .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg201,17.43,17.46,You have 200 million higher 250 million higher,,,,,,,
,,,here a 100 million le and so on .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg202,17.49,17.55,Of course in this context if you look at this,Context,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,it would be interesting and important to u,,,,,,,
,,,to include what the absolute amount,,,,,,,
,,,what the revenue wa in the current year 2020 .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg203,17.58,18.04,In situation like that where you just want to include a,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,a second point of data second point of information,,,,,,,
,,,circle of number like that are just very commonly used .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg204,18.08,18.18,So here you would now include information,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,that in the calendar week seven,,,,,,,
,,,you make now the revenue of 900 million,,,,,,,
,,,and this wa 100 million more,,,,,,,
,,,than you made in the previous year .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg205,18.2,18.27,Then regarding the legend what you do is,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,the main legend that you state in the chart title,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,the main legend always refers to the,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,number in the main chart .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg206,18.29,18.32,And for the circle you can include a sub,,,,,,,
,,,then explain what is shown and depicted in these circle .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg207,18.36,18.39,And if you 're interested to learn more about how to set up,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,consulting style chart like that .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg208,18.41,18.46,I created a whole other video just discussing,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,how you should set up the chart title,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,then also the subtitle and thing like that .,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg209,18.48,18.56,So if you have n't seen that yet,,,,,,,
,,,I believe this is also highly relevant,,,,,,,
,,,and something that you need to know,,,,,,,
,,,if you work in consulting,,,,,,,
,,,or want to create presentation that meet the,,,,,,,
,,,standard of consulting firm .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg210,18.58,19,I will leave it above here for you,,,,,,,
,,,check it out if you 'd like to see it a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg211,19.02,19.05,Next concept I would like to talk about is also a,,,,,,,
,,,very very important one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg212,19.07,19.07,And it 's the concept of clothesline .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg213,19.09,19.09,More specifically of avoiding clothesline .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg214,19.13,19.25,So what do we call clothesline in consulting ?,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,Clotheslines are referred to a just long list of thing,Context,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,and specifically in the context,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,of creating PowerPoint presentation,,,,,,,
,,,just long list of bullet .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg215,19.27,19.36,So what you will always never see in,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,consulting style presentation,,,,,,,
,,,is just the list of bullet like that,,,,,,,
,,,where you just randomly list all kind of thought,,,,,,,
,,,or other explanation that you want to .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg216,19.38,19.45,So why is this bad ?,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,So if you just use a list of thought like this,,,,,,,
,,,what you 're missing what you 're not showing,,,,,,,
,,,what you 're not doing is giving it some kind of structure .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg217,19.49,19.5,If you present thing like that,,,,,,,
,,,it look completely random .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg218,19.53,20,The person looking at it,,,,,,,
,,,can have no trust at all that actually the thing,,,,,,,
,,,that are mentioned here are complete,,,,,,,
,,,that all the relevant aspect,,,,,,,
,,,have been discussed and addressed by you .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg219,20.02,20.04,But it just seems like a completely random,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,unstructured list of point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg220,20.07,20.09,In such an unstructured list of point,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,is what you would call a clothesline .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg221,20.11,20.11,And you want to avoid clothesline .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg222,20.13,20.19,So what is now used in consulting to avoid,,,,,Structure,,
,,,clothesline like that ?,,,,,,,
,,,And very frequently,,,,,,,
,,,what you do is to use structure element .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg223,20.21,20.27,So here again just in the illustrative page,,,,,,,
,,,this could be out of for instance an M & A transaction,,,,,,,
,,,a merger 's and acquisition transaction .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg224,20.28,20.28,Where one company aim to buy another company .,Aim,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg225,20.31,20.4,Another company is showing how the purchasing price,,,,,,,
,,,that they want to offer for a company split down,,,,,,,
,,,to the different asset that the company ha,,,,,,,
,,,and that the company is selling .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg226,20.42,20.45,Here again this is now,Chart,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,another frequent use of a waterfall chart,,,,,,,
,,,that you now have the total purchasing price .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg227,20.47,20.51,Now you show how this break down into the different,,,,,,,
,,,subelements of the company .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg228,20.53,20.55,Now here you have the different asset that the company,,,,,,,
,,,ha to offer u so here property plant and equipment .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg229,20.58,21.02,Then of course there could be a whole lot of other,,,,,,,
,,,asset that the company offer,,,,,,,
,,,for instance inventory and so on .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg230,21.04,21.07,Now a clothesline would be just to state all these asset,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,just in a random list of bullet .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg231,21.09,21.11,Now to avoid clothesline,,,,,Structure,,
,,,what you often use is structure element .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg232,21.14,21.23,So what you try is to define bucket,BulletPoint,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,to define group of element,,,,,,,
,,,then you can use to organize the different subelements,,,,,,,
,,,that are from bullet point that you have .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg233,21.25,21.33,Now here just a simple example is to use gray bar,,,,,,,
,,,that you include in front of the element,,,,,,,
,,,then the company you will often distinguish the,,,,,,,
,,,fixed asset from the current asset .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg234,21.36,21.39,This is now a structure that I defined,,,,,Structure,,
,,,in that in this structure,,,,,Structure,,
,,,now I can use a different bullet point .,BulletPoint,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg235,21.42,21.44,And I hope you now understand that this is superior,,,,,,,
,,,to other way of structuring the point .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg236,21.45,21.56,Because now by having to use the structure,,,,,Structure,,
,,,fixed asset and current asset,,,,,,,
,,,I already have some kind of guarantee,,,,,,,
,,,that if I now look at these two type of asset,,,,,,,
,,,I will catch all the asset,,,,,,,
,,,that are included in the company .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg237,21.59,22.01,Because this way now I have covered,,,,,,,
,,,the whole balance sheet of the company .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg238,22.02,22.06,And I can be sure that I will have covered all,,,,,,,
,,,the asset within these two group .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg239,22.08,22.13,So always use structure element,,,,,Structure,,
,,,avoid at all cost using clothesline,,,,,,,
,,,because this is just completely unprofessional .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg240,22.14,22.17,This is probably one of the first point of feedback,Feedback,AudienceDesire,Audience,,Delivery,,
,,,that you will get a a young consultant .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg241,22.19,22.21,If you created a page just using,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,a list of bullet point like this .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg242,22.22,22.27,So this concludes my little list of tip and trick,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,of element that you can use to,,,,,,,
,,,improve your PowerPoint page a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg243,22.29,22.29,I hope you found this wa useful .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg244,22.31,22.35,If you have any question about that,Section,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,feel free to leave me a comment below,,,,,,,
,,,in the comment section .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
PgOD1j2DhNg245,22.36,22.47,I will answer every single comment,,,,,,,
,,,and I also like to hear from you,,,,,,,
,,,what are your little tip ?,,,,,,,
,,,What are the thing that you 've frequently use,,,,,,,
,,,to improve your presentation ?,,,,,,,
,,,Let 's have a conversation here from which,,,,,,,
,,,everybody can benefit .,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ1,0,0.08,You 're probably tuning into this talk because you 're interested in improving your speaking skill and you know let 's face it none of u really have had a lot of explicit training,,,,,,,
,,,in presentation a scientist . So ok we 're not expert . We may not be expert at public speaking,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ2,0.08,0.08,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ3,0.08,0.16,but I would actually suggest to you that we are all expert at listening to talk . Think about the number of hour that each of u ha sat in a chair in a lecture room,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ4,0.16,0.33,in a seminar in an auditorium listened to journal club to all kind of talk,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,we 've spent hour and hour and hour listening to talk . So we 're expert at knowing what a good talk is because we know what we want delivered a an audience member .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ5,0.33,0.33,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ6,0.44,0.44,So if you think about it why do we go to a talk ? Well we 're interested obviously in learning some about interesting and novel science .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ7,0.52,0.58,We are going to listen to speaker who we think are credible and knowledgeable,,,,,,,
,,,and doing novel work . We are responsive to speaker who are enthusiastic and who just keep u awake,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ8,0.58,1.23,and we want a talk that is well organized clear a talk that we can follow a talk that 's not laden down with jargon,,,,,,,
,,,and a talk that give u enough background to understand what 's going on we want to be able to see the data understand it interpret it,,,,,,,
,,,and then make our own decision about the science . So we 're all expert at listening to talk why ca n't we just translate what we know,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ9,1.23,1.31,we want a an audience member into how we give a talk a individual .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ10,1.37,1.37,Let 's think about something ; how many time have we each seen a slide like this . We 've seen it a zillion time right we 're sitting there in a chair,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ11,1.37,1.46,listening to a seminar a slide like this come on . And we have no idea of what to look at .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ12,1.46,1.46,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ13,1.52,1.58,Are we supposed to read all of this text ? Are we supposed to look at this figure or that figure,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,or that figure ? We 're overwhelmed visually and we 've all seen this slide a thousand time . Now I just want to make a quick disclaimer .,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ14,1.58,1.58,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ15,2.05,2.12,This wa not my work and I 'm not suggesting for a second that the author of this really gorgeous paper,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,would have shown a slide like that . But if I were giving a journal club on that topic I might have produced a slide like this for you,Topic,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ16,2.12,2.19,in trying to tell you about these data . So when we think about what we know instinctively is just a disaster why do we keep doing it,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ17,2.19,2.39,again and again and again ? I think that we need to know some basic rule about power point,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,and how to structure a talk in order to enable these visuals to work effectively,,,,,,,
,,,a we 're teaching a we 're speaking about our own science a we 're presenting journal club .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ18,2.45,3,So what I 'm going to do is first of all go through some basic about power point and then we 're going to think about how you structure a talk,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,in order to lead a member of the audience through the data in a way that they will understand each piece that you 're presenting and,,,,,Structure,,
,,,be able to really understand what the take message is . First of all what font should you use ?,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ19,3,3.06,It turn out that some of the default font in power point and keynote are exactly wrong . The font you should use is a Sans Serif font .,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ20,3.06,3.06,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ21,3.14,3.2,What is a Sans Serif font ? San Serif font are font without little doober line,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,and stuff at the bottom of letter . And that 's to be contrasted with Serif font which have all the little doober at the bottom of each letter .,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ22,3.2,3.2,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ23,3.28,3.39,So why do you use one and not the other ? Well visual psychophysicist have discovered that using a Sans Serif font when you 're projecting text,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,onto a screen like this make it easier for the audience to read the text quickly . These font down here the Serif font this is the font if you have novel you were going to read it in bed,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ24,3.39,3.5,it 's very easy to read . And that 's why book are printed with Serif font but you should choose and there are a range of choice that you can make,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ25,3.5,3.59,one of the Sans Serif font for your scientific presentation . How big should your font be ?,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ26,3.59,4.04,Again be careful of some of the default font size . One of the default in Power Point is astronomically huge,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ27,4.04,4.11,bigger than this one right here it 's like 42 . It 's way too big ! You do n't need that . So the range of font size that you should use are shown here .,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ30,4.19,4.19,Anywhere from 18 down to 36 with one exception . We often in our scientific presentation will want to insert a reference to a published paper,Reference,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ31,4.19,4.28,which is n't really the focus of the slide but we want to have it up there for scientific accuracy .,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ32,4.34,4.34,So under those circumstance you might use a 14 point font to put your reference at the bottom of the slide .,Font,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ33,4.42,4.42,Other than that just work in this range and you 'll be good . Avoid using capital letter . This make it clear why .,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ35,4.42,4.42,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ36,4.49,4.49,It 's actually really hard to read all capitol . And secondly in this age of email I think we all know that capitalizing everything,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ37,4.49,4.57,is the visual equivalent of shouting at someone . So it 's just not polite . In addition when you 're thinking about title,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ38,4.57,4.57,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ39,4.57,5.04,or how you would actually capitalize word use a sentence format . In other word do n't capitalize every word,Format,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ40,5.04,5.11,of your title or your text down here . Having capital of every word slows down the eye and make it difficult to read .,Title,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ41,5.11,5.11,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ42,5.2,5.26,So remember the text and the slide is really there for the audience to be able to read quickly,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and easily . Color scheme are really important and thinking about the background of your slide .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ43,5.26,5.26,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ44,5.33,5.4,Now we 've all seen a lot of slide that have very fancy background and in fact,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,you want the simplest possible background . For example a plain white background with dark letter,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ45,5.4,5.45,either black or blue . That work very well ; it 's high in contrast,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ46,5.45,5.51,and the only thing that appears on the slide is the information that your audience need to understand this slide in the context of your talk .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ47,5.59,5.59,Avoid using the fancy patterned background .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ48,6.05,6.05,You do n't need your company or university logo on every slide . You do not need a DNA double helix,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ49,6.05,6.11,running down every slide . All of that is extraneous . Maybe it might appear on your first slide but then get rid of it .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ50,6.11,6.11,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ51,6.11,6.11,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ52,6.18,6.18,Streamline it down to a simple a possible and think about the contrast of letter .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ53,6.24,6.24,So dark against light work really well light against dark work very well . A black background with white letter,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ54,6.24,6.3,or bright yellow . Again high contrast easy for the audience to read . When should you use which ? Well if you were to give a talk,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ55,6.3,6.3,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ56,6.3,6.49,for example at a very large symposium with hundred of people a very big room psycophysically and in term of the projector,Projector,VisualAidDevice,,,VisualAid,,
,,,the contrast is greatest if you use a dark background and light letter under that context .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ57,6.55,6.55,So it 's easier to project at high contrast . If you 're teaching in a small room or you 're in a circumstance where you 're worried about people staying awake,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ58,6.55,7.07,then I would use a white background with dark letter . That is actually more effective .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ59,7.07,7.07,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ60,7.13,7.13,However you do want to think about your science . For example in my science I use a lot of fluorescence photomicrograph where I actually prefer a dark background,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ61,7.13,7.25,because the contrast I want people to be dark adapted so they can really see my data .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ62,7.3,7.3,So in one of my scientific seminar regardless of whether I 'm in a small room or a big room I use a black background .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ63,7.36,7.36,It just work better for my science . There are certain color combination that you should avoid . Red/green is bad :,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ64,7.36,7.36,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ65,7.36,7.44,this is incredibly difficult to look at . In addition a large fraction of the population is red color blind,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ66,7.44,7.51,and finally red is really angry color . I actually saw an entire seminar once with the background color of the slide that wa red and,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,

,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ67,7.51,8.01,I wa so agitated by ten minute into the talk so avoid that . Other color combination can be equally bad,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ68,8.01,8.16,and this is bad not because the color are unpleasant but because the contrast here is not big enough,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,for an audience member to actually read the letter against this background . This is important because in science we 're often,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ69,8.16,8.3,creating for example these cartoon of for example of a signal transduction pathway,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,where you want each protein to be a different color . So we 're always looking for a new color for a new protein a we 're going through,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ70,8.3,8.43,a flow of talk but we want to make sure that each protein that might in fact be this blue color,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,would then have a label on top of it that 's high contrast . For example for this it might be black instead of green .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ71,8.43,8.43,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ72,8.49,8.49,Let 's think now about how to lay out a slide visually in Power Point so that it 's really easy for an audience member to follow the content of your talk .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ73,8.59,9.08,First of all I strongly recommend that every slide a heading at the top and the best heading is actually a statement a simple sentence,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,that say in plain english what the bottom line of the slide is . Now you might say Sue excuse me this is not a statement and you 're right,Heading,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,

,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ74,9.08,9.22,ok busted this is really going through an outline for this particular talk but in my science talk,Outline,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,every slide is headed by a statement . If you 're going to include text in a slide it 's very important to just limit the amount of text .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ75,9.22,9.22,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ76,9.32,9.38,I really strongly urge you to use no more than two line of text,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,in a text block . Why is that ? The minute you show a big block of text like this I have lost you a an audience member .,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ77,9.38,9.38,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ78,9.45,9.45,You do n't know at this point whether you should be reading all of this stuff or listening to me .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ79,9.51,9.56,And if you a an audience member are now distracted and confused about what you should be doing,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,I a a speaker have lost control of my talk . So do n't use thing like this there 's one exception there might be a wonderful quotation that you want to include in your talk .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ80,9.56,9.56,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ81,10.07,10.15,For example a quote from The Double Helix or a quote from the beautiful writing of Ramon y Cajal,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,if you 're a neurobiologist . And under those circumstance it 's great to include the full text . What I recommend you do if you do include a quotation is rather than read it word by word,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ82,10.15,10.15,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ83,10.15,10.25,instead sort of paraphrase it a you 're going along . You might say well the reason for limiting block of text to just two line is,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ84,10.25,10.32,if it go on forever people in the audience are going to have to make this huge effort to read it and that will preclude them from paying attention to what you 're saying .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ85,10.4,10.4,So you can paraphrase a quote that 's very effective unless it is very poetic and you want to do a dramatic reading and that 's fine too .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ86,10.47,10.47,Lists should be short ; try to limit your list to just three item .,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ87,10.54,11.02,Avoid like mad long list and if you 're going to have a list I strongly recommend that you use the animation feature in PowerPoint,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,to unveil your list one at a time . So when you 're talking about item one in your talk,List,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Animation,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ88,11.02,11.07,that will appear . And only when you 're ready to talk about item two,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ89,11.07,11.12,doe that second item appear and likewise when you 're ready to include item three that will come up a well .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ90,11.18,11.18,Be very generous in a slide with empty space . It 's more effective it 's more powerful for the audience .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ91,11.18,11.18,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ92,11.26,11.26,And this is why . If you start to just load your slide with stuff it 's visually overwhelming and often you can get into a situation,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ93,11.26,11.41,we 've all been in seminar before where something is very very very close to the edge of the slide,Close,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and there 's a slight misalignment between the projector and the screen that then result in stuff getting cut off .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ94,11.49,11.49,And we 've all been at talk where someone say `` oh I 'm sorry If you could have seen the slide then you would have been able to read it . '',Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ95,11.49,11.55,Well just leaving some space at the different edge the boundary of the slide and do n't forget about leaving some space at the bottom .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ96,12.03,12.11,If you 're in a room where everyone is sitting at the same level people in the back are trying to see over one another 's head,Close,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,so if you 're stuff is too close to bottom some people in the back ca n't see it . So leave space on all three side and a little space at the top again for the misalignment problem .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ97,12.11,12.11,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ98,12.19,12.19,Ok let 's think about the style of these slide . I urge you,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ99,12.19,12.31,most wholeheartedly to include a simple image,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,on every slide . What most slide ? No every slide . In every slide of one of my scientific presentation there is an image .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ101,12.31,12.31,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ102,12.4,12.4,Why is that ? Here 's the deal . We audience member who are listening to a talk take in and process information,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ103,12.4,12.48,in quite different way from one another . Some of u are reader and that 's the reason for having a sentence at the top of each slide .,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ104,12.48,12.48,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ105,12.57,12.57,Some of u are going to take in information by reading . Others of u are very visual . If we have an image on the slide,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ106,12.57,12.57,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ107,12.57,13.04,then that appeal to the vision we 're primate we 're very visually oriented so we communicate through picture .,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ108,13.1,13.1,And the third way we talk in information is by listening . The ideal the perfect power point slide represents an absolutely,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ109,13.1,13.2,synchronous match between a simple statement at the top a simple visual and what you a a speaker are saying .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ110,13.3,13.3,So that the same content is being delivered through all three channel at the same time without any distraction .,Distraction,Attention,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ111,13.38,13.44,Make your slide simple limit the number of stuff you included in each slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and just make one or two point from each slide . Now we 've all heard this rule maybe most of u have heard a rule,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ112,13.44,13.58,how many slide should you show in a particular scientific presentation ? And the rule that I learned and the rule that perhaps you learned a well,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,the rule is you show one slide per minute . So if you 're giving a twenty minute talk,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ113,13.58,14.03,you show twenty slide . I would argue now that that might have been true when slide were actually on film,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ114,14.03,14.12,and difficult to manipulate and there wa no such thing a animation . Now that we have tool like PowerPoint and Keynote,Animation,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ115,14.12,14.24,that enable u to build content progressively in slide and to have thing that are simple,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,simple point that we can easily change from talk to talk that rule doe n't really hold anymore .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ116,14.31,14.31,And I do n't think there is a firm rule I think it really depends on the amount of information that you 're delivering in a talk .,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ117,14.37,14.48,So make your slide simple do n't worry about this one slide per minute rule and rather get feedback from a you practice a talk,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ119,14.54,15.08,and what doe the speaker do ? The speaker doe this the speaker say `` I know this slide is really busy but the only thing I really want you to look at,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ121,15.14,15.2,What ha the speaker just told you ? The speaker 's just said I 'm too lazy to have created a slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,that is actually tailored for what I want to show you . And we a audience member are looking at all of this stuff,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ122,15.2,15.46,we even if we 're told to look at this I mean how many of u behave ? I personally I 'm looking this and I 'm wondering about that,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,so the speaker ha not only shown a little bit of disrespect and laziness to u in my opinion,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,but in addition the speaker ha lost u a audience member because we 're now wandering around the slide,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and wondering we 're having our own thought . So if you 're going to show a slide like this simply take the data that,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ123,15.46,15.53,you want to show eliminate everything else and put that up . And then explain the data completely .,,,,,,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ136,17.17,17.22,So you can take complex figure export them and simply them,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,in order to fit perfectly with your presentation . We have all seen a lot of especially with the introduction of Keynote,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ137,17.22,17.33,some very fancy transition between slide . What do me mean by transition ? Well,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ138,17.33,17.39,in my talk so far when I 've advanced the slide you simply see the new slide . Remember when Keynote came out and the first time you were at a talk,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ139,17.39,18.04,and the speaker advanced to the next slide and the slide formed a box and the box rotated in 3 dimension and then a new slide appeared,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and you thought `` Oh that 's really cool that wa wild ! '' and then the speaker got their advance and they advanced to the second slide and,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,the slide then did a big spiral and then the new slide appeared and by the third or fourth time that the speaker did that you felt nauseated .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ140,18.13,18.13,We yeah so avoid these fancy transition they are not in service of the talk . There is an exception though .,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ141,18.13,18.13,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ142,18.21,18.21,There are some transition that actually illustrate in a very subtle way action . Here 's an example . This is a slide that I 've shown in some of my presentation,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ143,18.21,18.21,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ144,18.21,18.3,that have talked about the migration of neuron in the developing brain . And in this particular talk the point I wanted to make wa that we would take out neuron,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ145,18.3,18.4,from a very small region and culture them . So I used a very simple wipe transition . Watch this it 's subtle but there 's the transition .,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ146,18.4,18.4,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ147,18.4,18.4,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ148,18.49,18.49,It actually wipe from one side to the other . That sort of mimic the act of taking something out of the brain and putting it into culture .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ149,18.49,18.49,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ150,18.55,19,So that 's a sensible use another sensible use would be if you 're going to zoom in on something,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,if you 're going to zoom in on this region you might use a zoom transition . Apart from that just advance from one slide to the next with a simple transition .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ151,19,19,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ152,19.09,19.09,Do n't drown the audience with data .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ153,19.15,19.33,What make a talk memorable is when a speaker communicates,Memorable,Impact,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,a couple of take message in a way that present just enough data,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,to be convincing but not so much data that the audience is just flooded with information,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,and ca n't process it . Less is more and here 's a way to think about it . Those of u who are biologist,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ154,19.33,19.33,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ155,19.33,19.41,are used to culturing cell in minimum essential medium . Just enough of the critical nutrient and element and vitamin,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ156,19.41,19.55,that a cell need to survive and nothing extra . Minimum essential medium . Now if you take out any one of those element in the medium,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ157,19.55,19.55,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ158,19.55,20.05,the cell will die . Adding more doe n't add any value to your culture .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ159,20.05,20.05,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ160,20.11,20.17,So if we think about minimum essential medium we can also think about,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,minimum essential data . Just the data that you need to convince the audience of the credibility of your science and no more .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ161,20.17,20.17,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ162,20.25,20.32,That 's really difficult and I think that 's the most difficult decision that we have to make,,,,,,,
,,,in term of presenting a seminar . What is just enough ? And where 's the line between just enough and not too much .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ163,20.32,20.32,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ164,20.39,20.54,For that experience help a lot but also getting feedback from your colleague when you 're practicing your talk to ask people can I get rid of this ? What can go ?,Feedback,AudienceDesire,Audience,,Delivery,,
,,,Do n't ask what can I add ask what can go ? To make this convincing and thorough,,,,,,,
,,,and yet not too much . So I think we all realize it 's really easy to use PowerPoint badly,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ165,20.54,21.12,right ? So we 've seen a zillion example like this of people presenting journal club or seminar,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,you see a slide like that we a audience member are visually overwhelmed we 're lost we do n't know what to look at,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,we ca n't read this stuff it 's too much to read we 're distracted . The minute a slide like this go up the speaker ha lost the audience completely .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ166,21.12,21.12,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ167,21.2,21.37,So it take a lot of work do n't get me wrong it take time to use PowerPoint or Keynote effectively in a seminar because you have to think carefully,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,about what you need to present what you NEED to present not what you want to present not what you 'd love to present but what you need to present,Graphic,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,and to present it using clear simple graphic and clear simple text . So in fact let 's go through an exercise .,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ168,21.37,21.37,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ169,21.47,21.47,Let 's take that previous slide from this lovely paper from JCB which I actually presented for a journal club many year ago .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ170,21.54,21.54,Let 's take that previous slide which is figure 2 from that paper and let 's see how we can break it down into it minimum essential component .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ171,22.02,22.02,The first decision that we have to make in term of looking at all the data in this figure is what stay and what go . What 's the minimum essential data ?,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ172,22.02,22.1,What are excuse my grammatical error there what are the minimum essential data ? that we need in order to present in our journal club .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ173,22.17,22.17,And we might decide at that point that this particular part of the figure panel b can go . It 's not essential but everything else is .,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ174,22.17,22.17,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ175,22.24,22.24,So how do we present that ? Well let 's deploy our PowerPoint rule in this context . First of all I 'm going show you how I 'd present panel a . Look at it for a second,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ176,22.24,22.24,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ177,22.24,22.33,it 's got some result in a gel and it 's got some image of cell . How might I do that ? Well,Result,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ178,22.33,22.39,here 's the first figure here 's the first slide in presenting this figure . Notice that there 's a sentence at the top and then I 've taken the data,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ179,22.39,22.49,from the figure and I 've added some stuff over here . I 've added two label that help the audience,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ180,22.49,22.54,understand immediately that this is a PCR product and this is actually a Western blot .,Product,Prop,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ181,22.59,22.59,So I 've added some stuff to be helpful to the audience but I 've simplified their focus so there 's a good match between showing this and having the text .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,Text,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ182,23.07,23.07,And what I would be saying if I were actually presenting a journal club . And then using a simple animation,Animation,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ183,23.07,23.13,I would then unveil the rest of this panel . And I 've added something for this audience down here,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ184,23.13,23.19,showing you that this is actually a photomicrograph of MDCK cell .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ185,23.25,23.25,So that 's panel a presented in really two part using a simple animation and some addition . The next thing I might want to show actually come from panel c,Animation,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ186,23.25,23.34,of that figure . And I 've added a bunch of stuff here to be audience friendly . First of all notice that there 's a sentence at the top a statement of what 's going on .,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ187,23.34,23.34,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ188,23.34,23.34,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ189,23.44,23.5,I 'm showing just one simple panel I 've added a label and I 've added this statement to help the audience that,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,we 're looking down at the surface of these cell . from the lumen . I 've also added some color coding so that they know what protein are visualized,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ190,23.5,23.5,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ191,23.5,24,in different color . That wa n't in the original figure I added that because who is this slide for ? It 's for the audience .,Color,EmphasisedText,Text,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,

,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ192,24,24,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ193,24.06,24.06,The audience need this . And then using an animation we 'll then show a side view of the same cell that ' s the control cell . Now watch what happens .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ194,24.06,24.06,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ195,24.06,24.06,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ196,24.14,24.21,Two thing happen ; the sentence at the top change cause there 's a new message and we 've added the contrasting view,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,of the cell that have this particular protein knocked down . Let 's now think about the last part a new sentence that really state that,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ197,24.21,24.3,this protein is essential for these cell to form little microvilli and in the absence of protein they do n't .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ198,24.37,24.44,So now we 've presented that complicated figure in a few part using some simple animation,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,in a very audience format . So what 's the bottom line with PowerPoint ? Make simple slide simple slide that make one or two point .,Animation,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ199,24.44,24.44,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ200,24.52,24.52,Build your content progressively using animation rather than present everything all at once .,Animation,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ201,24.58,24.58,Just show one PowerPoint and Keynote they 're all about control . They 're controlling what people see what you 're saying and what they 're reading,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ202,24.58,25.08,and have all those match at the same time . And remember if you 're not going to talk about it just leave it out .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ203,25.08,25.08,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ204,25.15,25.15,If you 're not going to explain it it doe n't belong there at all . It go . Ok that 's what I wanted to tell you about PowerPoint I hope that 's helpful .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ205,25.15,25.15,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ206,25.15,25.15,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ207,25.24,25.24,And now we want to transition into thinking more broadly about how to structure a talk .,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ208,25.31,25.31,So that it organization is clear to the audience . And I think about it a almost taking someone by the hand,Organization,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ209,25.31,25.42,and walking them through the science right and saying here 's what I want you to see now,Walking,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,and here 's the path that we 're following here 's where we 've just been and here 's where we 're going . So a good talk is like a good paper it ha a structure,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ210,25.42,25.57,right a good talk start out with a big question and then we build content over time we go through the meat of the talk,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and then we end with a conclusion that basically reach back out to the big issue that we started with .,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ211,26.02,26.02,Same way a we write a paper why are so bad at actually doing this at talk ? Well if we discipline ourselves to do it I think we can do it better .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ212,26.1,26.25,I 'd like to show you an example from one of my own seminar of how I actually structure an introduction to define the really big question,,,,,Structure,,
,,,and then give enough background information to enable the audience to be able to follow the meat of the talk,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,in the middle . And a I 'm doing that I also want to show you a trick that I 've learned,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Middle,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ213,26.25,26.31,that I think is extraordinarily effective at giving good talk .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ214,26.36,26.36,And that 's an idea that I call something like a home slide or a home image . It 's a picture,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ215,26.36,26.5,maybe a cartoon an image of some sort that is going to signal to the audience,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,that you 're at a point in the talk where you 're going to make a transition . It 's a little signal to the audience to perk up because you 're going to tell them where you 've just been,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ216,26.5,26.59,what it mean and where you 're going next . So a I show you the introduction to one of my talk,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ217,26.59,27.09,I 'm going to build up into a home slide that you 'll see a little bit later,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,is going to come up again and again and again at transition . You might feel a little bit jarred because now the background of the slide is going to change from white to black,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ218,27.09,27.16,and this jarred feeling that you might experience is one of the reason that I think it 's actually quite important in a talk to keep the same color background throughout the entire thing .,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ219,27.25,27.25,So here we go . So here 's the first slide from my standard seminar and notice first of all that my name and institution appear right here .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ220,27.25,27.25,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ221,27.32,27.39,Why is that ? Well because people in the audience may be taking note and they might want to write down your name and they 'll want to know how to spell it correctly,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,so it 's a courtesy to them . So a I start in my talk I start to discus,Note,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,

,,,,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ222,27.39,27.55,a kind of analogy between the brain which is what we study and a computer chip because each of them ha to make really specific connection with one another,Analogy,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,the brain during development and the computer chip in a factory . And I make kind of a joke and see if people laugh and gauge the humor level of my audience at that point .,Computer,VisualAidDevice,,,VisualAid,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ224,28.03,28.22,And then I show the audience the cell that I actually work on the actual circuitry of the brain,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,that my lab study in the cerebral cortex and then I frame the major question that my lab is interested in,Frame,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,which really ha to do with the question of how it is that these individual neuron in the brain know,Connection,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,what kind of connection to form what are the molecular mechanism that guide those choice about cell fate and connectivity .,Guide,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ225,28.29,28.42,At this point then I introduce the two cell type that the talk will focus on,Focus,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,two set of neuron that you 'll see have different color and then I introduce two question that the talk will address,,,,,,,
,,,during the course of the next however long it is maybe a forty minute seminar . One question having to do with the fate of the yellow cell,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ226,28.42,28.5,and another question having to do with the fate of the blue cell . And that basically then launch me into the actual data part of the talk .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ227,28.5,28.5,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ228,29.02,29.07,This particular image right here is the `` home image '',Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ229,29.07,29.16,in my talk during transition . And we 'll see just in a couple of minute how that can get played out,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ230,29.16,29.21,and how it can be extraordinarily effective in enabling the audience to follow a talk .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ231,29.27,29.27,Ok so now we 've built up an introduction and we 're ready for the middle right ? So we 're ready for the middle of the talk which is the meat .,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ232,29.34,29.34,But there 's a problem . And that is that audience have fairly limited attention span .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ234,29.42,29.42,This is an interesting graph so let 's look at a little bit of data . This is a plot of the percentage of a class that 's paying full attention to a lecturer,Graph,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ235,29.42,29.52,over the time during which the lecture is being delivered . Ok there 's some good news right ?,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ236,29.52,29.57,The good news is right here in your introduction people are actually kinda tuned in and listening . And here 's the bad news which is that ok let 's face it,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ237,29.57,30.2,depending on how compelling the lecturer is it might be here or it might be way down there,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,but the bottom line is that at no under no circumstance are you ever going to get,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,100 % audience attention for your entire talk . Why is that ? Well think about being a member of the audience .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ238,30.2,30.2,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ239,30.28,30.5,Why doe this happen ? It 's because we 're human ! We have thought we have thought that intrude on our attention span,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,we have thought about oh my gosh did I remember to load that gel or turn off the power supply,,,,,,,
,,,we have thought about whether we actually are going to be on time getting the kid from daycare,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ240,30.58,30.58,We then a speaker have two choice one is we could say eh ok someone spaced out take no prisoner you spaced out forget it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ241,31.06,31.06,You 're just never going to understand anything else I say . Or we can just acknowledge the fact that the audience is human,Audience,,,,Delivery,,

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ242,31.06,31.13,that every single member of an audience is going to tune out at some point .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ243,31.19,31.19,And we can build in a mechanism within our talk to enable them to catch up .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ244,31.24,31.24,So obviously I kind of recommend the latter . So if the middle is the meat of the talk and it 's the time when the audience is going to zone out at some point,Middle,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ245,31.24,31.33,why ? Because they 're just people ! Well what are we going to do about it ? What I suggest you do is to visualize the middle of the talk in the following way .,Middle,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ246,31.45,31.59,You 're going to have a series of episode or data dive,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,that you 're going to present little story and a you 're presenting a particular story you 're going to start at a level,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,that 's fairly untechnical and you might actually get pretty deep into the data . To a level that 's really going to appeal really just to specialist in your field .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ247,31.59,31.59,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ248,32.07,32.18,Now if we were to give a talk and start presenting our data and we 've all been at seminar where people do this,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,where we just go down into depth and then we just do data data data data data data data data,,,,,Structure,,
,,,and then we conclude and it 's over we 've lost people along the way . So this structure this visual structure here is a way of planning your talk,,,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ249,32.18,32.5,so that you can think about diving down into data and then coming up for air,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and it 's at these transition point between data dive that you use your home image to basically let the audience member,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,catch up and know where you 've just been what you 're concluding from that part of the data,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,and where you 're going to go next . So let 's look at an example of one of those data dive from one of my seminar .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ250,32.5,32.5,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ251,32.57,33.03,You 've already seen the introduction to the seminar you 've already seen how I introduced,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,my home slide . At this point in my talk I 've gone through a review of the literature,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ252,33.03,33.08,the first data dive and I 'm now beginning part two of the talk . And here 's the beginning of that section . So once again you see,Beginning,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Beginning,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Section,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ253,33.08,33.08,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ254,33.08,33.15,this home image and you see the two question . We 're half way through the talk but I 'm summarizing part one,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ255,33.15,33.2,and getting ready to introduce the second set of question . At this point then I now start to explain that a we focus on the blue cell,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ256,33.2,33.33,that we 're going to be looking at the role of a separate protein that is actually expressed in a subset of neuron within the different layer .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ257,33.42,33.49,And then I explain that we 've generated knock mouse in which we 've inserted a reporter into the cell that normally express this protein,Connection,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,so that we can see their axonal connection . And now we do n't really need to focus on the data but look there 's a sentence,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ258,33.49,34.05,at the top that basically say what I just told you then we see a simple figure from the control in which I would point out that what I want the audience to look at,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,are the blue axon that label the connection between the two hemisphere . That 's in the control then we look at the mutant the thing I 'm going to emphasize,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Connection,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ259,34.05,34.13,is the absence of those connection here . Now we 're going to look at it from the side same stuff sentence two simple image,Connection,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ260,34.13,34.2,word will match the content were I really delivering the seminar to you . And then I tell you what I told just told you .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ261,34.2,34.2,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ262,34.28,34.34,I just told you that the blue cell express this protein that they form this type of connection,Connection,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,and then I say you know in the first part of the talk I told you about another pathway .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ263,34.39,34.5,So you might be wondering what is the relationship between these two pathway ? So then I will go on to actually test that connection by presenting more data,Connection,Paralanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,that would then build up into a small conclusion slide showing you that this protein represses the expression of this gene .,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Expression,SpeakerAura,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ264,34.58,35.04,So simple graphic that really emphasize the bottom line,Graphic,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,the story that I 'm telling you with the minimum essential data . Ok so we 've gone through the meat thinking about data dive coming back making transition .,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ265,35.04,35.04,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ266,35.13,35.13,Now let 's think about how to conclude a talk . Here 's the good news is that a you say,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ267,35.13,35.18,and now in conclusion look what happens to the attention level of your audience . It 's like oh it 's over hey I better see what I just saw .,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ268,35.18,35.18,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ269,35.28,35.28,So that 's good news now you 've got one more really good chance to deliver your take to the audience effectively .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ270,35.34,35.46,There 's a danger to this though a well and that 's the danger of hearing,,,,,,,
,,,for example forty minute into a talk someone say `` Oh to conclude '',,,,,,,
,,,and our we 're like `` oh good you know actually they 're ending twenty minute early that 's great I can actually get a little bit more work done today . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ271,35.46,36,So they say in conclusion blah blah blah blah blah blah and then they say `` and now in part two of my talk '' and what 's our response a an audience ?,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,We 're like `` oooh dude no '' . Why is that ? It 's because it wa a false ending . And it got u all excited . So if you 're going to conclude part one of your talk,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ272,36,36,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ273,36,36,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ274,36,36.08,do the audience of favor of saying to some sum up this first part of the seminar and that way you wo n't create a false expectation .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ275,36.16,36.28,But the good news is you will perk up interest a you signal your conclusion and that mean that you have one last chance to really reiterate your specific conclusion,Interest,Impact,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,and most of u remember to do that . But it 's easy to forget to sort of back out to the big picture .,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ276,36.28,36.28,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ277,36.34,36.43,And return to the beginning to have your talk come full circle so that you 're really ending by revisiting the big question,Beginning,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,that you introduced at the very first part of the talk . So again here 's how I would do it in my talk just a a visual,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ278,36.43,36.5,example of how one might think about this . Concluding up now sentence at the top the same diagram that you 've seen before,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ279,36.5,37.04,about this repression and now adding other thing you have n't seen in the data but I would add that just to remind them,Modulation,Prop,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,that at least one of these mechanism work through the modulation of chromatin they would have seen that slide already .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ280,37.1,37.1,I would then connect it back to the first part of the talk and talk about a little switch that had gotten set up .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ281,37.16,37.23,I would then refer back even earlier to a part of the talk that you did n't see now going back to the really big picture,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,question about how different type of neuron emerge over time . Many of these question are still unanswered and therefore represent a frontier in my field .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ282,37.23,37.23,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ283,37.33,37.46,I would then wrap up by acknowledging of course the colleague that have contributed to the work over time,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,and then here 's a trick a you get to the very end of your talk rather than leaving up your acknowledgement slide,Acknowledgement,ClosingComponent,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,have your conclusion slide appear at the very end . For the question and answer period .,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ284,37.46,37.46,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ285,37.51,37.51,Why is that ? Well it help the audience . Remember everything is in service of the audience and I actually have the misfortune,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ286,37.51,37.58,of working on three gene all of which have name that end in two and none of which are memorable by anyone who doe n't work on them .,End,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ287,38.05,38.05,So by putting this picture up I 'm enabling the audience to actually ask intelligent question .,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ288,38.12,38.18,First you know if they 're struggling to remember which gene they had a question about and secondly when I 'm answering a question,Visuals,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,I can actually use the visuals to explain my answer . And that turn out to be very helpful . So I really recommend that at the end of your talk,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ289,38.18,38.18,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ290,38.18,38.26,during Q and A put your summary slide back up again . It 's helpful for you and for the people attending your talk .,Summary,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ291,38.26,38.26,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ292,38.32,38.32,Ok so what have I just told you about organizing a great talk ? First of all use PowerPoint wisely .,PowerPoint,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ293,38.4,38.4,Have very clean minimal slide . Secondly start out with a broad introduction so that everyone in the audience,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ294,38.4,38.55,understands the big question that are compelling in your field and then introduce the specific gradually,Information,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,giving them just enough background information so that they can follow the data but not so much that they 're overwhelmed .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ295,39.01,39.27,Third think of the talk a consisting of these episode or little data dive in which you 're going to go,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,at a point into your data remember the minimum essential data and then you 're going to go into some depth but then you come up for air,Frame,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,and allow the audience to regroup see where you 've just been frame the next question and then get there logically rather than just going through data data data data,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,which wa just going to leave people in the dust . A very effective way of making these transition explicit,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ296,39.27,39.45,is to design a home slide or a home image that is a signal to the audience that you 're at a point of transition,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,and they will perk up and it will help them to understand the flow of your talk . And finally your conclusion here is just the opposite of the introduction .,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Transition,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,Introduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ297,39.45,39.45,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ298,39.53,39.53,You start more specific with what you 've learned but then end up broad again . So is this all you need to know to give a great talk ?,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ299,39.53,40.16,No way ! Right ? I mean these are just some basic rule or suggestion or advice,Slide,VisualAidArtefact,,,VisualAid,,
,,,about how to create slide that are user audience and how to structure your talk so that it 's well organized and very very clear,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,and simple for an audience to follow . But there are a lot of thing that go into giving a great talk .,,,,,Structure,,
,,,,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ300,40.16,40.16,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ301,40.22,40.22,There 's the whole performance aspect of speaking . There 's the actual scientific content,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ302,40.22,40.28,but at least in term of performance you can practice that you can and should rehearse your talk .,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ303,40.36,40.51,In fact the entire time from the first day of graduate school all the way well into being a tenured professor,Comfortable,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,at Stanford I rehearsed every talk every lecture,,,,,,,
,,,every journal club that I gave . Every one of them . And finally I got so comfortable with speaking I do n't actually have to do it anymore .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ304,40.51,40.51,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ305,40.51,40.51,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ306,40.58,41.04,But that mean rehearsing out loud and often in front of an audience dozen and dozen and dozen of talk,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,get feedback and practice the way you 're going to speak . Have the word rehearsed and get some input from your colleague,Feedback,AudienceDesire,Audience,,Delivery,,
,,,,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ307,41.04,41.13,about whether you 've identified effectively the minimum essential data for the talk .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ308,41.18,41.18,Secondly have yourself videotaped . Go and watch yourself and see what you do . See if you 're gesturing naturally and so on .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ309,41.18,41.18,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ310,41.18,41.18,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ311,41.24,41.29,So those kind of aspect of delivery are much more effectively done one on one,,,,,Delivery,,
,,,rather than through a format like this . Another great resource that I highly recommend is a wonderful book by Michael Alley,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ312,41.29,41.37,called The Craft of Scientific Presentations . If you 're going to have just a single book on scientific presentation in your bookshelf I personally would recommend this one .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ313,41.37,41.37,nan,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ314,41.46,41.46,It 's a terrific model and it 's actually the basis of a lot the information that I 've presented to you today .,Model,Prop,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,,,,,,,,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ315,41.51,41.51,Well that 's it ! Thank you so much I hope this ha been helpful and I wish you every success with your talk in the future .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak1,0.01,0.01,Using gesture when give a public speech is a very important part of your presentation .,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak2,0.07,0.18,If you fail to use gesture properly and you do awkward gesture throughout your presentation,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,you are probably going to distract your audience and you are not going to get the impact that,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,you want when you presenting .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Impact,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak3,0.21,0.36,So what are four gesture that we use and how can we use them and use them effectively,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,during our presentation ?,,,,,,,
,,,Hi I am Ryan McLean and I am from publicspeakingpower.com where we teach people like you how to become,,,,,,,
,,,powerful public speaker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak4,0.38,0.44,So I am going to walk you through the four gesture that you can use in your presentation,Walk,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,and so you can become more powerful and effective public speaker .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak5,0.49,1.06,Gesture number one are descriptive Gestures so these are gesture that we are using to,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,describe something or situation .We might draw comparison between something thats,Gestures,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,really big and something thats really small or we might use it to contrast certain item,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,or to depict the size .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak6,1.08,1.19,A great example that I am taking from toy master is if you are using a metaphor something,Metaphor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,is like a tiny little bird and you are holding like cup stand stating the metaphor of the,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,bird and also implying size being small .,Metaphor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak7,1.22,1.31,You can also use descriptive gesture to say shape say it wa the box this big back,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,these and you showing square shape of the box using your gesture .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak8,1.36,1.52,You can also talk about movement so moving from here to there picking up a box you,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,can talk about location the table wa over here and there wa magazine on the table and,,,,,,,
,,,you can even talk about the number like I said four different gesture that we are going,,,,,,,
,,,to use .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak9,1.53,2.09,So descriptive gesture are very helpful because when we are speaking all we have is our word,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,all we have is what come out of our mouth and by using descriptive gesture we can,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,actually improve the impact and improve the comprehension of our audience so that our,Impact,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,message get across more effectively .,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Message,Conclusion,ClosingComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak10,2.13,2.13,Number two is Emphatic gesture that a confusing word so let me explain it .,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak11,2.19,2.25,Emphatic gesture are like emotional gesture so if we are sad we could slump down and talk,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,about thing sad and we are angry we could put our fist together and make angry face .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak12,2.3,3.03,So we can use these gesture to symbolise the feeling that we have and that also emphatic,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,gesture help u in more genuine so what are you talking about I am so angry when,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,this happened and we are using this angry gesture it actually give more humph to our,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,presentation and make sing more genuine yes he were angry I can see his body language,l,a,n,g,e,a,g
,,,he wa angry but if you were saying Yeah I wa really angry and your body language,l,a,n,g,e,a,g
,,,is just slumped and you kind of look depressed well may be they are not going to believe,,,,,,,
,,,that you are actually angry .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak13,3.04,3.04,So actually it give make your presentation look more genuine .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak14,3.09,3.22,Number three a Suggestive gesture so these are the thing like mood an expression,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,for example : you could say I welcome you in with open arm since you got your open palm,Expression,SpeakerAura,,,Delivery,,
,,,symbolises that you are open .,Open,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Open,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,Open,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak15,3.23,3.4,So you could say that this guy in audience who wa just wont listen to anything else,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,or saying he just NO and you are crossing your arm and you kind of you are suggesting,,,,,,,
,,,that even though he may be crossing his arm he wa closed off that wa the vibe that,,,,,,,
,,,he wa giving off the emotion that he wa giving off .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak16,3.44,3.53,You could do lot of other thing like striking your shoulder you know NAHH !,Shoulder,Posture,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,Who care or you could also you know even show your back and when there you just dint,,,,,,,
,,,care about I wa talking about .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak17,3.56,4.06,Last one number four is Prompting Gestures ; So these are the one that prompt the audience,Gestures,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,to do something so what I am going to take Tony Robbins doe this really well he might,,,,,,,
,,,say raise your hand if you want to earn million dollar this year .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak18,4.1,4.15,And so I am raising my hand a I am telling people to raise their hand hence they are,,,,,,,
,,,more likely to do it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak19,4.16,4.16,Or you could say let get warmed up everyone let s jump up and down on the spot .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak20,4.22,4.27,So you can see in the video I am jumping and so it encourages audience or prompt them,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,to do something that you want to do .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak21,4.31,4.37,So they have the four gesture which we can use while giving a presentation and there,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,are some idea on how you can use them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak22,4.4,4.44,When it come down to using them effectively I am going to create an entirely other video,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,and podcast .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak23,4.46,4.52,About that I have got five tip on you can use them more effectively but really it come,Preparation,,,,Delivery,,
,,,down to preparation and practice and being natural in your gesture .,Practice,Preparation,,,Delivery,,
,,,,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak24,4.56,4.56,Dont try and feel force and you dont feel natural then dont do it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak25,5.02,5.1,If it is flowing like it doe in conversation everyday conversation with your friend,HandGesture,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,with your family with your colleague then thats the good sign that theyre going,,,,,,,
,,,to be hand gesture that will work .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak26,5.13,5.19,And also you just you want to avoid those hand gesture that just really take away from,HandGesture,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,your presentation and dont support what you are presenting .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak27,5.23,5.28,So I guess the rule is gesture are supporting what you are saying and then they are probably,Gesture,BodyMotion,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,going to be great .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak28,5.29,5.41,If it take you away from what you are saying like scratching your face adjusting clothes,Clothes,SpeakerAppearance,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,Delivery,,
,,,playing with your ring figure than probably they will take you away from the presentation,,,,,,,
,,,and you dont want to use them .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
1VCaJ4dSHak29,5.43,5.54,For more video audio and article just like this one you can get them on blog hit over,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,

h6sm47j-Am41,0,0.04,I have often heard professional speaker say,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,you should start your presentation with a joke .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am42,0.07,0.09,That attention grabber is critical,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,and I wan na disagree with this advice .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am43,0.12,0.2,I do not recommend telling a setup punchline joke,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,the kind that a stand comic would tell,,,,,,,
,,,and there are a lotta reason why .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am44,0.21,0.32,Now at the same time I am 100 % in favor,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,of using lighthearted humor in a presentation,,,,,,,
,,,and I do it often when I do professional presentation,,,,,,,
,,,and when I teach in college .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am45,0.34,0.37,So there are some difference here,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,but I can give you a really straight ahead way,,,,,,,
,,,to add humor without the big risk of a punchline joke .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am46,0.41,0.41,So let 's take a look .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am47,0.47,0.47,Hi I 'm Alex Lyon and this is Communication Coach .,Communication,Interactivity,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am48,0.5,0.52,We 're here to help you increase your impact,Impact,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,and lead your team to higher level of excellence .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am49,0.56,0.59,Lotta bad advice out there in my humble opinion,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,about telling joke a attention grabber .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am410,1.02,1.02,Here is the most common situation that I have seen .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am411,1.06,1.09,The speaker try to start off with a joke,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,that they have created and then nobody laugh .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am412,1.12,1.18,And then instead of just moving on,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,they start chuckling nervously to cue people,,,,,,,
,,,that that wa a joke .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am413,1.19,1.22,The audience may or may not chuckle nervously,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,and it 's an incredibly awkward situation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am414,1.26,1.32,Now think about this this is the first moment,Nervous,SpeakerEmotion,,,Delivery,,
,,,of your presentation and you completely bombed,,,,,,,
,,,and there are nothing but cricket and nervous laughter .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am415,1.35,1.35,This is not the way you want to start a presentation .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am416,1.38,1.38,It 's really high risk and really low reward .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am417,1.42,1.46,So I am against these stand comic setup,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,and punchline one joke .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am418,1.48,1.5,Now having said that I 'm gon na sound,Sound,Audio,VisualAidArtefact,,VisualAid,,
,,,like I 'm contradicting myself but I am not .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am419,1.53,1.56,There 's a lot of way to add humor,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,to your attention grabber without the big risk .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am420,2,2.05,So let 's look at three easy way to add,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,some lighthearted humor and still grab,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,your audience 's attention .,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am421,2.07,2.1,The first way is to deliberately quote,,,,,,,
,,,someone else that 's funny .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am422,2.12,2.22,Now by quoting them directly by saying a Jerry Seinfeld,Quotation,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,once said or a George Burns once said,,,,,,,
,,,then you may even have the piece of paper in your hand,,,,,,,
,,,and read the quotation .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am423,2.25,2.28,What you 're doing there is you 're drawing,Drawing,Diagram,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,people 's attention to what that other person said,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,and it take the attention off of you a the joke teller .,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am424,2.31,2.31,So you know they have a funny line that kill .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am425,2.34,2.34,It 's already been tested .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am426,2.36,2.37,They 're stand comic they probably worked on it,Stand,BodyPosition,BodyLangugenamebodylanguage,NonVerbalCommunication,Delivery,,
,,,for year to get it just right .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am427,2.39,2.44,And now you 're both you and your audience,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
,,,focusing on that little line,,,,,,,
,,,that little humor a an object that you 're both looking at .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am428,2.47,2.47,So the attention 's not on you .,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am429,2.48,2.55,And if it bomb which they usually do n't,,,,,,,
,,,because if they 're funny they 're funny,,,,,,,
,,,because it 's already been worked out,,,,,,,
,,,then what you do is you get a little chuckle,,,,,,,
,,,you get a little laugh .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am430,2.56,2.56,But if it bomb then it 's not really on you .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am431,2.59,2.59,It 's on George Burns it 's on Jerry Seinfeld .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am432,3.01,3.05,I wa saying to my wife the other day,,,,,,,
,,,you know Jerry Seinfeld said in his bit,,,,,,,
,,, My parent just moved to Florida .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am433,3.08,3.09, Now they did n't wan na move to Florida,,,,,,,
,,, but they 're 65 and that 's the law . '',,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am434,3.09,3.12,And my wife laughed huge .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am435,3.14,3.28,I 'm always trying to make my wife laugh,,,,,,,
,,,but she laugh when I tell Jerry Seinfeld joke,,,,,,,
,,,and I think it 's because you can hear the comedian,,,,,,,
,,,telling the joke in your mind a the person share it,,,,,,,
,,,and it transport you a little bit more,,,,,,,
,,,than hearing me Alex Lyon a the speaker,,,,,,,
,,,tell my one joke .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am436,3.29,3.29,So quote someone else that 's funny .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am437,3.31,3.31,Use a quotation .,Quotation,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am438,3.32,3.32,That 's a great attention grabber no problem .,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am439,3.34,3.36,The other way you can add humor is by telling,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,a lighthearted story .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am440,3.38,3.5,And the way to make a story lighthearted,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,and by the way I have a whole nother video,Video,Film,MovingImage,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,on how to tell story a attention grabber,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,I 'll put that link in the description below,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,is you add a little bit of a goal to the person,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,in the story .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am441,3.51,4.01,They 're trying to reach a destination,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,achieve something and that way your story get humorous,,,,,,,
,,,because the obstacle along the way prevent them,,,,,,,
,,,from reaching that goal and it becomes,,,,,,,
,,,pretty lighthearted pretty funny .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am442,4.02,4.16,That 's the whole reason why a movie like Dumb and Dumber,Reason,ContentIntroduction,OpeningComponent,StructureComponent,Structure,,
,,,is funny because it 's a road trip movie,,,,,,,
,,,where these two guy are trying to get from A to B,,,,,,,
,,,from Providence to Aspen to see about a girl,,,,,,,
,,,and everything that can go wrong doe go wrong,,,,,,,
,,,on their way .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am443,4.16,4.24,And so all these mishap become very humorous,Humorous,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,because you know there 's a goal in mind,,,,,,,
,,,that is preventing and they 're being prevented,,,,,,,
,,,from getting there .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am444,4.24,4.27,So adding a little bit of a humorous goal,Humorous,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,to your story can make that story more lighthearted .,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am445,4.3,4.3,So you can tell a story .,Story,StructureApproach,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am446,4.3,4.35,It 's not a punchline but it add just a little bit,Smile,FacialExpression,Gesture,BodyMotion,Delivery,NonVerbalCommunication,
,,,of a chuckle a little bit of a smile,,,,,,,
,,,to your audience 's experience .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am447,4.37,4.41,And the third way is really easy,,,,,,,
,,,and that is to show something visual,,,,,,,
,,,on the screen that you know is funny .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am448,4.44,4.49,So maybe there 's a cute picture,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAidArtefact,VisualAid,,
,,,maybe there 's a little bit of a joke even on the slide,,,,,,,
,,,and you do n't have to tell it .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am449,4.5,4.52,You just have to say something and then show the image,Image,Picture,Figure,Illustration,VisualAid,,
,,,and people chuckle .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am450,4.53,4.53,You 've probably seen speaker use humor this way .,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am451,4.56,5.02,It 's a very low way because when you were looking,,,,,,,
,,,at the internet or doing your reading,,,,,,,
,,,you came across it and you laughed,,,,,,,
,,,or somebody forward it to you and you laughed .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am452,5.04,5.04,Everybody think it 's funny .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am453,5.05,5.05,Everyone know it 's funny .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am454,5.06,5.08,And so you share it in a presentation and it 's almost,Smile,FacialExpression,Gesture,BodyMotion,Delivery,NonVerbalCommunication,
,,,guaranteed to get a smile .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am455,5.11,5.27,So I am 100 % telling your own setup,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,punchline joke but I am also 100 % in favor,,,,,,,
,,,of using lighthearted humor and these are three,,,,,,,
,,,low way to do it without worrying,,,,,,,
,,,about nobody laughing,,,,,,,
,,,and just hearing those cricket chirping .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am456,5.29,5.29,That 's a really hard way to start a presentation .,Start,StructureComponent,,,Structure,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am457,5.32,5.37,And trust me I 've seen a lotta people crash and burn,,,,,,,
,,,and they just completely fall apart,,,,,,,
,,,because they 're trying to do it that way .,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
h6sm47j-Am458,5.39,5.48,So question of the day what are your suggestion,Humor,RhetoricalDevice,VerbalCommunication,,Delivery,,
,,,for adding humor but not joke to your attention grabber,Attention,,,,PresentationAttribute,,
,,,in your presentation ?,Section,BodyComponent,StructureComponent,,Structure,,
,,,I would love to hear your comment and your question,,,,,,,
,,,in that section below .,,,,,,,

h6sm47j-Am459,5.51,5.54,So thanks god bless and I hope you grab,Audience,,,,Delivery,,
