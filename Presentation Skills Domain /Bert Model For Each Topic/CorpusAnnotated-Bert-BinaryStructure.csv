TmbQFWBvTtY1,0,0.22,  When we stand and present we want to come across a confident and composed .,No
,,,  And one of the great way to do that is by working on our body language . Let 's,
,,,  look at three way to improve your nonverbal body language in presentation .,
,,,  Coming up .,
,,,  Hello again friend . If you never seen one of my video I 'm Alex Lyon .,
,,,  And this channel Communication Coach is here to help you increase,
TmbQFWBvTtY2,0.25,0.43,  your impact so you can lead your team to higher level of excellence . And I,No
,,,  believe that presentation skill are a really important part of leadership .,
,,,  You 're going to be standing and presenting quite frequently if you 're in,
,,,  any kind of leadership position . So we want to get just a little bit better at,
,,,  this . Let 's look at three way you can improve your nonverbal body language so,
,,,  that people can hear your message in a much more confident and composed way .,
TmbQFWBvTtY3,0.47,1.08,  And these tip by the way go together . So each of the three tip have a couple of,No
,,,  piece a you 'll see . So the first tip is eye contact and smile . So eye contact .,
,,,  You have to look directly into somebody 's eye that 's listening about,
,,,  99 % of the time . You do n't want to look too much at your note . You do n't want to,
,,,  look back at your slide really . You certainly do n't want to look at the,
,,,  floor over their head . A lot of bad habit out there in term of eye contact .,
TmbQFWBvTtY4,1.13,1.32,  You want to look directly in someone 's eye almost the whole time and that,No
,,,  really take quite a bit of practice . The other thing you want to do is look,
,,,  directly into somebody 's eye long enough to finish a thought and then move,
,,,  on to the next person . So you do n't want to just stare at one person the whole,
,,,  time and you do n't want to scan so that you 're never locking in . A communication,
,,,  coach actually once told me `` One thought one look . '' So long enough to finish about,
TmbQFWBvTtY5,1.36,1.58,  a sentence feel that connection and then you move on to the next person . So what,No
,,,  do you do with your face while you 're making eye contact . You 've got to,
,,,  smile . A lot of time people get overly robotic when they present . They might be,
,,,  making good eye contact but their face is stern . And it doe n't look like,
,,,  anything 's happening emotionally . You want to smile and warm your face up a,
,,,  little bit so that when you 're making eye contact with somebody they feel a,
TmbQFWBvTtY6,2.02,2.23,  connection with you that 's welcoming and supportive . You do n't want to come across,No
,,,  a a deer in the headlight . Tip number two . Posture and gesture . And these,
,,,  thing go together . So in term of what not to do for posture you do n't,
,,,  want to shuffle your foot back and forth . You do n't want to sway your hip . You,
,,,  do n't want to cross and uncross your leg repetitively . You do n't want to pace,
,,,  around like a wild person . By the way if you want to walk in a presentation it 's,
TmbQFWBvTtY7,2.27,2.48,  okay to walk a little bit but make sure when you walk you stop and you say a,No
,,,  little bit before you walk again . So walk with a purpose,
,,,  stop share your message and then maybe a minute or so later walk again . Do n't pace .,
,,,  So once you have these don'ts out of the way what should you do ? You want to stand,
,,,  with your foot about shoulder width apart . This is how you would stand if you,
,,,  were n't self about how you 're standing . We get self when we,
TmbQFWBvTtY8,2.51,3.12,  present but really all you have to do is stand like a normal person . Then you want,No
,,,  to put just a tiny bit of weight on the front of your foot and a little tiny bit,
,,,  lighter on your heel . And your whole foot is still touching but you have a,
,,,  little bit more of a ready responsive position . You also want to soften your,
,,,  knee a little bit . You do n't want to have locked knee . Bad thing happen when,
,,,  your lock your knee . I 'm not sure of the physiology of it but when people lock,
TmbQFWBvTtY9,3.16,3.34,  their knee they oftentimes pas out when they 're nervous . And you do n't want,No
,,,  to do that in the middle of your presentation . So soften those knee . Now,
,,,  you 've got your posture . Let 's add some gesture to it . You do n't want to put,
,,,  your hand in your pocket . You do n't want to put your hand behind your back .,
,,,  You do n't want to grab on to different part of your body for security . All that,
,,,  look very distracting . So here 's what you should do . You should loosely clasp,
TmbQFWBvTtY10,3.39,3.58,  your hand at about belt level . And then you should just gesture naturally from,No
,,,  there . You do n't want to interlock your finger you do n't want to wring your,
,,,  hand . Because then you 'll get too locked in and it 's hard to let go . But if you,
,,,  practice at home just loosely clasping your hand like this then just start to,
,,,  gesture naturally from here and that 's the way to do it . Small little gesture,
,,,  just like this . You can do this all day long and it 's just going to add a nice,
TmbQFWBvTtY11,4.02,4.24,  emphasis to your word and it 's not going to be distracting whatsoever .,No
,,,  Tip number three . You want to pause . And when you pause after a key idea add a little,
,,,  tiny bit of a nod . I 've seen some really convincing and persuasive speaker do,
,,,  this . And what you 'll notice if you pause after a key idea and nod that pause is,
,,,  really persuasive but the nodding is contagious . You 'll see that people,
,,,  listening to you actually start to nod a little bit with you . And,
TmbQFWBvTtY12,4.27,4.47,  that 's one of the way that you know you have them . It 's a very subtle but,No
,,,  powerful nonverbal body language tip . So those are my three tip for improving,
,,,  your nonverbal body language when you 're presenting . But I 'd like to hear your,
,,,  tip . Question of the day how do you recommend that we improve our body,
,,,  language while we 're presenting . Please put the comment below in that section . I,
,,,  look forward to reading those . So thanks . God bless . I 'll see you in the next video .,
1VCaJ4dSHak1,0.01,0.28,  Using gesture when give a public speech is a very important part of your presentation .,No
,,,  If you fail to use gesture properly and you do awkward gesture throughout your presentation,
,,,  you are probably going to distract your audience and you are not going to get the impact that,
,,,  you want when you presenting .,
,,,  So what are four gesture that we use and how can we use them and use them effectively,
,,,  during our presentation ?,
1VCaJ4dSHak2,0.29,0.54,  Hi I am Ryan McLean and I am from publicspeakingpower.com where we teach people like you how to become,No
,,,  powerful public speaker .,
,,,  So I am going to walk you through the four gesture that you can use in your presentation,
,,,  and so you can become more powerful and effective public speaker .,
,,,  Gesture number one are descriptive Gestures so these are gesture that we are using to,
,,,  describe something or situation .We might draw comparison between something thatƒ??s,
1VCaJ4dSHak3,1,1.22,  really big and something thatƒ??s really small or we might use it to contrast certain item,No
,,,  or to depict the size .,
,,,  A great example that I am taking from toy master is if you are using a metaphor something,
,,,  is like a tiny little bird and you are holding like cup stand stating the metaphor of the,
,,,  bird and also implying size being small .,
,,,  You can also use descriptive gesture to say shape say it wa the box this big back,
1VCaJ4dSHak4,1.31,1.53,  these and you showing square shape of the box using your gesture .,No
,,,  You can also talk about movement so moving from here to there picking up a box you,
,,,  can talk about location the table wa over here and there wa magazine on the table and,
,,,  you can even talk about the number like I said four different gesture that we are going,
,,,  to use .,
,,,  So descriptive gesture are very helpful because when we are speaking all we have is our word,
1VCaJ4dSHak5,1.59,2.25,  all we have is what come out of our mouth and by using descriptive gesture we can,No
,,,  actually improve the impact and improve the comprehension of our audience so that our,
,,,  message get across more effectively .,
,,,  Number two is Emphatic gesture that a confusing word so let me explain it .,
,,,  Emphatic gesture are like emotional gesture so if we are sad we could slump down and talk,
,,,  about thing sad and we are angry we could put our fist together and make angry face .,
1VCaJ4dSHak6,2.3,2.59,  So we can use these gesture to symbolise the feeling that we have and that also emphatic,No
,,,  gesture help u in more genuine ƒ??so what are you talking about I am so angry when,
,,,  this happened and we are using this angry gesture it actually give more humph to our,
,,,  presentation and make sing more genuine yes he were angry I can see his body language,
,,,  he wa angryƒ?? but if you were saying ƒ??Yeah I wa really angryƒ?? and your body language,
,,,  is just slumped and you kind of look depressed well may be they are not going to believe,
1VCaJ4dSHak7,3.03,3.23,  that you are actually angry .,No
,,,  So actually it give make your presentation look more genuine .,
,,,  Number three a Suggestive gesture so these are the thing like mood an expression,
,,,  for example : you could say I welcome you in with open arm since you got your open palm,
,,,  symbolises that you are open .,
,,,  So you could say that this guy in audience who wa just wonƒ??t listen to anything else,
1VCaJ4dSHak8,3.29,3.53,  or saying he just NO and you are crossing your arm and you kind of you are suggesting,No
,,,  that even though he may be crossing his arm he wa closed off that wa the vibe that,
,,,  he wa giving off the emotion that he wa giving off .,
,,,  You could do lot of other thing like striking your shoulder you know NAHH !,
,,,  Who care or you could also you know even show your back and when there you just dint,
,,,  care about I wa talking about .,
1VCaJ4dSHak9,3.56,4.16,  Last one number four is Prompting Gestures ; So these are the one that prompt the audience,No
,,,  to do something so what I am going to take Tony Robbins doe this really well he might,
,,,  say raise your hand if you want to earn million dollar this year .,
,,,  And so I am raising my hand a I am telling people to raise their hand hence they are,
,,,  more likely to do it .,
,,,  Or you could say let get warmed up everyone let s jump up and down on the spot .,
1VCaJ4dSHak10,4.22,4.44,  So you can see in the video I am jumping and so it encourages audience or prompt them,No
,,,  to do something that you want to do .,
,,,  So they have the four gesture which we can use while giving a presentation and there,
,,,  are some idea on how you can use them .,
,,,  When it come down to using them effectively I am going to create an entirely other video,
,,,  and podcast .,
1VCaJ4dSHak11,4.46,5.1,  About that I have got five tip on you can use them more effectively but really it come,No
,,,  down to preparation and practice and being natural in your gesture .,
,,,  Donƒ??t try and feel force and you donƒ??t feel natural then donƒ??t do it .,
,,,  If it is flowing like it doe in conversation everyday conversation with your friend,
,,,  with your family with your colleague then thatƒ??s the good sign that theyƒ??re going,
,,,  to be hand gesture that will work .,
1VCaJ4dSHak13,5.13,5.54,  And also you just you want to avoid those hand gesture that just really take away from,No
,,,  your presentation and donƒ??t support what you are presenting .,
,,,  So I guess the rule is gesture are supporting what you are saying and then they are probably,
,,,  going to be great .,
,,,  If it take you away from what you are saying like scratching your face adjusting clothes,
,,,  playing with your ring figure than probably they will take you away from the presentation,
,,,  and you donƒ??t want to use them .,
,,,  For more video audio and article just like this one you can get them on blog hit over,
,,,  the publicspeckingpower.com and I will see you in next episode where we talk about the,
,,,  five tip for better public speaking gesture .,
h6sm47j-Am41,0,0.17,   I have often heard professional speaker say,Structure
,,,  you should start your presentation with a joke .,
,,,  That attention grabber is critical,
,,,  and I wan na disagree with this advice .,
,,,  I do not recommend telling a setup punchline joke,
,,,  the kind that a stand comic would tell,
h6sm47j-Am42,0.2,0.34,  and there are a lotta reason why .,No
,,,  Now at the same time I am 100 % in favor,
,,,  of using lighthearted humor in a presentation,
,,,  and I do it often when I do professional presentation,
,,,  and when I teach in college .,
,,,  So there are some difference here,
h6sm47j-Am43,0.35,0.5,  but I can give you a really straight ahead way,No
,,,  to add humor without the big risk of a punchline joke .,
,,,  So let 's take a look .,
,,,  ( light music ),
,,,  Hi I 'm Alex Lyon and this is Communication Coach .,
,,,  We 're here to help you increase your impact,
h6sm47j-Am44,0.52,1.09,  and lead your team to higher level of excellence .,No
,,,  Lotta bad advice out there in my humble opinion,
,,,  about telling joke a attention grabber .,
,,,  Here is the most common situation that I have seen .,
,,,  The speaker try to start off with a joke,
,,,  that they have created and then nobody laugh .,
h6sm47j-Am45,1.12,1.26,  And then instead of just moving on,No
,,,  they start chuckling nervously to cue people,
,,,  that that wa a joke .,
,,,  The audience may or may not chuckle nervously,
,,,  and it 's an incredibly awkward situation .,
,,,  Now think about this this is the first moment,
h6sm47j-Am46,1.28,1.46,  of your presentation and you completely bombed,No
,,,  and there are nothing but cricket and nervous laughter .,
,,,  This is not the way you want to start a presentation .,
,,,  It 's really high risk and really low reward .,
,,,  So I am against these stand comic setup,
,,,  and punchline one joke .,
h6sm47j-Am47,1.48,2.02,  Now having said that I 'm gon na sound,No
,,,  like I 'm contradicting myself but I am not .,
,,,  There 's a lot of way to add humor,
,,,  to your attention grabber without the big risk .,
,,,  So let 's look at three easy way to add,
,,,  some lighthearted humor and still grab,
h6sm47j-Am48,2.05,2.19,  your audience 's attention .,No
,,,  The first way is to deliberately quote,
,,,  someone else that 's funny .,
,,,  Now by quoting them directly by saying a Jerry Seinfeld,
,,,  once said or a George Burns once said,
,,,  then you may even have the piece of paper in your hand,
h6sm47j-Am49,2.22,2.34,  and read the quotation .,No
,,,  What you 're doing there is you 're drawing,
,,,  people 's attention to what that other person said,
,,,  and it take the attention off of you a the joke teller .,
,,,  So you know they have a funny line that kill .,
,,,  It 's already been tested .,
h6sm47j-Am410,2.36,2.47,  They 're stand comic they probably worked on it,No
,,,  for year to get it just right .,
,,,  And now you 're both you and your audience,
,,,  focusing on that little line,
,,,  that little humor a an object that you 're both looking at .,
,,,  So the attention 's not on you .,
h6sm47j-Am411,2.48,2.56,  And if it bomb which they usually do n't,No
,,,  because if they 're funny they 're funny,
,,,  because it 's already been worked out,
,,,  then what you do is you get a little chuckle,
,,,  you get a little laugh .,
,,,  But if it bomb then it 's not really on you .,
h6sm47j-Am412,2.59,3.09,  It 's on George Burns it 's on Jerry Seinfeld .,No
,,,  I wa saying to my wife the other day,
,,,  you know Jerry Seinfeld said in his bit,
,,,  `` My parent just moved to Florida .,
,,,  `` Now they did n't wan na move to Florida,
,,,  `` but they 're 65 and that 's the law . '',
h6sm47j-Am413,3.12,3.23,  And my wife laughed huge .,No
,,,  I 'm always trying to make my wife laugh,
,,,  but she laugh when I tell Jerry Seinfeld joke,
,,,  and I think it 's because you can hear the comedian,
,,,  telling the joke in your mind a the person share it,
,,,  and it transport you a little bit more,
h6sm47j-Am414,3.25,3.34,  than hearing me Alex Lyon a the speaker,No
,,,  tell my one joke .,
,,,  So quote someone else that 's funny .,
,,,  Use a quotation .,
,,,  That 's a great attention grabber no problem .,
,,,  The other way you can add humor is by telling,
h6sm47j-Am415,3.36,3.47,  a lighthearted story .,No
,,,  And the way to make a story lighthearted,
,,,  and by the way I have a whole nother video,
,,,  on how to tell story a attention grabber,
,,,  I 'll put that link in the description below,
,,,  is you add a little bit of a goal to the person,
h6sm47j-Am416,3.5,4.01,  in the story .,Structure
,,,  They 're trying to reach a destination,
,,,  achieve something and that way your story get humorous,
,,,  because the obstacle along the way prevent them,
,,,  from reaching that goal and it becomes,
,,,  pretty lighthearted pretty funny .,
h6sm47j-Am417,4.02,4.16,  That 's the whole reason why a movie like Dumb and Dumber,Structure
,,,  is funny because it 's a road trip movie,
,,,  where these two guy are trying to get from A to B,
,,,  from Providence to Aspen to see about a girl,
,,,  and everything that can go wrong doe go wrong,
,,,  on their way .,
h6sm47j-Am418,4.16,4.27,  And so all these mishap become very humorous,Structure
,,,  because you know there 's a goal in mind,
,,,  that is preventing and they 're being prevented,
,,,  from getting there .,
,,,  So adding a little bit of a humorous goal,
,,,  to your story can make that story more lighthearted .,
h6sm47j-Am419,4.3,4.39,  So you can tell a story .,No
,,,  It 's not a punchline but it add just a little bit,
,,,  of a chuckle a little bit of a smile,
,,,  to your audience 's experience .,
,,,  And the third way is really easy,
,,,  and that is to show something visual,
h6sm47j-Am420,4.41,4.52,  on the screen that you know is funny .,No
,,,  So maybe there 's a cute picture,
,,,  maybe there 's a little bit of a joke even on the slide,
,,,  and you do n't have to tell it .,
,,,  You just have to say something and then show the image,
,,,  and people chuckle .,
h6sm47j-Am421,4.53,5.04,  You 've probably seen speaker use humor this way .,No
,,,  It 's a very low way because when you were looking,
,,,  at the internet or doing your reading,
,,,  you came across it and you laughed,
,,,  or somebody forward it to you and you laughed .,
,,,  Everybody think it 's funny .,
h6sm47j-Am422,5.05,5.19,  Everyone know it 's funny .,No
,,,  And so you share it in a presentation and it 's almost,
,,,  guaranteed to get a smile .,
,,,  So I am 100 % telling your own setup,
,,,  punchline joke but I am also 100 % in favor,
,,,  of using lighthearted humor and these are three,
h6sm47j-Am423,5.22,5.35,  low way to do it without worrying,No
,,,  about nobody laughing,
,,,  and just hearing those cricket chirping .,
,,,  That 's a really hard way to start a presentation .,
,,,  And trust me I 've seen a lotta people crash and burn,
,,,  and they just completely fall apart,
h6sm47j-Am425,5.37,5.54,  because they 're trying to do it that way .,Structure
,,,  So question of the day what are your suggestion,
,,,  for adding humor but not joke to your attention grabber,
,,,  in your presentation ?,
,,,  I would love to hear your comment and your question,
,,,  in that section below .,
,,,  So thanks god bless and I hope you grab,
,,,  your audience 's attention really well,
,,,  in your next presentation .,
dEDcc0aCjaA1,0.01,0.14,  `` Hi I 'm Jason Teteak .,No
,,,  I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentation,
,,,  and today I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of,
,,,  your presentation .,
,,,  Here 's how I 'm going to do it . '',
,,,  `` I 'm going to show you 5 step to deliver a killer opener . '',
dEDcc0aCjaA2,0.18,0.38,  If you 're watching this you probably already know that delivering great presentation is,No
,,,  critical to advance your career but did you know that research say that most adult will,
,,,  stop listening to your presentation within the first 10 minute if they are n't convinced,
,,,  there 's something in it for them ?,
,,,  The problem is that most people do n't know about the skill they need to hook their audience,
,,,  give a great presentation and overcome their fear of doing it .,
dEDcc0aCjaA3,0.43,0.53,  What am I going to do ?,No
,,,  Hi Jim .,
,,,  How 's it going ?,
,,,  I 'm freaking out about this big presentation I have to give tomorrow .,
,,,  Well did you write out your opener and practice it three time ?,
,,,  No .,
dEDcc0aCjaA4,0.54,1.09,  No ?,Structure
,,,  Why not ?,
,,,  I 'm terrified and I do n't even know where to start .,
,,,  Trust me I 've been in that situation before and it 's not fun .,
,,,  So to help you out I 'm going to show you my 5 step formula to deliver a killer presentation,
,,,  opener every time .,
dEDcc0aCjaA5,1.1,1.29,  Let 's start off with step number one which is `` Give a Confident Introduction . '',Structure
,,,  One of the biggest mistake people make when they start their presentation is showing nervousness .,
,,,  Here 's the key : It 's not whether you 're nervous it 's whether you show it .,
,,,  The first thing you need to do is stand STILL .,
,,,  Do n't move .,
,,,  Do n't pace and keep your hand at your side .,
dEDcc0aCjaA6,1.33,1.53,  This is the most calm and confident stance on the planet and it handle the number 1,No
,,,  need of your audience which is to feel safe .,
,,,  Now you can introduce yourself and say `` Hi my name is Jason Teteak . '',
,,,  When you do this bring your inflection down at the end to show confidence .,
,,,  Instead of : `` Hi my name is Jason Teteak ? '',
,,,  Say : `` Hi my name is Jason Teteak . '',
dEDcc0aCjaA7,1.56,2.13,  See the difference ?,Structure
,,,  Now we move on to step 2 which is Give Your Credentials .,
,,,  This is where many presenter make the mistake of simply giving their title and year of,
,,,  experience .,
,,,  They say something like `` I 'm a presentation skill coach and I 've been doing it for 20,
,,,  year . '',
dEDcc0aCjaA8,2.14,2.33,  Yet your audience want to know : `` What can you do for me ? '',No
,,,  They need to know who you are why you 're the best person to deliver this presentation,
,,,  and what you have to offer them .,
,,,  For example I might say `` I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver,
,,,  amazing presentation . '',
,,,  What would that look like for you ?,
dEDcc0aCjaA9,2.35,2.52,  To figure this out you need a short elevator speech .,No
,,,  It look like this : `` You know how some people have this problem ?,
,,,  Well I offer this solution . '',
,,,  The solution you offer is how you help people .,
,,,  For me it wa : `` You know how some people have a fear of public speaking and a have,
,,,  hard time getting their message across in a presentation ?,
dEDcc0aCjaA10,2.55,3.16,  Well I help them overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentation . '',No
,,,  What 's your credential statement ?,
,,,  You 'll be amazed at the effect this ha on your audience .,
,,,  Step 3 is to `` Deliver Your Hook . '',
,,,  My hook for this video presentation might look something like this `` I 'm going to show,
,,,  you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of your presentation . '',
dEDcc0aCjaA11,3.21,3.35,  When you do this you have to get your audience to `` feel '' something .,No
,,,  How do you get them to feel ?,
,,,  You have 3 choice .,
,,,  You can get them to feel more happy more successful or more free .,
,,,  Look at my hook .,
,,,  I said `` I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of,
dEDcc0aCjaA12,3.4,3.57,  your presentation . '',No
,,,  When you captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of your presentation you 'll,
,,,  feel happier because they are listening to you you 'll feel more successful because you,
,,,  look like an expert and you 'll feel more freedom when you spend le time worrying,
,,,  about your presentation the night before .,
,,,  Here 's the practical for you .,
dEDcc0aCjaA13,3.58,4.14,  For your presentation write down the word `` I 'm going to show you ... '' then fill in the,Structure
,,,  rest with something that 's going to create more happiness success or freedom for your,
,,,  audience .,
,,,  Here 's the rule .,
,,,  You ca n't tell them WHAT they 're going to get until you 've told them WHY they would,
,,,  want it .,
dEDcc0aCjaA14,4.15,4.37,  Your hook ha to be something that get them to BELIEVE that they want what you 're going,No

,,,  Do n't read the slide .,
,,,  They 're adult .,
,,,  They can read .,
dEDcc0aCjaA16,4.57,5.11,  Instead just give them a moment to read it themselves and introduce your agenda by summarizing,Structure

dEDcc0aCjaA18,5.4,5.57,  to your presentation within the first 10 minute if they are n't convinced there 's something,No

MnIPpUiTcRc1,0.01,0.09,  pay practitioner today I 'm going to be,No
,,,  teaching you with the help of my friend,
,,,  Dana Blouin the top seven tip for a,
,,,  great presentation,
,,,  Dana blue and a an entrepreneur,
,,,  currently living in Bangkok Thailand,
MnIPpUiTcRc2,0.12,0.22,  where he is a co and CEO of a,Structure
,,,  company called mango lab anyways here 's,
,,,  some of his tip we all have to give,
,,,  presentation at different point in our,
,,,  life that might be for school or work or,
,,,  an organization that you were n't,
MnIPpUiTcRc3,0.23,0.32,  involved with no matter where we give,No
,,,  the presentation or to who we want to,
,,,  make sure that it ha the impact on the,
,,,  audience and that it 's memorable these,
,,,  are seven tip that are going to ensure,
,,,  that you nail the presentation and leave,
MnIPpUiTcRc4,0.34,0.43,  a lasting impression on your audience,No
,,,  number one know your audience the first,
,,,  step in preparing for any presentation,
,,,  should be to get a better idea of who,
,,,  your audience is knowing your audience,
,,,  will allow you to understand the type of,
MnIPpUiTcRc5,0.45,0.53,  content they are going to be expecting,Structure
,,,  with regard to depth and technical,
,,,  detail you would n't want to give the,
,,,  same presentation to a group of high,
,,,  school student who are interested in,
,,,  entrepreneurship that you went to a,
MnIPpUiTcRc6,0.54,1.03,  roomful of startup founder and CEOs,Structure
,,,  because their expectation and level of,
,,,  understanding will be on completely,
,,,  different level dig up a much a you,
,,,  can about who your audience is what,
,,,  industry they work in and what,
MnIPpUiTcRc7,1.05,1.13,  position they generally hold this,No
,,,  allows you to really tailor the content,
,,,  and delivery of the presentation in a,
,,,  way that will really make it stand out,
,,,  and be 'rememorable too many time,
,,,  people give killer presentation at one,
MnIPpUiTcRc8,1.15,1.23,  venue to a group made up of their core,No
,,,  audience and then bomb on the same,
,,,  presentation to a different group,
,,,  because they did n't make the change,
,,,  they needed to better address the new,
,,,  audience just because you kill it in one,
MnIPpUiTcRc9,1.25,1.34,  audience doe n't mean the same exact,Structure
,,,  content will replicate the reaction with,
,,,  all audience number two use structure,
,,,  to build on idea if you stand up and,
,,,  give a presentation and all the point,
,,,  you want to make are just tossed around,
MnIPpUiTcRc10,1.36,1.44,  randomly and they do n't make any sense,Structure
,,,  not too many people are going to enjoy,
,,,  your presentation and if they remember,
,,,  it it 's likely that it 's not for the,
,,,  reason that you want them to however if,
,,,  you structure your presentation in a way,
MnIPpUiTcRc11,1.46,1.55,  that each idea each section build on,Structure
,,,  the one before it you help your audience,
,,,  connect with the content and create,
,,,  logical link between the concept this,
,,,  is a great way to make more complex,
,,,  idea easier for the audience to,
MnIPpUiTcRc12,1.56,2.06,  understand and remember,No
,,,  number three use visuals another great,
,,,  tool to cement those idea in the mind,
,,,  of your audience is to use visuals like,
,,,  chart graph and infographics to,
,,,  illustrate and communicate a concept a,
MnIPpUiTcRc13,2.08,2.17,  many a 65 percent of people are,No
,,,  considered to be visual learner so if,
,,,  you do n't take this approach in your,
,,,  presentation you are going to ignore the,
,,,  vast majority of the population using an,
,,,  image regardless of if it 's a picture,
MnIPpUiTcRc14,2.18,2.27,  graph or chart can be a much more potent,No
,,,  conveyor of information and ha a much,
,,,  more powerful impact on the audience a,
,,,  single image can convey so much,
,,,  information just like the old saying,
,,,  that a picture 's worth a thousand word,
MnIPpUiTcRc15,2.29,2.38,  it really is think of the impact this,Structure
,,,  can have when explaining data or result,
,,,  in a presentation if you had to stand,
,,,  there in front of your audience and go,
,,,  through every data point verbally it can,
,,,  get bad quickly and this is much more,
MnIPpUiTcRc16,2.4,2.48,  common of an occurrence than you might,No
,,,  think but if you 're able to visualize,
,,,  that data for your audience with a graph,
,,,  or chart you instantly make it much more,
,,,  understandable and memorable showing,
,,,  someone 200 percent growth with a graph,
MnIPpUiTcRc17,2.49,2.59,  is much more exciting than explaining it,No
,,,  while they 're looking at the raw data,
,,,  for example if I took away the screen of,
,,,  this video and all you saw wa black it,
,,,  would n't be near a exciting number four,
,,,  repetition is your friend having a bit,
MnIPpUiTcRc18,3.01,3.08,  of structure in your presentation go a,Structure
,,,  long way in keeping the audience engaged,
,,,  because they can follow the information,
,,,  from step to step but even more than,
,,,  just structuring the flow of the,
,,,  presentation you also want to build in,
MnIPpUiTcRc19,3.1,3.19,  repetition this encourages people to,Structure
,,,  remember the key point of the,
,,,  presentation and help it stick which,
,,,  again make it and you more memorable a,
,,,  classic way to go about repetition is,
,,,  something Dana learned early on when he,
MnIPpUiTcRc20,3.21,3.3,  started his public speaking career,No
,,,  another speaker at a big regional tech,
,,,  event came up to him after a talk and,
,,,  complimented Dana on is delivery in the,
,,,  depth of the material but asked why he,
,,,  did n't use more repetition Dana wa a,
MnIPpUiTcRc21,3.32,3.38,  bit stumped because he never really,No
,,,  thought about that before the other,
,,,  speaker suggested that Dana start,
,,,  telling the audience what it is he,
,,,  wanted to tell them just to give them a,
,,,  brief rundown of the key point after,
MnIPpUiTcRc22,3.4,3.48,  that move right into the body of the,Structure
,,,  presentation and tell them exactly what,
,,,  wa highlighted at the beginning but,
,,,  obviously with more detail and extra,
,,,  element that you add in to make the,
,,,  presentation stick then in the,
MnIPpUiTcRc23,3.5,3.58,  presentation by telling them what you,Structure
,,,  just told them reminding them of the key,
,,,  point and a brief summary for final,
,,,  repetition using this technique help to,
,,,  reinforce the main point of the,
,,,  presentation at least three time at the,
MnIPpUiTcRc24,4,4.1,  beginning middle and end the key is to,Structure
,,,  find a way to do this that it feel,
,,,  natural and not overly scholastic and,
,,,  that take practice which we 'll talk,
,,,  about later on tip number five have a,
,,,  story to tell,
MnIPpUiTcRc25,4.11,4.19,  the difference between an average,No
,,,  presentation that people zone out of and,
,,,  a great presentation that keep them,
,,,  engaged is how you convey the,
,,,  information to the audience,
,,,  a great way to convey the information or,
MnIPpUiTcRc26,4.2,4.29,  key point of your presentation is to,Structure
,,,  use a story,
,,,  using a story preferably an interesting,
,,,  one you get your point across and you 're,
,,,  creating a moment in the presentation,
,,,  that is memorable and easier for the,
MnIPpUiTcRc27,4.31,4.38,  audience to recall later it 's also,Structure
,,,  hopefully going to be something that,
,,,  catch their attention pulling them in,
,,,  to what you were saying one of the key,
,,,  here though is that it ha to be a story,
,,,  you can tell with commitment and it ha,
MnIPpUiTcRc28,4.4,4.49,  to be true always be honest with your,No
,,,  audience because because if you 're not,
,,,  they will know and you will have lost,
,,,  all credibility tip number six be,
,,,  relatable being relatable is actually,
,,,  one of the most important factor of,
MnIPpUiTcRc29,4.51,5,  your delivery you want to be someone,No
,,,  that your audience can relate to but,
,,,  they would feel comfortable with talking,
,,,  to even when giving a talk a an expert,
,,,  on a topic you want the audience to feel,
,,,  the relation it help them mentally,
MnIPpUiTcRc30,5.02,5.09,  engage with your content and remember,No
,,,  you and your talk,
,,,  most people do n't feel comfortable going,
,,,  up and talking to a stern authority,
,,,  figure and no one want to listen to,
,,,  someone with no confidence so there 's a,
MnIPpUiTcRc31,5.11,5.21,  fine balance you need a strike and,No
,,,  here 's how the most important thing you,
,,,  can do to come across a more relatable,
,,,  is to be authentic be yourself another,
,,,  great way to accomplish this is to work,
,,,  on coming across a relaxed which can be,
MnIPpUiTcRc32,5.23,5.31,  difficult if you 're not used to,No
,,,  presenting but this go a long way to,
,,,  helping people see you a relatable the,
,,,  final way you can be a more relatable is,
,,,  to be enthusiastic about your,
,,,  presentation your enthusiasm will,
MnIPpUiTcRc33,5.33,5.42,  transfer to your audience and now that,No
,,,  you have enthusiasm in common you will,
,,,  begin to see is more relatable if you,
,,,  get all three of these technique,
,,,  mastered you will be well on your way to,
,,,  making it to your audience relate to you,
MnIPpUiTcRc34,5.44,5.54,  tip number seven build your confidence,No
,,,  with practice this might be the last tip,
,,,  but it is by far the most important one,
,,,  out of these seven confidence and what,
,,,  you do is by far the most important,
,,,  element of your presentation having,
MnIPpUiTcRc35,5.56,6.04,  confidence add an authority to,No
,,,  everything you say during your,
,,,  presentation but you 're not going to,
,,,  develop the confidence you need if you,
,,,  do n't practice and practice a lot,
,,,  whatever Dana give a talk or,
MnIPpUiTcRc36,6.05,6.15,  presentation he practice he say for,No
,,,  hour they do n't want to make sure he,
,,,  ha the timing down that he know every,
,,,  slide so he doe n't have to read off,
,,,  them he know what the next slide is so,
,,,  he can smoothly transition between them,
MnIPpUiTcRc37,6.16,6.25,  so that he will sound natural and,No
,,,  authentic and can explain the concept,
,,,  and tell the story with confidence and,
,,,  this all come with practice when you,
,,,  are practicing a presentation it 's not,
,,,  enough to sit in front of your computer,
MnIPpUiTcRc38,6.26,6.35,  and go through it you have to practice,Structure
,,,  it in front of other people invite some,
,,,  friend over and have them give some,
,,,  feedback on your presentation and make,
,,,  improvement based on their feedback no,
,,,  one get it right the first time but,
MnIPpUiTcRc39,6.36,6.44,  practice will,Structure
,,,  get you towards perfect with these seven,
,,,  tip you should be able to put together,
,,,  and deliver a masterful presentation,
,,,  that will wow your audience and make,
,,,  sure that they remember you and your,
MnIPpUiTcRc41,6.45,6.58,  topic if you guy like this,No
,,,  collaboration be sure to check out,
,,,  Dana 's YouTube channel and subscribe he,
,,,  ha ton of video on entrepreneurship,

,,,  thanks so much guy,
gaoxXFju6uo1,0,0.17,  At some point in your life you are going to be called upon to give a speech .,No
,,,  Now this might be at work this might be a best man 's speech at a wedding ; it doe n't,
,,,  matter where because if you ca n't do this without constantly looking down or looking,
,,,  to the PowerPoint to reference your note you are at a huge disadvantage .,
,,,  Not only doe it come across a inauthentic when you 're not communicating to the people,
,,,  eye to eye but if the PowerPoint break which I 've had happen you 're going to find,
gaoxXFju6uo2,0.21,0.36,  yourself standing in front of a room full of people who are waiting for you to speak,No
,,,  and you have nothing to say .,
,,,  So we want to avoid that and today I 'm going to teach you how .,
,,,  The first thing you need to do is to create an outline of your speech that is memory friendly .,
,,,  Now what doe this mean ?,
,,,  The first thing is that it 's chunked in a way that you can remember in your short memory .,
gaoxXFju6uo3,0.41,0.53,  Chunks think of it like this .,No
,,,  If I were to tell you a phone number that 's 10 digit .,
,,,  You 'll probably find that whenever you hear a phone number you 've got to write it down,
,,,  or you got to remember the first half and ask your friend to remember the second half,
,,,  and then you type it into the phone .,
,,,  That 's because there 's 10 chunk .,
gaoxXFju6uo4,0.55,1.15,  That 's too many for most people .,No
,,,  Most people can handle anywhere from 5 to 9 chunk .,
,,,  I play it safe most of my video I had anywhere from 3 to 5 chunk that I have so your first,
,,,  piece is get an outline 3 to 5 bullet point but these point need to in your head feel,
,,,  like they flow clearly from one to another .,
,,,  This piece is very important .,
gaoxXFju6uo5,1.16,1.29,  This is how you avoid memorization .,Structure
,,,  It just kind of flow out of you .,
,,,  So if I 'm doing a piece on conversation I 'm going to do it in chronological order .,
,,,  That make sense to me right ?,
,,,  So the first thing is you approach someone the second thing is what do you say to start,
,,,  the conversation the third thing is what do you do when you run out of thing to say,
gaoxXFju6uo6,1.32,1.43,  and finally how do you say goodbye right ?,Structure
,,,  That make sense to me .,
,,,  If you 're giving a pitch and you 're at a meeting right ?,
,,,  And you 're trying to figure out how to structure thing maybe you think about it from the,
,,,  customer 's perspective .,
,,,  First they 're gon na hit the marketing team then they 're gon na finally meet the sale team .,
gaoxXFju6uo7,1.47,2.06,  And once they get sold they 're gon na go to the deliverable team .,Structure
,,,  Whatever it is the piece should flow naturally in your head .,
,,,  That will save you so much memorization work down the line that 's why I avoid memorizing .,
,,,  The second piece is that once you have these bullet you flush them out .,
,,,  I will actually go in and I type everything that I can think of underneath each bullet .,
,,,  That includes story thing that I want to get detail that I might not have thought of .,
gaoxXFju6uo8,2.09,2.21,  That 's gon na help me communicate my main point .,Structure
,,,  But more importantly this give me a chance to edit the one that I do n't spend time on .,
,,,  You 've seen this before .,
,,,  This is when I rambled .,
,,,  This is when you ramble .,
,,,  So the really key point is to find your detail and then to cut the one that do n't support,
gaoxXFju6uo9,2.27,2.38,  your purpose .,Structure
,,,  It 's not to memorize all these by the way we just want to get it out on paper .,
,,,  That 's the second piece .,
,,,  The third piece is now you 've got a speech written for you right ?,
,,,  It 's got these chunk .,
,,,  It 's got the detail .,
gaoxXFju6uo10,2.39,3.01,  The third thing is to go through it and subvocalize the entire thing referencing your high,No
,,,  bullet point but without visual cue .,
,,,  I realized that last since I had a lot of weird word in it let 's break it down .,
,,,  So first off you want it you 've got your main bullet point but you 're not memorizing this .,
,,,  You 're going through this speech and it 's gon na change a little bit every time  critically important .,
,,,  People who try to memorize word for word they blow it because they get off one word,
gaoxXFju6uo11,3.05,3.21,  and they ca n't get back on the next sentence .,Structure
,,,  We all want to have like these main point that we 're memorizing .,
,,,  When I say subvocalize though that mean that you go through it and just kind of you,
,,,  know whisper to yourself .,
,,,  You go through the whole speech like that .,
,,,  Again not going through it word for word for what you have on there but just hitting,
gaoxXFju6uo12,3.24,3.43,  those main point but most importantly you do this without visual cue .,No
,,,  I ca n't tell you how many people I have seen think that they 're preparing for their speech,
,,,  by reading through it 20 time and then they get up there and there 's nothing they can,
,,,  do but read the speech .,
,,,  Or more common in the corporate world people do n't even realize they 're doing it a they,
,,,  click through a PowerPoint and they do n't realize that they 're taking cue from this,
gaoxXFju6uo13,3.47,4.04,  PowerPoint a they go ; they have n't memorized anything .,No
,,,  So if the PowerPoint go down they 've never had the exercise of actually connecting those,
,,,  piece in their brain .,
,,,  You need to go through it shut your laptop whatever and just kind of talk through it to,
,,,  yourself in your own word the only thing you need to worry about are those main point,
,,,  that should be memorized and should already connect .,
gaoxXFju6uo14,4.07,4.24,  If they do n't connect rewrite the speech so that it make sense and put them in an,No
,,,  order that sequence well and just click for you .,
,,,  You do n't want to be memorizing here .,
,,,  But there are thing that you have to memorize and that brings me to the fourth point .,
,,,  The two thing that I will memorize in just about any video that I do are the first sentence,
,,,  and the last sentence .,
gaoxXFju6uo15,4.27,4.37,  You got to nail the first sentence .,Structure
,,,  Its got to have a hook .,
,,,  You want it to be interesting .,
,,,  Do n't rift it so get your first sentence down word for word .,
,,,  And sometimes I 'll even get the first two or three sentence down because my intro,
,,,  tend to be something that I stick on to these video after I come up with the concept .,
gaoxXFju6uo16,4.41,4.53,  And of course the last sentence ; we 've all been part of a speech where the person did,No
,,,  a good job but at the end they just kind of stood there and like `` ... and that 's the end,
,,,  of my speech .,
,,,  Thank you '' right ?,
,,,  That will blow it .,
,,,  You do n't have to say `` Thank you that 's the end of my speech '' to cue the applause .,
gaoxXFju6uo17,4.57,5.1,  You want to have something that ha a tone a finality .,No
,,,  If you 've watched this channel you know that I do this all the time .,
,,,  This is not a special one it 's just I 'm used to it .,
,,,  I say `` Okay so I hope that you guy have enjoyed this video and I 'm looking forward,
,,,  to seeing you in the next one . '',
,,,  That is how I know that I 'm done .,
gaoxXFju6uo18,5.11,5.27,  It 's how you know that I 'm done .,Structure
,,,  And then of course YouTube tell you that I 'm done when the video stop .,
,,,  But memorize word for word first sentence last sentence that 's going to give you the,
,,,  sort of bumper on either end .,
,,,  And that 's how you can speak for 10 minute at a time without actually having to memorize,
,,,  that much .,
gaoxXFju6uo19,5.28,5.42,  I do it all the time .,No
,,,  I 've just done it right here and I hope that you 've seen the example in it a I 've gone,
,,,  through it .,
,,,  So if you guy have liked this video go ahead now and if you have not done so subscribe to the channel .,
,,,  It 's going to get more tip like this we do public speaking we do conversation how,
,,,  to be your most charismatic self how to be more confident in situation when you 're not,
gaoxXFju6uo20,5.46,6.01,  feeling it ; basically everything that fall under the realm of socializing and personal,No
,,,  development ; that stuff that I 'm interested in and want to help you with .,
,,,  So go ahead and subscribe .,
,,,  You need to get our newest video including Charisma Breakdowns and again these talking,
,,,  head style video .,
,,,  A question for you guy and for a request is that you write in the comment thing that,
gaoxXFju6uo21,6.06,6.2,  you 'd like to see me do .,No
,,,  And this video wa one that I got a lot of question about how do I do these video without cutting .,
,,,  This is how .,
,,,  But it also wa related to another group of question I got which I 'm not sure that I,
,,,  want to cover but I 'm going to throw it back to you guy .,
,,,  People are asking about  there are question about YouTube like you know how do you set,
gaoxXFju6uo22,6.24,6.38,  up the channel ?,No
,,,  What make a good video and what go into it ?,
,,,  And I 've learned a little bit about not only you know the psychology behind it which,
,,,  is my bag but also how to do it at a technical level .,
,,,  So if you 're interested in either of those the psychological piece that might go into,
,,,  making a video that 's shared virally or if you 're just into the technical aspect of it,
gaoxXFju6uo24,6.43,7.06,  let me know .,No
,,,  I do n't want to change the main thrust of this channel but maybe we can have some sort,
,,,  of you know Wednesday video that is related to YouTube .,
,,,  I 'm not forcing it down your throat though .,
,,,  I only want this channel to be something that help the most number of people .,
,,,  So you let me know in the Comments with up vote and comment what you want to see .,
,,,  If it 's something else go ahead and write that too .,
,,,  So thank you guy for that .,
,,,  It 's gon na help me direct the channel and of course I hope that you 've enjoyed this,
,,,  video and I 'm looking forward to seeing you in the next one,
d812a7qG9Kw1,0,0.11,   The way you practice a presentation,No
,,,  directly influence the outcome .,
,,,  So in this video we 're going to talk about,
,,,  how to practice a speech .,
,,,  Let 's get into those detail .,
,,,  ( soft music ),
d812a7qG9Kw2,0.15,0.27,  Hello there friend .,No
,,,  Alex Lyon and we are at the end of a three series,
,,,  on public speaking this month .,
,,,  The first video is on the importance of public speaking .,
,,,  The one before this is on how to improve,
,,,  and this one is specifically on how to practice a speech .,
d812a7qG9Kw3,0.3,0.42,  So let 's get into the five way,No
,,,  that I recommend you practicing a speech,
,,,  and at the end of this video you may wan na stick around,
,,,  because I have a couple of resource to suggest,
,,,  to help you move your public speaking to the next level .,
,,,  So the first way to practice a speech,
d812a7qG9Kw4,0.44,0.59,  is to practice from an outline .,No
,,,  Not word for word note .,
,,,  I 've given some version of this tip,
,,,  in a lot of different video but let 's say it clearly .,
,,,  You must practice from an outline a bare bone outline,
,,,  if you want to sound conversational,
d812a7qG9Kw5,1.01,1.11,  which is really what your listener want from you .,No
,,,  They do n't want you to read your speech,
,,,  they do n't want you to sound like you 've memorized it .,
,,,  They want a conversation .,
,,,  And the way to get there is this .,
,,,  You take whatever note you have to prepare at first,
d812a7qG9Kw6,1.14,1.27,  your first few draft,Structure
,,,  and then you just keep cutting them down over and over again,
,,,  every time you practice,
,,,  until all you 're left with is a bulleted outline,
,,,  of your key point that you are going to hit .,
,,,  That 's all you really want in the end .,
d812a7qG9Kw7,1.29,1.39,  And that way you have a safety net to fall back on,No
,,,  so you wo n't ever lose your place .,
,,,  You can just glance down at your note,
,,,  and then bounce your eye right back up,
,,,  and present from an outline .,
,,,  That 's the best way .,
d812a7qG9Kw8,1.4,1.48,  Practice from an outline,No
,,,  and in the end present like an outline .,
,,,  One of the thing I will do in fact is,
,,,  so I do n't sound like I 've memorized it,
,,,  I do n't sound like a robot,
,,,  is every time I practice,
d812a7qG9Kw9,1.5,2.04,  I might say it a little differently on purpose,No
,,,  so that I 'm not tempted to memorize .,
,,,  So do n't try to put it word for word do n't try to memorize .,
,,,  Talking point only and practice from that kind of outline .,
,,,  The number two tip on how to practice,
,,,  is to spread out your practice session over time .,
d812a7qG9Kw10,2.08,2.2,  Do n't cram the night before .,No
,,,  Do n't cram the morning before your presentation .,
,,,  I recommend spreading your practice session out,
,,,  over three day .,
,,,  The idea is to practice about three time each day,
,,,  over those three day .,
d812a7qG9Kw11,2.21,2.32,  I like to practice about 10 time,No
,,,  before I stand up and speak,
,,,  and it 's really easier to do if you spread it out .,
,,,  A lot of great thing happen,
,,,  when you spread out your practice session .,
,,,  The first thing that happens to me is it calm me down .,
d812a7qG9Kw12,2.35,2.46,  It say to me hey there 's time .,No
,,,  So if my earliest few practice session practice time,
,,,  do n't go so well I say hey there 's time .,
,,,  No problem I got a few more day .,
,,,  I 'll work out these kink .,
,,,  Another great thing that happens is,
d812a7qG9Kw13,2.48,2.56,  let 's say I 've practiced it three time,No
,,,  and then I sleep on it .,
,,,  Oftentimes in the middle of the day,
,,,  I 'm doing other thing I 'm washing dish,
,,,  my brain keep working on it,
,,,  and keep figuring out better way to say something,
d812a7qG9Kw14,2.59,3.1,  or a quicker way to get to the point .,No
,,,  So in that downtime I believe that our brain,
,,,  are still working on it,
,,,  and we benefit from that downtime a well .,
,,,  The other great thing about breaking up,
,,,  your practice session is it help me,
d812a7qG9Kw15,3.12,3.25,  with my composure in the moment .,No
,,,  Because it feel to me like muscle memory with an athlete,
,,,  that I 've done this before .,
,,,  I 've been doing this presentation for day .,
,,,  So it really help me stay composed and in the moment .,
,,,  So spread out those practice session three time a day,
d812a7qG9Kw16,3.28,3.39,  over three day .,Structure
,,,  That usually is about what you need .,
,,,  The number three tip is to focus,
,,,  on only one or two improvement,
,,,  each time you practice it through .,
,,,  So you might just work on your structure and your outline,
d812a7qG9Kw17,3.41,3.53,  in the first few time through that 's normal .,No
,,,  The next few time through just pick one or two thing,
,,,  like oh now I 'm just gon na work on looking up,
,,,  form my outline eye contact for example .,
,,,  The next time through you might just work on gesture,
,,,  and your posture a little bit .,
d812a7qG9Kw18,3.54,4.06,  Every time you practice,No
,,,  add one or two thing you wan na improve on,
,,,  because when you add too many thing all at once,
,,,  when you try to get it perfect every time you practice,
,,,  you 're going to get paralyzed,
,,,  because you ca n't really improve more than one thing,
d812a7qG9Kw19,4.09,4.21,  or maybe two thing in any given practice session,Structure
,,,  so focus on improvement,
,,,  and then start checking those off the list .,
,,,  And then your fundamental will all be in place,
,,,  by the time you actually stand up to present .,
,,,  Number four tip is to keep practice session realistic .,
d812a7qG9Kw20,4.26,4.41,  Do not for example the whole time you 're practicing,Structure
,,,  isolate yourself completely and make condition perfect .,
,,,  Because what end up happening in the moment,
,,,  of your actual presentation is it wo n't go perfectly .,
,,,  People will walk in late,
,,,  or they 'll get up to use the bathroom,
d812a7qG9Kw21,4.43,4.55,  or there 'll be somebody,No
,,,  with a lawn mower outside your window .,
,,,  In fact I 've been recording this morning,
,,,  and there is a neighbor working with a chainsaw nearby,
,,,  that keep distracting me but you just power through it .,
,,,  So after a few time practicing alone,
d812a7qG9Kw22,4.57,5.09,  what I end up doing when I practice,No
,,,  is I add distraction on purpose .,
,,,  Like I will put the television or some music on,
,,,  and then I 'll talk over that,
,,,  because it creates a little bit of noise,
,,,  and distraction for me to cope with,
d812a7qG9Kw23,5.1,5.23,  and I know that if I can practice through those distraction,No
,,,  that during the actual moment I 'll be ready to push through .,
,,,  Even if something weird or odd happens,
,,,  it wo n't throw me off a much .,
,,,  So keep practice session realistic .,
,,,  And the number five tip is to visualize the first 30 second,
d812a7qG9Kw24,5.28,5.4,  and the last 30 second of your presentation .,No
,,,  So by visualization I mean the way a sport athlete doe it .,
,,,  So you picture yourself walking up,
,,,  through that first 30 second of the moment,
,,,  starting off your presentation,
,,,  and then the last 30 second how you 're gon na close .,
d812a7qG9Kw25,5.43,5.55,  So athlete do this with great success .,No
,,,  There is a study by Laure Ecard published in the 1980s,
,,,  and a lot of other study like it,
,,,  on basketball free throw shooting,
,,,  and they found people that only visualized,
,,,  actually did improve a little bit .,
d812a7qG9Kw26,5.57,6.08,  People who practiced free throw basketball free throw,No
,,,  improved a little more .,
,,,  But athlete who did both,
,,,  they visualized and they practiced,
,,,  did the most improvement out of any of the group .,
,,,  So by visualizing the first 30 second and last 30 second,
d812a7qG9Kw27,6.12,6.22,  you 're going to be boosting,No
,,,  your overall performance up quite a bit,
,,,  even if you do n't get to practice it a few extra session .,
,,,  So those are the five tip I recommend,
,,,  in term of how to practice for a speech .,
,,,  These are the one I use personally,
d812a7qG9Kw28,6.24,6.35,  and I have coached a lot of people over the year,No
,,,  to use them and they really do work,
,,,  so put them into practice a soon a possible .,
,,,  So I mentioned a couple of resource at the beginning,
,,,  I wanted to tell you about that are for you .,
,,,  The first one is a free PDF download .,
d812a7qG9Kw29,6.38,6.47,  It 's instant tip to make you a more confident,No
,,,  and composed public speaker .,
,,,  You put your email address in,
,,,  and I email you those instant tip .,
,,,  It 's a PDF download .,
,,,  The second resource is a full course that I have created,
d812a7qG9Kw30,6.5,7.01,  called Present Like a Pro .,Structure
,,,  It 's a whole course and it 's designed to help you become,
,,,  a top 10 % speaker in your professional setting,
,,,  so if you really want to get into it,
,,,  I invite you to check that out .,
,,,  The link to all these resource,
d812a7qG9Kw32,7.03,7.16,  are in the description below the video .,No
,,,  So question of the day how do you recommend practicing,
,,,  your presentation that help you the most ?,
,,,  I would love to hear your thought on what help you,
,,,  in that section below the video .,
,,,  I look forward to reading those comment .,
,,,  So thanks god bless and I will see you soon .,
eRg3Nq2kRug1,0.16,0.3,  whatever the size of your audience a,Structure
,,,  one a small group or even a large,
,,,  scale theatre presentation it 's really,
,,,  important that you 're happy with your,
,,,  environment so often the lectern is in,
,,,  the wrong place or you 're unhappy with,
eRg3Nq2kRug2,0.32,0.43,  where the powerpoint is positioned if,No
,,,  this is the case it 's really important,
,,,  that you fix it before you start the,
,,,  main thing is that you can see your,
,,,  audience and you can be seen by your,
,,,  audience be happy with the sight line,
eRg3Nq2kRug3,0.45,1.03,  and make sure that you can be heard by,No
,,,  everyone in the room the most important,
,,,  thing to remember about power point is,
,,,  that it 's a visual aid it 's there to,
,,,  assist your presentation the,
,,,  presentation should always be about you,
eRg3Nq2kRug4,1.05,1.21,  and not about the slide so remember the,No
,,,  Golden Rule le is more when it come,
,,,  to the physical relationship with the,
,,,  PowerPoint screen keep the body language,
,,,  open create a triangle between your,
,,,  audience yourself and the PowerPoint,
eRg3Nq2kRug5,1.23,1.37,  screen never turn your back on the,No
,,,  audience because this will just,
,,,  disengage them finally it 's really,
,,,  important to remember that we can read,
,,,  quicker than you can speak so do n't,
,,,  generate slide with ream and,
eRg3Nq2kRug6,1.39,1.56,  information that you just read off this,No
,,,  will bore your audience,
,,,  one question that we get asked a lot is,
,,,  about movement during a presentation,
,,,  some people feel that they want to use,
,,,  the space and move around while they 're,
eRg3Nq2kRug7,1.59,2.15,  presenting the rule of thumb is simple,No
,,,  movement work but you have to earn it,
,,,  there 's a big difference between moving,
,,,  at the end of a thought at the end of a,
,,,  paragraph and changing position which,
,,,  help to signpost to the audience that,
eRg3Nq2kRug8,2.17,2.37,  there 's a gear shift in what you 're,No
,,,  saying a movement which is just nervous,
,,,  pacing this nervous pacing movement will,
,,,  detract your audience away from the,
,,,  clarity of your message all too often,
,,,  people start a presentation and from,
eRg3Nq2kRug9,2.4,2.58,  beginning to end they barely draw breath,Structure
,,,  the full stop is a crucial tool for good,
,,,  presentation not only doe the full stop,
,,,  allow you to take a breath but more,
,,,  importantly it give your audience a,
,,,  chance to catch up to absorb the,
eRg3Nq2kRug10,3.01,3.15,  information that you 've just given them,No
,,,  remember any presentation is a journey,
,,,  we need to give our audience information,
,,,  and allow them to absorb it give them,
,,,  the next piece of information and allow,
,,,  them to absorb it that moment of,
eRg3Nq2kRug11,3.17,3.36,  absorption is what happens at the full,No
,,,  stop so use it wisely,
,,,  if you 're not passionate and interested,
,,,  in what you 're talking about how can you,
,,,  ever expect your audience to be so often,
,,,  especially in British business we,
eRg3Nq2kRug13,3.39,3.56,  believe we have to be matter of fact in,No
,,,  order to be credible actually research,
,,,  show the opposite is true the more,
,,,  passion that we are about our subject,
,,,  matter the more engaged our audience,
,,,  become and most importantly the more,
,,,  they remember,
6A3qofuTUGQ1,0,0.13,  Hi Guys,No
,,,  ( reading note ) My name is Lisa and today I ? m going to be talking about the issue of teenage binge drinking .,
,,,  So hey guy,
,,,  ( too casual ) You guy obviously know me and I obviously know you .,
,,,  Sooo today my topic is going to be about teenage binge drinking,
6A3qofuTUGQ2,0.18,0.28,  Hey everyone .,No
,,,  ( closed arm ) Today I ? m going to be talking about teenage binge drinking,
,,,  Hey everyone .,
,,,  ( speaks very quickly ) Today I ? m going to be talking about the issue of teenage binge drinking,
,,,  giggle sorry guy I kind of forgot my next sentence .,
,,,  cricket chirping,
6A3qofuTUGQ3,0.29,0.43,  ORAL PRESENTATIONS  The Basics,Structure
,,,  1 START OFF WITH A BANG,
,,,  The first thing to remember is to PLEASE start off in an interesting way .,
,,,  No more of this :,
,,,  So unoriginal ? Good Afternoon everyone a you may know my name is Lisa today I ? m,
,,,  going to be talking about binge drinking ?,
6A3qofuTUGQ4,0.45,1,  So cliche .,Structure
,,,  So Boring ? Hi my name is Lisa and today I ? m going to be talking about binge drinking ?,
,,,  Try to start off a little bit more like this :,
,,,  a ) How would you feel if you were stuck inside a cage 24/7 left inside a dungeon where,
,,,  it ? s completely dark and there ? s just no way of escaping ?,
,,,  This is exactly what it ? s like for caged chicken .,
6A3qofuTUGQ5,1.03,1.2,  b ) Let me guess everyday before school you have a certain routine .,No
,,,  You wake up you brush your teeth you put your uniform on have breakfast and you ? re,
,,,  ready to go .,
,,,  You catch the train and then you ? re at school .,
,,,  But what if the train is sort of crowded that you end up not being able to catch the,
,,,  train in time not making it to school in time and missing out on that assessment that,
6A3qofuTUGQ6,1.25,1.37,  you have first thing in the morning .,Structure
,,,  Today I ? m going to be talking about the importance of adding more train to our public,
,,,  system .,
,,,  ( Originality is key ),
,,,  Whether it ? s just starting off with rhetorical question an anecdote or a scenario of some,
,,,  sort please just try to get creative and get your audience ? s attention immediately .,
6A3qofuTUGQ7,1.42,1.55,  You ? ve only got one chance to get this right .,No
,,,  So you might a well start it off with a BANG !,
,,,  2 BODY LANGUAGE,
,,,  Don ? t cross your arm because that mean that you ? re shut off from your audience,
,,,  and that you ? re not ready to engage with them and to welcome them into your topic .,
,,,  Feel free to use your arm  not too much but try to keep yourself relaxed keep your,
6A3qofuTUGQ8,2,2.17,  body relaxed so that you ? ll move naturally .,No
,,,  Look interested in your topic a well it should be something that you ? re passionate,
,,,  about .. so if you look disinterested then what ? s the point of anyone else being interested,
,,,  in what your topic is about .,
,,,  Make sure that your expression fit the topic so if it ? s going to be something upsetting,
,,,  if it ? s something devastating emerge your emotion with that .,
6A3qofuTUGQ9,2.2,2.27,  Get in tuen with what your topic about .,No
,,,  3 NO AWKWARD BREAK,
,,,  If you get stuck don ? t stop .,
,,,  Don ? t be like? .,
,,,  eye wandering around ...,
,,,  Um? giggle ......,
6A3qofuTUGQ10,2.29,2.44,  Geez what wa it,No
,,,  But just stand there recollect your thought and then go again .,
,,,  It might feel like eternity but at the very least you ? re not filling in your oral with,
,,,  random word that just don ? t contribute to anything .,
,,,  And it also disengages the audience too .,
,,,  ? And so a I wa mentioning before the statistic are so high that one of? ?,
6A3qofuTUGQ11,2.5,3.01,  4 PRACTICE,No
,,,  One of the thing that people don ? t do enough of is practice their oral .,
,,,  They get held up in writing the actual oral and they get stressed out on the actual day .,
,,,  But what about practicing beforehand ?,
,,,  You need to make sure that your speed is on point .,
,,,  Just remember that you ? ll probably be nervous .,
6A3qofuTUGQ12,3.03,3.17,  So you ? re going to be speaking a little bit faster than you normally would be .,No
,,,  Make sure you memorize the speech a much a possible .,
,,,  Memorizing a speech mean that you can then shift away from just looking at your paper,
,,,  and that you can start focusing on actually targeting the audience that ? s in front of,
,,,  you .,
,,,  The more you can engage with them the better it will be for you .,
6A3qofuTUGQ13,3.19,3.32,  And the more confidence you will have .,No
,,,  Okay guy I hope you enjoyed this video .,
,,,  I wanted to do something a little different .,
,,,  Especially with oral presentation it ? s all about the performance so I kind of wanted,
,,,  to tap into that a little bit .,
,,,  I know that some of the point that I ? ve addressed here today seem really obvious  but,
6A3qofuTUGQ14,3.36,3.55,  despite the fact that it ? s obvious there ? s still a reason why this stuff happens .,Structure
,,,  And you still see it every single year and I ? m sure you know exactly what I mean .,
,,,  There ? s always that one classmate that doe the big no or that one classmate that ? s,
,,,  you know  talking like this talk behind paper .,
,,,  Whatever it is hopefully if you ? re one of these people what you learned from today,
,,,  or what ha been reiterated into your head for today Start applying that into your oral .,
6A3qofuTUGQ15,4.01,4.21,  If you guy like this video please give it a thumb up because that will let me know,No
,,,  that you guy are more interested in deeper oral presentation topic .,
,,,  So whether that is structuring an argument or how to present in front of different audience,
,,,  I know some school do it in front of the classroom but other school just do it in,
,,,  front of teacher or small group of student or how to formulate argument to be more persuasive .,
,,,  So if you actually needed some help with what topic you should do for this year ? s oral,
6A3qofuTUGQ16,4.26,4.43,  presentation if you haven ? t decided already I ? ve actually compiled a list of about close,No
,,,  to 20 oral topic potentially you could choose .,
,,,  They ? re pretty much the best one that are out there at the moment so definitely check,
,,,  out the description box below and you will find a link to the blog post for that where,
,,,  you can also download a PDF .,
,,,  Best of luck for your oral .,
6A3qofuTUGQ18,4.44,5.16,  I ? m sure you guy are going to do absolutely fine .,No
,,,  Just remember at the end of the day even if you have no idea what you ? re talking,
,,,  about .,
,,,  Confidence is key .,
,,,  I could be talking about nonsense right now and talking about God know what and yadi,
,,,  yadi yah but because I ? m making eye contact because my tone is reassuring you will most,
,,,  likely believe it .,
,,,  Okay so yeah I ? ll see you guy next time .,
,,,  BYEE,
eHhqWbI0y4M1,0.01,0.34,  Do you have to make presentation ?,No
,,,  Do you hate presentation ? I like presentation,
,,,  but one thing that you are probably maybe good at with presentation are making PowerPoint,
,,,  presentation because you have visual aid to help you so you do n't really have to talk,
,,,  a much if you 're nervous about talking . Presentation skill is something that you,
,,,  can work on . We have video on www.engvid.com to help you with presentation skill . So,
eHhqWbI0y4M2,0.42,1.2,  go and check those out for learning how to speak during presentation .,No
,,,  But what we 're going to focus on today is the visual aspect of presentation so your,
,,,  PowerPoint thing . Some thing to do and some thing not to do . So here we are presentation,
,,,  skill . The first thing and one of the thing that make these presentation so fun are,
,,,  picture . But we have to be careful . The template that you have already included in your presentation,
,,,  software they 're boring . People use them all the time . So I suggest you try and download,
eHhqWbI0y4M3,1.28,2,  some other picture to make your presentation more interesting . And with that make sure,No
,,,  that on one slide you have one image . Make it interesting .,
,,,  Do not have a split screen . So do n't have two image on one slide . Do not have a collage,
,,,  that 's insane . A collage is many different small picture on one screen . Even when I,
,,,  see a collage there 's a lot of collage coming out on Facebook now and I 'm like :,
,,,  `` Too many picture . Ca n't understand . '' Our brain just can not comprehend all those picture especially,
eHhqWbI0y4M4,2.07,2.36,  when you 're having the slide up for a short period of time . Do n't make it like a photo,No
,,,  album . Do n't put million and seven picture and ... Keep it simple . Put a single image,
,,,  on each slide . Try and pick image that you actually like and not too distracting . You,
,,,  do n't want puppy dog and thing . Make something simple but something that you like and make,
,,,  sure it look nice .,
,,,  The next one you have to worry about is the lettering . So the lettering you also might,
eHhqWbI0y4M5,2.41,3.19,  know this a the font . So font and lettering are the same . One thing that you do not want,No
,,,  to do is have really fancy or beautiful lettering . Simply ... The reason is some people ca n't,
,,,  read when the letter are fancy especially if you are doing presentation for people,
,,,  whose ... Do not have English a their first language if you take the letter and you,
,,,  write them even cursive a lot of people have problem reading cursive . So I suggest you,
,,,  use something more traditional . There 's lot of very easy font you can get from,
eHhqWbI0y4M6,3.26,3.58,  your ... Whatever word processing you use . So make it simple easy to read .,No
,,,  Another problem that you might have is the script is too big or too small . So remember,
,,,  that when you 're making your presentation you 're doing it probably on your laptop or,
,,,  your desktop or your iPad or your phone so the font or the lettering is going to be,
,,,  different than when you put it up on the projector . So if at all possible if you can check it,
,,,  out before you do the presentation . Look at your ... Hook up your laptop or whatever and,
eHhqWbI0y4M7,4.04,4.38,  see if you can actually see it on the screen because the font is different . You might think,No
,,,  that on your laptop it 's a good size but when it get on the projection screen it 's,
,,,  tiny ; or it take up too much space and it 's too big .,
,,,  Next up are the word or the text . So there 's been study done on how many line of text,
,,,  a human can absorb or understand and any more than six you 've lost the people . So,
,,,  try and keep on each slide one very simple image with very traditional clear text and,
eHhqWbI0y4M8,4.47,5.2,  put only two or three line on each slide . Do n't put bullet point . If you have more,No
,,,  than six line or if you have bullet point again we just ... We just ca n't remember them,
,,,  all . We just lose focus . We have something called too much information too much info,
,,,  TMI . `` Too much information '' mean that if you have more than two or three line we 're,
,,,  just not getting it . Our brain ca n't ... We just ca n't learn it like you want u to .,
,,,  The other one that 's probably really important is the colour that you use . Now it 's fun,
eHhqWbI0y4M9,5.26,5.58,  to have different colour it help u ... As you can see on the board it help u create,No
,,,  contrast and highlight word or thing you think that are important but if you have,
,,,  different colour within one word ... Can you read this word ? It make it really really,
,,,  difficult to read . This word say `` different '' and maybe when you 're watching the video at,
,,,  home you ca n't maybe see the `` i '' or the `` e '' . This look very childish . When we 're kid,
,,,  we can make different colour and it 's fun but your presentation is n't for child .,
eHhqWbI0y4M10,6.02,6.26,  It 's not meant to be fun . You want to have the title and the word very easy to read .,No
,,,  You do n't want them to be difficult and you do n't want to have people straining their,
,,,  eye to figure out what word that is .,
,,,  I will never forget my grade 4 art teacher telling me that you can never use different,
,,,  colour in one word . As an 8 year old I wa just taken back . I wa like :,
,,,  `` Oh my god I use different colour all the time Mr . Riley . '' No . So I remember this . Thank you Mr. Riley,
eHhqWbI0y4M11,6.33,7.03,  if you 're still out there for teaching me this very important lesson .,No
,,,  But what you can do is you can definitely use different colour one different colour,
,,,  to highlight or emphasize one word . So down here you can use one different colour to,
,,,  emphasize important word . So a you can see I want you to focus on the word `` one '' and,
,,,  emphasize . The other word I 'm keeping black . So one different colour will really help this,
,,,  pop out or stand out . If you use too many colour again get confused . So ...,
eHhqWbI0y4M12,7.14,7.43,  I 'm dying . Someone get me an Alka .,No
,,,  The last thing is you want a strong contrast of the letter and the background . So if,
,,,  my background colour is blue I would n't want to have green lettering because green and,
,,,  blue are very similar colour very similar shade so you have to make sure that if your ...,
,,,  If you have a grey background you want something that really stand out . You have to be careful,
,,,  of the colour that you choose for the background and the lettering .,
eHhqWbI0y4M14,7.47,8.35,  So if you can keep these four major category in mind when you 're doing or making a presentation ...,No
,,,  Colour keep it simple . One or two different colour is fantastic .,
,,,  Make sure the word or the text are limited to two or three major point .,
,,,  You want to build your presentation instead of just throwing information at people .,
,,,  Make sure the lettering is clear nothing crazy .,
,,,  Make sure it 's not too big not too small . And also make sure that you 're not,
,,,  overloading the people with picture because it 's going to lose from your actual presentation point .,

41ZBTgYSl0c1,0,0.27,  Have you ever wondered how those great speaker that you love to listen to have,No
,,,  a conversational approach to their delivery ? We 're going to teach you how to,
,,,  have what 's called an extemporaneous delivery style coming up .,
,,,  Hello friend . I 'm Alex Lyon and Communication Coach this channel is here,
,,,  to help you increase your impact and lead your team to higher level of,
,,,  excellence . One of the way you can do that is through better presentation,
41ZBTgYSl0c2,0.32,0.56,  skill . Today we 're going to unpack how to speak extemporaneously . In other word,No
,,,  conversationally . Let 's put it this way . Nobody want to hear you give a,
,,,  memorized presentation . Nobody want to listen to you read a presentation word,
,,,  for word . And here 's how I know this . Do you want to listen to someone read a,
,,,  presentation word for word ? Do you want to listen to someone like a robot give,
,,,  you a memorized word presentation . Nobody like it and unless,
41ZBTgYSl0c3,1,1.25,  you 're President of the United States and you 're using teleprompter you,No
,,,  probably wo n't ever be asked to do this in a professional setting . Almost,
,,,  everybody across the board that 's at that high level of speaking us what we,
,,,  call extemporaneous delivery style . And that mean when you know the material so,
,,,  that you could speak conversationally with limited note in a structured way .,
,,,  Now it sound pretty basic and you appreciate it when you see it but it,
41ZBTgYSl0c4,1.3,1.52,  actually take quite a bit of work to get there . But once you know how to do it,Structure
,,,  this way I doubt you 'll ever want to go back to reading your note word for word,
,,,  again . So first let 's talk about how to do this . The first tip is that you have,
,,,  to commit to a structure . The structure is the backbone of the whole,
,,,  presentation that help you keep your place and help you move forward,
,,,  according to your plan . You 're going to need a really clear introduction body,
41ZBTgYSl0c5,1.56,2.13,  and conclusion . And within each of those section in you 're introduction for,Structure
,,,  example you 're going to have certain part that you hit . Four part in your introduction .,
,,,  You 're going to know your clear two or three or four main point you 're going,
,,,  to hit with nice transition and information in each of those bucket . And,
,,,  you 're going to have a really clear conclusion . You 're going to know how you,
,,,  end . So you have to have a clear structure . If you do n't have a clear,
41ZBTgYSl0c6,2.17,2.4,  structure it 's going to be very difficult to get comfortable enough to,Structure
,,,  have a conversational style . The second tip is that you 're going to have to,
,,,  practice probably more than you realize . I recommend practicing a,
,,,  presentation about ten time . Now that might seem like a lot . However over the,
,,,  year I 've been doing coaching and teaching college for about 20 year in,
,,,  professional setting it 's really no different if you only practice two to,
41ZBTgYSl0c7,2.44,3.05,  three time you 're just not going to do that well that 's not enough repetition,No
,,,  to get completely comfortable with a topic completely comfortable expressing,
,,,  yourself and connecting while you 're sharing information . Time and time again,
,,,  when I pull really skilled speaker aside I say about how many time did you,
,,,  practice ? the number ten come up a lot . Some people that are exceptionally,
,,,  gifted might only practice eight or so time . Most people 10 or even more . So,
41ZBTgYSl0c8,3.09,3.37,  practice about ten time . Now the way you practice ten time becomes really,No
,,,  critical if you want to speak conversationally . Let 's say the first,
,,,  time you practice you use a full set of note . Now the number one killer is too,
,,,  many note and so you want to pare down your note to the bare minimum that you,
,,,  need to give that presentation . So you start off the first and you let 's say,
,,,  you 're practicing ten time the first two or three time you practice you have,
41ZBTgYSl0c9,3.39,3.59,  your full set of note . The more you practice the more you should try to get,No
,,,  away from that look up a little more often so that in the next two to three,
,,,  time you practice I recommend cutting those note about in half . So maybe you,
,,,  have let 's say you start off with four page of note cut it down to about two,
,,,  page of note . And instead of full sentence you want to pare it down to,
,,,  maybe half sentence and then you practice it another two or three time .,
41ZBTgYSl0c10,4.02,4.26,  And then the last two or three time you practice you should be all the way down,Structure
,,,  to very simple bullet talking point that are just maybe even a single word,
,,,  or a short phrase . And the goal here is that a you 're practicing that eighth,
,,,  ninth or tenth time all you have to do is look at your note just for a moment,
,,,  and you see maybe even one keyword maybe it just say Hawaii and you know you 're,
,,,  going to tell a story about Hawaii that last about 30 second . So now,
41ZBTgYSl0c11,4.31,4.56,  there 's no reason to really look at your note beyond glancing down seeing the,No
,,,  word and putting your eye back up on your listener and,
,,,  connecting with them conversationally in that story about Hawaii . So you want to,
,,,  pare your note way back and practice that way . So the next tip is each time,
,,,  you practice it say it in a variety of way . In other word do n't get locked in,
,,,  to using the exact same sentence the exact same phrase each time you present .,
41ZBTgYSl0c12,5.01,5.22,  I even sometimes deliberately will say thing differently each time I do it,No
,,,  because it give me another way to express it . In fact a telltale sign for,
,,,  me when I 'm watching a speaker and I can tell they 're just memorizing this word,
,,,  for word is they might start a sentence a certain way and then not remember how,
,,,  to finish it and so they 'll go back and they 'll start it over again a little,
,,,  differently so they can land at the end of sentence the way they originally,
41ZBTgYSl0c13,5.25,5.48,  practiced it . That 's going to start to sound very robotic . You want to say,No
,,,  thing in a many way a possible when you 're practicing so that in the moment,
,,,  no matter what happens you can move ahead in that presentation smoothly and,
,,,  still maintain that nice conversational approach . So practice it in a variety of,
,,,  way . The other thing you want to do is keep your practice session realistic .,
,,,  Keep some real world . So for example I like to even though I 'm alone when I 'm,
41ZBTgYSl0c14,5.54,6.14,  practicing oftentimes I like to look up away from my note while I 'm practicing,No
,,,  because it 's a good habit to get into to look up . So if I practice only looking,
,,,  at my note well that 's a habit I 'm engraining so that when I go to my actual,
,,,  presentation I 'm going to have a habit of looking at my note . So you want to,
,,,  practice by looking up sometimes . In fact I know a good friend of mine,
,,,  actually set up stuffed animal and even put pillow inside of winter coat and,
41ZBTgYSl0c15,6.18,6.37,  put face and paper on top of them and then when they were practicing that,No
,,,  presentation they were looking at their stuffed animal and looking at those,
,,,  dummy they made . And during the presentation it wa much easier because they,
,,,  practice that way to connect because they made their practicing realistic . Now,
,,,  obviously they 're not real people but maybe you have a roommate or even a dog,
,,,  that you can present to to keep it real . Once you 're really comfortable and,
41ZBTgYSl0c16,6.42,7.04,  you 've kept it real sometimes people will even add distraction so they might,No
,,,  turn the television on in the background are some music on in the background or,
,,,  do it in a somewhat public area . You might look a little crazy but if you can,
,,,  present conversationally and get through your outline in a nice extemporaneous,
,,,  fashion even with distraction then you 're much more likely to speak,
,,,  conversationally in the moment . You never know for example when there 's going to be,
41ZBTgYSl0c17,7.08,7.29,  someone outside with a jackhammer someone outside with a lawn mower . Someone 's,No
,,,  going to come in late . Someone 's going to leave early . In the moment every little,
,,,  every little distraction can really heighten your nervousness and throw,
,,,  you off if you 're not prepared for it . So the benefit of it speaking,
,,,  extemporaneously can not be underestimated . First of all audience,
,,,  prefer this style of delivery from the presenter far and away . Nobody want to,
41ZBTgYSl0c18,7.34,7.56,  hear you memorize or or read your presentation . Believe me you do n't want,No
,,,  to do it anymore and then you want to listen to it . And this is a skill that,
,,,  you can build on if you can break the habit get away from that safety net all,
,,,  those note extemporaneous delivery that conversational approach is a really,
,,,  great skill to build on . You can use it in all kind of professional setting .,
,,,  You 're going to bring it with you for the rest of your life . So I highly,
41ZBTgYSl0c19,7.59,8.2,  recommend you take the plunge pare those note down to the bare minimum and start,Structure
,,,  practicing in a realistic way . The question of the day what are your tip,
,,,  for conversational delivery for making thing much more extemporaneous . I would,
,,,  love to hear your comment in that section below . So thanks . God bless . And I,
,,,  hope that you speak more conversationally in your very next,
,,,  presentation .,
wVcxAhbeMWc1,0.03,0.13,  a you think about your upcoming,No
,,,  communication setting whether you 're,
,,,  going to be speaking to one or two,
,,,  people at a table because you might be,
,,,  selling them insurance or you may be,
,,,  speaking to a large audience or maybe,
wVcxAhbeMWc2,0.16,0.29,  it 's a staff meeting or a meeting with,Structure
,,,  potential client or perhaps even a,
,,,  general audience you want to consider,
,,,  the power of using image and analogy,
,,,  to communicate any complex concept the,
,,,  way the human brain work is that we,
wVcxAhbeMWc3,0.31,0.42,  have a tendency to remember image and,No
,,,  emotion that feeling that vision more,
,,,  than we will remember fact and figure,
,,,  so having that analogy give your,
,,,  audience something to hold on to and,
,,,  remember let 's take a look at four,
wVcxAhbeMWc4,0.45,0.57,  example of great analogy if for,No
,,,  example you 're in the financial world,
,,,  and you 're explaining the concept of,
,,,  compound interest for you it may be very,
,,,  easy to understand but for someone who 's,
,,,  not familiar with the concept it 's hard,
wVcxAhbeMWc5,0.59,1.14,  to wrap their brain around it so one,No
,,,  great analogy I heard is a financial,
,,,  advisor said compound interest work the,
,,,  way snowball work if you take a small,
,,,  amount of snow and you start to roll it,
,,,  it increase in size the diameter grows,
wVcxAhbeMWc6,1.16,1.29,  and every time you roll it that snowball,Structure
,,,  grows exponentially and that 's the way,
,,,  compound interest work every roll,
,,,  creates a great increase in an even,
,,,  greater increase so over time something,
,,,  quite small can become quite something,
wVcxAhbeMWc7,1.31,1.44,  quite large that 's the first analogy,No
,,,  here 's another one also from the,
,,,  financial world someone who once,
,,,  explained the way stock work the way a,
,,,  rubber ball bouncing work now it 's not,
,,,  always true but it 's a great image to,
wVcxAhbeMWc8,1.46,1.57,  hold on to so he said to me think about,No
,,,  the way a bouncing rubber ball go high,
,,,  into the air you bounce on the ground to,
,,,  go shooting up in the air quite quickly,
,,,  at the start and then it begin to slow,
,,,  down just before it make the turn and,
wVcxAhbeMWc9,2.01,2.14,  after the turn it drop like a stone,No
,,,  so he 'd want me to watch out for fast,
,,,  rising stock because they will shoot up,
,,,  and they will start to slow,
,,,  he turned and he said in that slowing,
,,,  down point is when you want to pay,
wVcxAhbeMWc10,2.16,2.25,  attention because a lot of people make,No
,,,  the mistake of a holding on to the stock,
,,,  at the top thinking well maybe it 's,
,,,  gon na shoot up again but he said that 's,
,,,  very rare it happens but it 's rare and,
,,,  often a they 're slowing down that is,
wVcxAhbeMWc11,2.27,2.37,  the moment but they 're about to drop,Structure
,,,  like a stone and that 's the moment you,
,,,  want to get out again not always the,
,,,  case but a great image a great analogy,
,,,  for someone like me for someone like you,
,,,  to hold on to so think about a complex,
wVcxAhbeMWc12,2.4,2.52,  concept that you have that you take for,Structure
,,,  granted that you understand anything how,
,,,  can I create this in an image and,
,,,  analogy that my audience can grasp here,
,,,  two more this come from a tech company,
,,,  who wa in the process of acquiring,
wVcxAhbeMWc13,2.54,3.06,  another corporation and they said that,No
,,,  we have to a we continue to run our own,
,,,  business acquire this other corporation,
,,,  and integrated into our service so he,
,,,  said that what we 're going to do is be,
,,,  running down the highway we 're gon na be,
wVcxAhbeMWc14,3.08,3.19,  driving down the highway at 70 mile an,No
,,,  hour changing the tire a we go great,
,,,  image it warns his staff and warned his,
,,,  team that what they were in for wa a,
,,,  very intensive period and it gave them,
,,,  an image to keep in mind and here 's the,
wVcxAhbeMWc15,3.22,3.33,  fourth the fourth come from the,Structure
,,,  insurance world someone wa talking,
,,,  about the importance of life insurance,
,,,  of Disability Insurance with health,
,,,  insurance and they said if you would,
,,,  imagine just vow that your family ha,
wVcxAhbeMWc16,3.36,3.46,  perhaps it 's an heirloom you would n't,No
,,,  ship it off across the country in a,
,,,  cardboard box without first wrapping it,
,,,  in bubble wrap,
,,,  he said insurance is like bubble wrap,
,,,  you take something very precious your,
wVcxAhbeMWc18,3.48,4.09,  life your health your future and you,No
,,,  wrap it up in something very protective,
,,,  so that when you send it off it 's safe,
,,,  so think again what are the image that,
,,,  you can use to incorporate into your,
,,,  presentation to communicate a complex,
,,,  concept so that your audience will,
,,,  recognize it remember it and most,
,,,  importantly repeat it to others,
Q5WT2vweFRY1,0,0.12,  we 've worked in the live event and,No
,,,  production industry for over 40 year,
,,,  and have worked with hundred of,
,,,  presenter all over the world in this,
,,,  video we are going to share with you our,
,,,  top 10 tip guaranteed to make you a,
Q5WT2vweFRY2,0.16,0.32,  better presenter so let 's get started,No
,,,  number one focus on the audience your,
,,,  presentation is not about you it 's about,
,,,  the audience what benefit will the,
,,,  audience get from listening to you what,
,,,  do you want them to think feel and do a,
Q5WT2vweFRY3,0.34,0.49,  a result of listening to you once you,No
,,,  have these clear objective in your mind,
,,,  you are on your way to delivering a,
,,,  winning presentation number two,
,,,  delete all excess text from your slide,
,,,  load of bullet point on your slide,
Q5WT2vweFRY4,0.52,1.05,  are a complete waste of time nobody,No
,,,  actually read them the brain is a self,
,,,  organizing mechanism if you use slide,
,,,  like these you 're sending a signal,
,,,  directly to the audience to start,
,,,  daydreaming your slide are not your,
Q5WT2vweFRY5,1.08,1.26,  speaker note use powerful image and,No
,,,  picture they are much more effective in,
,,,  getting your message across number three,
,,,  keep it simple le really is more get,
,,,  used to cutting out material including,
,,,  your presentation only what really,
Q5WT2vweFRY6,1.28,1.41,  matter this is a difficult process but,Structure
,,,  think back to point one what do you want,
,,,  the audience to think feel and do if,
,,,  your content doe n't match your answer,
,,,  to these question cut it out,
,,,  use the same language that you 'd use,
Q5WT2vweFRY7,1.44,1.55,  while explaining your presentation to a,No
,,,  friend in the local pub over a pint and,
,,,  try to use simple wording to to make,

Q5WT2vweFRY8,1.59,2.12,  number four rehearse always always,No
,,,  rehearse the biggest single difference a,
,,,  presenter can make to their performance,
,,,  is to stand up in front of the bathroom,
,,,  mirror,
,,,  amra her,
Q5WT2vweFRY9,2.13,2.28,  if you are serious about success then,Structure
,,,  you need to get serious about rehearsing,
,,,  and if you do n't prepare them prepare to,
,,,  fail number five is especially important,
,,,  if you 're speaking at an event or away,
,,,  from your usual place of work make,

,,,  practice your delivery so what doe that,
,,,  mean practice your delivery so you 've,
,,,  got your content right so you 've got,
,,,  your knowledge you know something you 've,
,,,  worked on organizing it around a message,
T-dbUrluW0M2,0.18,0.29,  you 've worked on putting the,No
,,,  storytelling element in now we 're going,
,,,  to the communication piece so you 're,
,,,  going to practice your delivery so that,
,,,  you communicate the message you want to,
,,,  communicate I 'm a big believer in the,
T-dbUrluW0M3,0.32,0.49,  concept of a dress rehearsal so we want,Structure
,,,  to again borrow that concept of dress,
,,,  rehearsal and apply it here two,
,,,  presentation so if you are presenting,
,,,  to a new audience in a new location with,
,,,  new content you need a dress rehearsal,
T-dbUrluW0M4,0.51,1.02,  or you ca n't just walk in cold and say,No
,,,  oh yeah I 'm going to talk to this,
,,,  project that I just got put on yesterday,
,,,  I do n't really not familiar with it and,
,,,  I 'm in this new office location so I 'm,
,,,  not quite sure where the office is in,
T-dbUrluW0M5,1.03,1.12,  the building I do n't know what room it 's,No
,,,  in and I do n't know if I 'm going to have,
,,,  slide or if the projector in the,
,,,  ceiling or if I 'm going to stand here,
,,,  and it 's a big room should I have a mic,
,,,  you ca n't walk in cold and be successful,
T-dbUrluW0M6,1.15,1.28,  it 's very difficult to just walk in cold,No
,,,  to a completely new environment be,
,,,  successful so the concept of a dress,
,,,  rehearsal can help you want to actually,
,,,  stand up and say the word out loud in,
,,,  a real a situation a possible so if,
T-dbUrluW0M7,1.31,1.4,  you 're going to be in a conference room,No
,,,  is their conference room you can,
,,,  practice in if suddenly you have to be,
,,,  at a conference or an association,
,,,  meeting and you 've got a dress in a suit,
,,,  and tie and normally you wear jean and,
T-dbUrluW0M8,1.43,1.51,  a t to work but now you 're going,No
,,,  to present in a suit and tie if you 're,
,,,  not used to wearing a suit and tie,
,,,  that 's going to be really uncomfortable,
,,,  that first time you can be fidgeting,
,,,  with it and you know caught it doing all,
T-dbUrluW0M9,1.53,2.05,  this and you 're going to lose the focus,No
,,,  and distract the audience so practicing,
,,,  a real a situation a possible,
,,,  particularly if there are new element,
,,,  sometimes we practice how we look at the,
,,,  computer we run our slide we just look,
T-dbUrluW0M10,2.11,2.19,  at the computer we run our slide in our,No
,,,  head and we do maybe maybe we 're,
,,,  talking,
,,,  our head it 's not effective because I,
,,,  can look at my slide and have the,
,,,  greatest story in my head but when I,
T-dbUrluW0M11,2.22,2.35,  actually have to make it go from the,Structure
,,,  brain to the mouth and come out a,
,,,  coherent it 's hard because where do we,
,,,  get tripped up we get tripped up on the,
,,,  transition well now I 'm going to talk,
,,,  about right and if you 've got a lot of,
T-dbUrluW0M12,2.37,2.46,  slide and you 're transitioning you get,No
,,,  tripped up because you have n't practiced,
,,,  that because that 's not really part of,
,,,  the story in your head but if you were,
,,,  to stand in your office close the door,
,,,  if you have one if not bathroom are,
T-dbUrluW0M13,2.48,2.59,  always a good place to practice if it 's,No
,,,  the only place that you know you can get,
,,,  a cubicle with a door stand up and you,
,,,  know stand up and practice see the word,
,,,  out loud see if you can figure out how,
,,,  it 's going to come out especially your,
T-dbUrluW0M14,3.01,3.1,  first couple of sentence where you,No
,,,  introduce your message a first couple,
,,,  of sentence are so key because they,
,,,  help you get off on the right foot they,
,,,  help you relax if you 're nervous and,
,,,  they help key to the audience what,
T-dbUrluW0M15,3.13,3.25,  you 're going to be talking about so even,Structure
,,,  just practice that part and your,
,,,  transition and the conclusion because,
,,,  then you 're anchoring the presentation,
,,,  now people say well I 've got to talk for,
,,,  an hour I 'm not going to stand up and do,
T-dbUrluW0M16,3.26,3.38,  a full hour dress rehearsal I do n't know,No
,,,  depends I 've done it if it 's important,
,,,  enough if you 're motivated enough and if,
,,,  you have the time it would be very,
,,,  helpful especially again if it 's new,
,,,  material if you 've given the same,
T-dbUrluW0M17,3.4,3.51,  presentation every week for month okay,No
,,,  you do n't need a full hour dress,
,,,  rehearsal but if it 's new stuff and the,
,,,  stake are high you 're in front of a new,
,,,  audience dress rehearsal play and,
,,,  musical and performance use it for a,
T-dbUrluW0M19,3.53,4.07,  reason because that 's where we figure,No
,,,  out what thing are going to go wrong,
,,,  and we 're more comfortable in that so it,
,,,  encouraged you to apply this concept of,
,,,  dress rehearsal to the presentation,
,,,  you have to give particularly with new,
,,,  stuff particularly if the stake are,
,,,  high,
oSZfqCBUpOs1,0,0.1,   An initial public offering,Structure
,,,  when a successful private company,
,,,  decides to offer share to the public,
,,,  is an exciting time for the company,
,,,  it original shareholder and the investing public .,
,,,  All of the excitement and publicity around an IPO,
oSZfqCBUpOs2,0.13,0.27,  often lead investor to want to get in on the action .,No
,,,  If you can get in on the ground floor of an IPO,
,,,  that is get an allocation in the initial share offering,
,,,  before the stock start trading,
,,,  there is evidence that you are likely to make a profit .,
,,,  IPOs tend to be underpriced .,
oSZfqCBUpOs3,0.3,0.41,  While this might seem like an obvious way to easy profit,Structure
,,,  there are a few crucially important thing,
,,,  for you to consider .,
,,,  I 'm Ben Felix Portfolio Manager at PWL Capital .,
,,,  In this episode of Common Sense Investing,
,,,  I 'm going to tell you why IPOs do n't live up to the hype .,
oSZfqCBUpOs4,0.45,1,  ( driving electronic music ),No
,,,  It is well that IPOs tend to be underpriced .,
,,,  In other word when the underwriter determines the price,
,,,  that the company should offer it share to the public,
,,,  the data show that they tend to set a price,
,,,  below where the market will price the share .,
oSZfqCBUpOs5,1.03,1.14,  This creates the perception,No
,,,  of a real opportunity for investor,
,,,  to make a quick profit on the first day of an IPO .,
,,,  The medium often enjoy reporting,
,,,  on the large first profit that IPO investor make .,
,,,  The challenge for most investor though,
oSZfqCBUpOs6,1.17,1.28,  is that getting in on the initial allocation is really hard .,Structure
,,,  The majority of the initial allocation,
,,,  generally go to institutional investor,
,,,  which we will touch on again in a minute,
,,,  while the allotment for retail investor,
,,,  is likely to be allocated to larger brokerage client .,
oSZfqCBUpOs7,1.32,1.45,  Fidelity describes the allocation process,Structure
,,,  for retail investor a follows .,
,,,  Each customer who want to participate in an IPO offering,
,,,  is evaluated and ranked based on his or her asset,
,,,  and the revenue they generate for the brokerage firm .,
,,,  Typically customer with significant,
oSZfqCBUpOs8,1.47,1.59,  long relationship with their brokerage firm,Structure
,,,  will receive higher priority,
,,,  than those with smaller or new relationship .,
,,,  This statement from Fidelity is supported,
,,,  by a 2018 paper in the Journal of Fice titled,
,,,  `` Quid Pro Quo ?,
oSZfqCBUpOs9,2,2.15,  What Factors Influence IPO Allocations to Investors ? ``,Structure
,,,  where the author examined 220 IPOs,
,,,  from January 2010 through May 2015,
,,,  to test the determit of IPO allocation .,
,,,  They found strong support,
,,,  for the brokerage revenue associated with a client,
oSZfqCBUpOs10,2.18,2.28,  being a significant determit,Structure
,,,  of investor ' IPO allocation and profit .,
,,,  Based on this if you are able,
,,,  to get in on an initial allocation,
,,,  unless you 're a high value brokerage client,
,,,  or an institution,
oSZfqCBUpOs11,2.3,2.43,  you 're likely getting in on an IPO,Structure
,,,  with a poor expected outcome .,
,,,  There is adverse selection in IPO allotment,
,,,  where those with expected weak first return,
,,,  have been easier to get access to ahead of time .,
,,,  I think it 's safe to say that in general,
oSZfqCBUpOs12,2.45,2.56,  smaller retail investor and DIY investor,Structure
,,,  who are not generating significant revenue,
,,,  for their brokerage firm,
,,,  will be hard pressed to get in on the initial allocation,
,,,  when a hot company go public .,
,,,  Interestingly there is evidence that new mutual fund,
oSZfqCBUpOs13,3,3.12,  use their institutional status and relationship,No
,,,  to get in on initial IPO allocation,
,,,  in an effort to boost their return .,
,,,  This wa detailed in a 2017 paper,
,,,  `` IPO Allocations and New Mutual Funds '',
,,,  by Frankie Chau Yi Gu and Christodoulos Louca .,
oSZfqCBUpOs14,3.16,3.3,  They looked at data from 1998 to 2015,Structure
,,,  and found that new mutual fund tend to outperform,
,,,  during the first six month after inception .,
,,,  This outperformance wa concentrated,
,,,  in new fund that held underpriced IPO stock .,
,,,  After the first six month performance fell substantially .,
oSZfqCBUpOs15,3.33,3.44,  The suggestion in the paper,Structure
,,,  is that a fund company might choose to allocate,
,,,  all of their IPO allotment to a new fund,
,,,  in an effort to boost it performance,
,,,  to attract new investor .,
,,,  While this work to get an initial boost,
oSZfqCBUpOs16,3.45,3.55,  the fund performance tends to drop off quickly .,Structure
,,,  The reason that this information,
,,,  is relevant to our discussion,
,,,  is that it show the level of competition,
,,,  for initial IPO allotment .,
,,,  I would n't take this a a signal,
oSZfqCBUpOs17,3.57,4.08,  that all new mutual fund will perform well .,Structure
,,,  Keep in mind it is easy to identify the fund,
,,,  receiving preferential IPO allocation after the fact,
,,,  but I would n't start speculating on new mutual fund,
,,,  in an effort to profit from this phenomenon .,
,,,  All right so you 're probably not going to get in,
oSZfqCBUpOs18,4.11,4.22,  on the initial allocation when a company go public,Structure
,,,  but that doe n't mean that you ca n't buy share,
,,,  on the first day of trading .,
,,,  Once the share are listed on a stock exchange,
,,,  many of the people holding the share,
,,,  will want to realize the profit,
oSZfqCBUpOs19,4.23,4.35,  from the likely underpriced IPO,No
,,,  and you could be the one to buy them .,
,,,  The performance of IPOs after the first day of trading,
,,,  ha also been studied extensively .,
,,,  In the March 2017 paper,
,,,  `` The Long Performance of IPOs Revisited '',
oSZfqCBUpOs20,4.38,4.55,  Daniel Hoechle Larissa Karthaus and Markus Schmid,Structure
,,,  detailed the performance of US IPOs between 1975 and 2014 .,
,,,  They looked at a total of 7,
,,,  over time period ranging from one to 40 quarter,
,,,  after the first trading day .,
,,,  They found that IPO firm tended to behave,
oSZfqCBUpOs21,4.58,5.09,  like high beta stock,No
,,,  with negative loading to the value factor,
,,,  and that they underperform for the first two year,
,,,  even when common risk factor,
,,,  like size relative price and momentum are accounted for .,
,,,  This underperformance gradually decline,
oSZfqCBUpOs22,5.11,5.24,  with longer time period,No
,,,  becoming statistically insignificant after two year .,
,,,  In summary of their paper,
,,,  IPO firm have unfavorable exposure to risk factor,
,,,  with high beta and negative loading to value,
,,,  but even when those are accounted for,
oSZfqCBUpOs23,5.26,5.44,  IPO firm tend to underperform for the first two year .,Structure
,,,  These finding are also supported by more recent research .,
,,,  In a 2019 paper from Dimensional Fund Advisors,
,,,  the author examined 6,
,,,  between January 1991 and December 2018 .,
,,,  To evaluate IPO performance a a whole,
oSZfqCBUpOs24,5.46,5.57,  they constructed a hypothetical,Structure
,,,  market weighted portfolio of IPOs,
,,,  issued over the preceding 12 period,
,,,  and rebalanced monthly .,
,,,  They excluded first return from the analysis .,
,,,  They found that over the full sample period,
oSZfqCBUpOs25,5.59,6.19,  the IPO portfolio delivered a return of 6.93 %,Structure
,,,  with a standard deviation of 27.62 %,
,,,  while the Russell 3000 Index a US total market index,
,,,  delivered a 9.13 % return with a 14.28 % standard deviation .,
,,,  They also split the full sample period into two sub,
,,,  with one ending in the year 2000,
oSZfqCBUpOs26,6.21,6.33,  to isolate the high volume of IPOs over that time period .,Structure
,,,  The result for both sub,
,,,  before and after the year 2000,
,,,  exhibited underperformance relative to the market,
,,,  with substantially more risk,
,,,  a measured by the standard deviation of return .,
oSZfqCBUpOs27,6.36,6.46,  This result corroborates the finding,Structure
,,,  of Hoechle Karthaus and Schmid,
,,,  who found that IPOs perform poorly over the first two year .,
,,,  The Dimensional paper also applied,
,,,  the Fama/French five model,
,,,  to the IPO portfolio ' return,
oSZfqCBUpOs28,6.49,7.01,  and found that the return are well explained,No
,,,  by the factor in the model,
,,,  market beta company size relative price,
,,,  profitability and investment .,
,,,  This suggests that IPO firm a a group,
,,,  have behaved like small cap growth stock,
oSZfqCBUpOs29,7.03,7.15,  with weak profitability that invest aggressively .,No
,,,  These type of stock whether they are recent IPOs or not,
,,,  tend to underperform the market .,
,,,  What we can conclude from the research,
,,,  that we have discussed in this video is that,
,,,  if you want to make money from IPOs,
oSZfqCBUpOs30,7.17,7.31,  you have to get in on the initial allocation,No
,,,  but doing so especially for hot IPOs,
,,,  is really unlikely unless you are considered,
,,,  a highly valued client by your brokerage .,
,,,  If you are able to get in on the initial allocation,
,,,  there 's a good chance that it 's not an IPO,
oSZfqCBUpOs31,7.33,7.45,  that will have a big first pop .,Structure
,,,  The better the expected pop,
,,,  the more likely the IPO share will be allotted,
,,,  to institution and the largest retail client .,
,,,  If you miss out on the initial allocation,
,,,  and instead buy the share on the secondary market,
oSZfqCBUpOs32,7.47,7.58,  once they 've started trading,Structure
,,,  you 're buying into share that will likely perform,
,,,  like a small growth low profitability,
,,,  high investment firm,
,,,  which have an unattractive risk/return profile .,
,,,  Even beyond that let 's keep in mind that,
oSZfqCBUpOs33,8,8.11,  any time that you buy one stock,No
,,,  you probably are n't going to get the return,
,,,  of the asset class that it belongs to .,
,,,  On average a secondary market IPO investment,
,,,  will give you the poor expected outcome,
,,,  of small growth low profitability high investment stock .,
oSZfqCBUpOs34,8.15,8.27,  But unless you are building,Structure
,,,  a diversified portfolio of recent IPO stock,
,,,  your actual outcome on an individual stock investment,
,,,  will be driven by the specific risk of the company,
,,,  which delivers a random outcome .,

,,, every presentation should aim not only,
El2bHe0GuZQ2,0.17,0.28, to close sales but to build and improve,No
,,, the long-term relationship with your,
,,, audience here are four principles to,
,,, consider when delivering to make sure,
,,, that your presentation is engaging for,
,,, the audience principle number one use,
El2bHe0GuZQ3,0.32,0.44, strong and open body language this means,No
,,, standing up straight with your shoulders,
,,, back looking the customer in the eye and,
,,, smiling it's extremely important that,
,,, you come across this self-assured,
,,, friendly and approachable to the,
El2bHe0GuZQ4,0.46,0.57, customer in part a relaxed and confident,No

,,, impression even if the customer is aware,
El2bHe0GuZQ5,1,1.12, that you are a bit nervous they'll,No
,,, appreciate and respect the fact that,
,,, you're doing your best for them,
,,, principle number two use visual aids,
,,, make sure that your use of visual aids,
,,, is skilled and smooth and not excessive,
El2bHe0GuZQ6,1.15,1.28, remember that a picture speaks a,No

,,, principle number three know your role,
,,, this really applies when you're,
,,, delivering as part of a team make sure,
,,, that all members know their role you,
El2bHe0GuZQ8,1.42,1.53, might be conducting a presentation in,Structure

,,, even during the parts of your,
El2bHe0GuZQ11,2.24,2.34, presentation which are pre-planned keep,No

,,, if you sense disagreement or confusion,
,,, consider stopping your flow momentarily,
El2bHe0GuZQ12,2.37,2.49, to check for misunderstandings if you,No
,,, just keep going the audience may tune,
,,, out of what you're saying whatever,
,,, choice you make always seek to maximize,
,,, the involvement and engagement of the,
,,, audience some delivery approaches really,
El2bHe0GuZQ14,2.52,3.08, encourage interaction for example a,No
,,, common technique is to consult the,
,,, customer on an important issue taking,
,,, notes on a whiteboard or flip chart this,
,,, involves the customer and shows you,
,,, understand their perspective later you,
,,, can present your products and services,
,,, as the solution to this problem,
9IEys7g2YFc1,0.05,0.17, hello there and welcome to improve your,No
,,, voice my name is Darren McStay and today,
,,, we're going to talk about learning to,
,,, speak more clearly through daily,
,,, practice so every time I get a message,
,,, relating to how someone can improve,
9IEys7g2YFc2,0.19,0.3, their voice it's often followed by the,No
,,, assumption that they can get this,
,,, quickly laughs it's a quick fix of how,
,,, to get this done unfortunately with the,
,,, voice it doesn't really work like that,
,,, your voice is created by your body using,
9IEys7g2YFc3,0.34,0.47, air manipulated accordingly through,No
,,, intentions and impulses created by the,
,,, mind your body is a physiological,
,,, machine it is an instrument made of,
,,, muscle bone fasciae and many other bits,
,,, and bobs thrown in if you want to train,
9IEys7g2YFc4,0.49,1.01, this instrument to perform better then,No
,,, you are no different to an athlete who,
,,, also has to train their body only we're,
,,, training our bodies in different ways,
,,, and of course we all know that the,
,,, smarter an athlete works and the more,
9IEys7g2YFc5,1.04,1.13, consistent they are with their work the,Structure
,,, better they become this means that if,
,,, you want to create permanent and,
,,, positive results which will ensure your,
,,, instrument can function to the best of,
,,, its ability then you need to think and,
9IEys7g2YFc6,1.15,1.27, train like an athlete okay not by using,No
,,, the same muscles the same way as an,
,,, athlete but you need to practice,
,,, regularly and dare I say it daily do you,
,,, want to get better practice daily want,
,,, to stop mumbling practice daily,
9IEys7g2YFc7,1.29,1.41, improve your confidence practice daily,No
,,, articulate better resonate more become,
,,, more present practice daily but most,
,,, importantly and according to the way,
,,, this video is titled if you want to be,
,,, clearer and better understood then you,
9IEys7g2YFc8,1.43,1.55, need to practice speaking clearer daily,No
,,, so it's all very well taking the,
,,, exercises from my channel and also for,
,,, my online course which are designed to,
,,, make your instrument the best it can be,
,,, but if you're not practicing using that,
9IEys7g2YFc9,1.57,2.08, instrument it's just going to start,No
,,, getting a bit rusty and a bit dusty so,
,,, even though it's a good instrument,
,,, innocent good shape it still needs to be,
,,, played and what I mean by that is to,
,,, become more mindful and more purposeful,
9IEys7g2YFc10,2.11,2.21, with how you speak daily so in order for,No
,,, you to learn,
,,, and to understand and start practicing,
,,, speaking more clearly daily I'm going to,
,,, set you a task now which you can start,
,,, once this video is complete I want you,
9IEys7g2YFc11,2.23,2.38, to go and find someone whose voice you,No
,,, like now this could be a TV personality,
,,, a newsreader an actor politician anyone,
,,, that you know whose voice you can find,
,,, in many places beyond films radio,
,,, cassette recordings or anywhere you can,
9IEys7g2YFc12,2.4,2.5, find it on the Internet is a great,No
,,, source of material of course find,
,,, someone whose voice you would like to,
,,, sound a bit like and what I want you to,
,,, do is find the 30 to 60 seconds max,
,,, recording and put it on your phone or,
9IEys7g2YFc13,2.53,3.04, your laptop of this person speaking and,No
,,, what you're going to do is every day,
,,, you're going to play that recording back,
,,, listen to it stop it every few seconds,
,,, and repeat what that person is saying,
,,, exactly as you think they sound when,
9IEys7g2YFc14,3.07,3.17, they say it now I think it's important,No
,,, that you find someone who you believe to,
,,, be a good speaker someone you find to be,
,,, articulate and clear in their voice not,
,,, just someone you like their voice if,
,,, it's a singer for example if it's a,
9IEys7g2YFc15,3.19,3.28, mumble rapper that's not going to get,No
,,, you anywhere with your articulation,
,,, clear of speech so what you want to do,
,,, is find someone who maybe uses their,
,,, voice as a speaker for a living possibly,
,,, an actor or like I said before a,
9IEys7g2YFc16,3.31,3.42, politician and try to notice what it is,No
,,, that makes their voice stand out what is,
,,, it that makes it clear and I don't want,
,,, you to worry too much about this I just,
,,, wanted to do it every day now until you,
,,, can impersonate the recording you have,
9IEys7g2YFc17,3.45,3.56, of this person until you can actually do,No
,,, it the way they do it I don't need to,
,,, think too much about what it is they're,
,,, doing I just want you to mimic the,
,,, sounds they make and there's a reason,
,,, for this when we're children everything,
9IEys7g2YFc18,3.57,4.08, we learn is through copying it's through,No
,,, mimicking this is how we learn and what,
,,, happens is as we get older we form,
,,, habits which aren't necessarily so good,
,,, for our speech or good for our lives,
,,, even so what we need to do is to retrain,
9IEys7g2YFc19,4.1,4.2, our bodies to start thinking and acting,No
,,, and copying those who we now wish to,
,,, sound like or we now wish to become so,
,,, specifically with our voices find,
,,, someone who you want to sound like or,
,,, believe that has quality in their voice,
9IEys7g2YFc20,4.22,4.32, that you would like to have in yours and,No
,,, we're going to start mimicking that,
,,, that's how we're going to,
,,, so if there's a lot of words in this,
,,, text you can stop it every few seconds,
,,, and repeat after them or if it's just a,
9IEys7g2YFc21,4.34,4.44, short piece of text maybe it's easy for,No
,,, you to learn it and repeat it back and,
,,, once you get to the point where you can,
,,, remember everything that's great keep,
,,, doing it keep listening to the recording,
,,, every day until you feel you can do a,
9IEys7g2YFc22,4.46,4.55, very good impersonation now the best way,No
,,, for you to find out whether you're,
,,, progressing and getting better with this,
,,, is to record your own voice as well and,
,,, what you should do is if you do this,
,,, listening exercise daily and speak along,
9IEys7g2YFc23,4.59,5.1, with it then at the end of every week,No
,,, you can record your voice and play that,
,,, back against the other one and listen to,
,,, yourself against how you sounded the,
,,, week before so you can do this for two,
,,, weeks a month six months a year if you,
9IEys7g2YFc24,5.13,5.25, like just do it until you're comfortable,No
,,, that something in your voice has changed,
,,, I don't want you to do this without,
,,, using a warm-up or some kind of physical,
,,, exercises that get your body and your,
,,, voice ready to speak now you can do this,
9IEys7g2YFc25,5.27,5.37, one of three ways I have tons of videos,No
,,, on this channel and this one in,
,,, particular is a great warmup I'd like,
,,, you to look at that everyday before you,
,,, do this exercise so this way your body,
,,, is in a really ready state to get,
9IEys7g2YFc26,5.38,5.49, started and if you feel that after doing,No
,,, these exercises for say two weeks or a,
,,, month and doing these warm-up exercises,
,,, and the one I've set you then I think,
,,, you would be ready to check out the,
,,, online course do these exercises daily,
9IEys7g2YFc27,5.51,6.02, go through all my videos find everything,No
,,, you can practice daily,
,,, make something up maybe just do one,
,,, video a day failing that if you really,
,,, don't want to do these exercises and you,
,,, don't want to practice daily you're not,
9IEys7g2YFc28,6.04,6.15, going to get as far as you want as quick,No
,,, as you'd like of course if you want to,
,,, make permanent changes in your voice and,
,,, permanent changes positive results from,
,,, your instrument then you need to do a,
,,, very specific set of exercises which is,
9IEys7g2YFc29,6.18,6.26, why I put together my eight-week online,Structure
,,, course because it took me 25 years to,
,,, amass all that information and put it,
,,, together in a structured way that I,
,,, could teach others to literally,
,,, transform their bodies from where ever,
9IEys7g2YFc31,6.28,6.42, they are into the ultimate speaking,No
,,, machine but that aside you have your,
,,, task whether you choose to take it or,
,,, not it's up to you I hope you do thanks,
,,, for joining me my name is Darren McStay,
,,, this is improve your voice,
,,, and until the next time practice using a,
,,, voice,
Js7-OWd19PE1,0.08,0.23, it's beautiful thank you thank you hello,No
,,, I am going to be using this microphone,
,,, because there is a video happening so,
,,, ordinarily I would not be using the,
,,, microphone so i hope you can hear me,
,,, well i'm very very excited to be here,
Js7-OWd19PE2,0.27,0.39, today that's the first thing i want to,Structure
,,, say to you and I know there is a,
,,, cross-section probably if people hear,
,,, from with various startups right yes and,
,,, you've been doing many many things in,
,,, your fields making your ideas happen and,
Js7-OWd19PE3,0.41,0.53, one of the things I want to begin with,Structure
,,, is this lee mentioned i think in his,
,,, introduction that one of my specialties,
,,, is something called improvisational,
,,, leadership and this is something that i,
,,, created over the years I've always had a,
Js7-OWd19PE4,0.55,1.09, dual career where I have blended my work,No
,,, as a consultant in organizations helping,
,,, organizations and leaders with executive,
,,, coaching as well grow their ideas,
,,, through their leadership effectively and,
,,, the leadership is something that I am,
Js7-OWd19PE5,1.11,1.25, very passionate about early in my career,No
,,, I realized that the very same skills,
,,, that actors use and musicians use are,
,,, there any people here who play music in,
,,, any way who are musicians yes you know,
,,, musicians improvise right actors,
Js7-OWd19PE6,1.27,1.41, improvise and the skills that allow you,No
,,, to do that well and to be very very,
,,, skilled at that are the same exact tools,
,,, that are needed for leaders in order to,
,,, be effective as influencers because,
,,, basically when it comes down to making a,
Js7-OWd19PE7,1.43,1.57, pitch what you're doing is in that,Structure
,,, moment you are the leader of the idea,
,,, that you're putting forth and you are,
,,, trying to influence whoever is listening,
,,, to you to buy into that idea right so,
,,, it's a job that really requires a lot of,
Js7-OWd19PE8,2,2.12, skill and I mentioned the,No
,,, improvisational leadership piece because,
,,, actually the very first dimension of,
,,, improvisational leadership has to do,
,,, with having a strong understanding that,
,,, really all that exists in any given,
Js7-OWd19PE9,2.15,2.3, interaction is you the other person or,No
,,, people and the,
,,, moment that you share together the,
,,, moment right now we're in a moment yes,
,,, you came from something a moment ago so,
,,, did I we rushed over here after talking,
Js7-OWd19PE10,2.32,2.45, to the folks from that video challenge,Structure
,,, competition and now we're here and,
,,, everyone in this room has another moment,
,,, to get to after this for this brief time,
,,, our time together needs to be focused on,
,,, making this moment rich for each of us a,
Js7-OWd19PE11,2.48,3.01, collaboration when you're making a,Structure
,,, business pitch one of the essential,
,,, aspects of the business pitch and,
,,, presentation is that we have a healthy,
,,, respect for the moment that we're,
,,, sharing with that person what does that,
Js7-OWd19PE12,3.02,3.15, mean it means that we remove as many,No
,,, distractions as possible so if you're,
,,, making a video pitch what we see,
,,, graphically that's in the presentation,
,,, especially at the very beginning has to,
,,, be in concert in harmony with what,
Js7-OWd19PE13,3.19,3.32, you're saying the person who is there on,No
,,, camera has to be communicating something,
,,, that connects to the audience and builds,
,,, a relationship and if you're in person,
,,, the very same thing has to happen the,
,,, job of the presenter is to make a,
Js7-OWd19PE14,3.34,3.49, connection to make a relationship to the,No
,,, people who are there now in any business,
,,, pitch or presentation the first,
,,, important reality speaking of the moment,
,,, is this it's the hook it's that which,
,,, will draw in the audience and I'm sure,
Js7-OWd19PE15,3.51,4.05, you all know this how many people have,No
,,, heard about the hook before of course to,
,,, hook somebody and means it's a simple,
,,, word that basically means this I care,
,,, enough about you and I have respect for,
,,, you in terms of your time and all that,
Js7-OWd19PE16,4.08,4.23, you have going on that I will make sure,Structure
,,, that I get right to the heart of what I,
,,, want you to know about what I think,
,,, might help you and hooking somebody and,
,,, means getting their attention it's means,
,,, snapping them into awareness we need the,
Js7-OWd19PE17,4.26,4.38, hook now more than we needed it even 30,No
,,, years ago in advertising 50 years ago,
,,, you know mad men period anybody know,
,,, Mad Men TV show that's in the United,
,,, States it'll it'll definitely i'm sure,
,,, reach here at some point it's all about,
Js7-OWd19PE18,4.4,4.57, advertising in the 1960s and the hook,No
,,, was important than to the difference now,
,,, is that our attention span today in 2015,
,,, is different literally the neuro,
,,, transmitters of the brain the synapses,
,,, our brains have changed the connection,
Js7-OWd19PE19,5,5.18, between our brains the visual abilities,No
,,, and our ability to process data has,
,,, changed we have a faster ability to,
,,, synthesize imagery because in video and,
,,, film edits and frames have changed have,
,,, you watched a movie made in the 1940s,
Js7-OWd19PE20,5.2,5.32, for example and you notice that,No
,,, sometimes it'll stay on the same scene,
,,, for quite a while and then it might,
,,, change to something else later in the,
,,, 1980s and so certainly the 70s there was,
,,, experimentation with the use of video,
Js7-OWd19PE21,5.35,5.48, suddenly we have this very fast-paced,No
,,, editing that happens which means that,
,,, people become accustomed to quick cuts,
,,, you know what i mean right so we have a,
,,, very very fast ability to go from one,
,,, thought to another to another that,
Js7-OWd19PE22,5.49,6.02, almost replicates what goes on in the,No
,,, brain so if you don't hook somebody and,
,,, right at the beginning your movie if,
,,, you're presenting a movie or your visual,
,,, presence because right now i'm like the,
,,, movie you're watching will become second,
Js7-OWd19PE23,6.05,6.17, to the movie going on inside of the mind,No
,,, of the audience because you didn't hook,
,,, them in so now they get hooked in by,
,,, their thoughts by who they have to call,
,,, by the fight they had with their,
,,, girlfriend before they left for work by,
Js7-OWd19PE24,6.2,6.29, the fact that oh my god it's my,No
,,, husband's birthday today i have to go,
,,, buy something and all of a sudden I'm,
,,, not listening to what the presenter is,
,,, saying so number one is grab the,
,,, attention of the listener how do we do,
Js7-OWd19PE25,6.31,6.47, that before we even begin there's,No
,,, something we bring on stage to help us,
,,, deal with the noise right the noise,
,,, there's always noise there's always,
,,, somebody doing something that,
,,, could be a distraction right now it's a,
Js7-OWd19PE26,6.49,7.02, hammer you can hear a hammer the other,No
,,, day yesterday when I was teaching a temp,
,,, jam in the middle of the workshop,
,,, somebody decided to wash the windows and,
,,, I mean really in a very devoted and,
,,, passionate way he was washing the,
Js7-OWd19PE27,7.03,7.14, windows the windows were shaking and we,No
,,, could feel the earth moving at first I,
,,, thought it's not an earthquake is it and,
,,, then I realized no there's a guy washing,
,,, the windows so there's always something,
,,, that we have to be in a way dealing with,
Js7-OWd19PE28,7.16,7.3, what we bring on stage to hook people,No
,,, before we open our mouths and say,
,,, anything is our body and our mind and,
,,, our intention one of the first things I,
,,, want to convey to you before I talk,
,,, about the presence which is the other,
Js7-OWd19PE29,7.32,7.47, word that I would use the presence that,No
,,, we have that has to find a way to,
,,, connect with the audience is this words,
,,, are important what's more important than,
,,, the words because people don't really,
,,, hear the words as much as they hear the,
Js7-OWd19PE30,7.5,8.04, intention behind the words if you can go,Structure
,,, home with that idea it would be maybe,
,,, the key to something very powerful in,
,,, making your pitches it's the intention,
,,, behind the word that is conveyed that,
,,, matters it's not all the data and you,
Js7-OWd19PE31,8.07,8.2, telling me how great the data is that,No
,,, really matters it's your intention it's,
,,, the emotion it's what I feel about the,
,,, idea it's what I feel about you and why,
,,, I think my idea might help you and what,
,,, my intention is which is hopefully to,
Js7-OWd19PE32,8.22,8.35, help you to motivate you to influence,No
,,, you to see that maybe your life might,
,,, need this improvement that I might be,
,,, talking about while I'm talking to you,
,,, right now there's an intention that I,
,,, feel as I'm speaking to you I'm saying,
Js7-OWd19PE33,8.37,8.51, words and maybe you're picking up my,No
,,, intention what intention are you picking,
,,, up as I speak to you right now about,
,,, this subject so far quick just somebody,
,,, call it out or raise a hand yes I want,
,,, to help this is true this is what I feel,
Js7-OWd19PE34,8.52,9.03, so you're matching something that I feel,No
,,, that I've been a little successful that,
,,, maybe you were feeling that any other,
,,, intention that you're feeling,
,,, me right now about what I feel about,
,,, this topic I want to hook you into yes,
Js7-OWd19PE35,9.08,9.24, I'm talking about hooking and I'm doing,No
,,, that while i'm talking yes exactly what,
,,, else what emotion do you feel I'm,
,,, conveying right now to be a model yes,
,,, thank you someone else I love the topic,
,,, yes and in fact can you feel that I love,
Js7-OWd19PE36,9.27,9.43, this topic because I care about the,No
,,, stories that get conveyed about business,
,,, I teach at MIT Sloan I am around many,
,,, people at MIT who have brilliant ideas,
,,, I'm in the business school so of course,
,,, there are many people doing startups and,
Js7-OWd19PE37,9.45,9.56, the story of these startups is very,No
,,, important to me because of my background,
,,, also in theatre there's another reason I,
,,, care about story because story is the,
,,, stuff that makes the human being the,
,,, human community move forward and learn,
Js7-OWd19PE38,9.58,10.12, about itself it brings comfort religion,Structure
,,, is a story it's the story that comforts,
,,, people science has a story it's a story,
,,, that makes us understand the universe so,
,,, when I say to you that the intention is,
,,, important I cannot say that strongly,
Js7-OWd19PE39,10.14,10.27, enough because the words are great it's,Structure
,,, nice to have the data it's important,
,,, it's essential we need to have a,
,,, concrete very very specific technical,
,,, backup to whatever we say I don't in any,
,,, way contradict that and all of the,
Js7-OWd19PE40,10.3,10.43, technical knowledge will be lost if the,No
,,, intention behind the words is not human,
,,, and making relationship and it has to,
,,, dare to look into the eyes of the person,
,,, you're talking to even if you're on a,
,,, video you have to look right through the,
Js7-OWd19PE41,10.45,11, camera into the person who you visualize,No
,,, you're talking to and speak to the heart,
,,, of that person as if you imagine that,
,,, that person is your friend a trusted,
,,, friend someone you're not threatened by,
,,, so there's the first issue most people,
Js7-OWd19PE42,11.04,11.15, when they create a business pitch the,Structure
,,, first instinct for a beginner and it's,
,,, very natural there's no fault to this,
,,, there's no judgment about this,
,,, most of us will think you know I really,
,,, need to convince the person right have,
Js7-OWd19PE43,11.18,11.31, you felt I need to tell you why my idea,No
,,, is good I need to really give you I have,
,,, to prove it to you I have to prove to,
,,, you that my idea is good what that does,
,,, if you consider it and by the way it's,
,,, understandable that you'd want to do,
Js7-OWd19PE44,11.32,11.43, that because you want to get the money,Structure
,,, you want the venture capitalists you,
,,, want the investors you want to get,
,,, people on board of course right the,
,,, problem that sets up strictly from the,
,,, point of view of telling the story and,
Js7-OWd19PE45,11.46,12.02, having what I said is that moment of,Structure
,,, relationship with your audience is this,
,,, if I am trying to prove to you and,
,,, convince you of my idea I am setting up,
,,, a conflict before I even open up my,
,,, mouth because the conflict becomes I'm,
Js7-OWd19PE46,12.04,12.17, assuming that you don't like my idea or,No
,,, that maybe my idea isn't good enough,
,,, until I have to prove it so now I've,
,,, already put myself in a lower position,
,,, and it makes me appear less confident if,
,,, my intention is to convince because do,
Js7-OWd19PE47,12.21,12.31, we could try to convince people who,No
,,, already want to listen to us no do you,
,,, like to listen to somebody who is,
,,, standing there trying to tell you why,
,,, you should really want to listen to them,
,,, how do you feel when somebody does that,
Js7-OWd19PE48,12.33,12.45, you tell me when somebody is strongly,No
,,, convincing you I'm trying to tell you,
,,, why you should listen to what they're,
,,, saying how do you feel you tell me,
,,, attacked that's a strong word and that's,
,,, exactly I think and that's why we call,
Js7-OWd19PE49,12.47,13, it by the way hard sell because hard,No
,,, sell is hard and it can feel like an,
,,, attack what else do you feel when,
,,, somebody is telling you what they want,
,,, you to think pressure exactly now you're,
,,, creating the conflict of pressure so the,
Js7-OWd19PE50,13.04,13.18, challenge and the art and why we're all,No
,,, sitting here standing here and sitting,
,,, here today is this the very natural,
,,, instinct that we would all have which is,
,,, normal which is to say I want to make a,
,,, business pitch so I want to convince you,
Js7-OWd19PE51,13.2,13.34, is the very thing that can most work,No
,,, against the business pinch pitch,
,,, if you most work against it so wow what,
,,, do we do about that that's our natural,
,,, instinct we have to find a way to,
,,, transform this desire of convincing into,
Js7-OWd19PE52,13.38,13.53, an act of dialogue because when I'm in a,No
,,, dialogue with you and when I'm in a,
,,, conversation I'm not thinking about,
,,, convincing if you're my friend if you're,
,,, somebody who I believe is interested I'm,
,,, more interested now in things like,
Js7-OWd19PE53,13.54,14.08, listening to you sharing something with,No
,,, you offering something which by the way,
,,, an improvisational leadership if you,
,,, took one of those seminars you'd hear me,
,,, say that at the heart of the,
,,, improvisation and improvisational,
Js7-OWd19PE54,14.1,14.23, leadership skill base is something,Structure
,,, called making an offer where you're,
,,, actually having what we call a yes and,
,,, mentality where you make an idea,
,,, offering and whatever the audience says,
,,, back to you you build on it and that's,
Js7-OWd19PE55,14.25,14.4, collaboration these are the things that,Structure
,,, start to happen when we shift from,
,,, convincing to dialogue can you follow,
,,, that and does that connect does that,
,,, make a connection for you yes so I,
,,, mentioned that when we come up on stage,
Js7-OWd19PE56,14.42,14.54, we have something already with us that,No
,,, we carry with us every day which is our,
,,, physical presence and I want to take,
,,, that last word presence because it's so,
,,, important there are five dimensions of,
,,, presence that we need in a presentation,
Js7-OWd19PE57,14.58,15.11, or a pitch basically a pitch is a,Structure
,,, presentation of an idea right it's,
,,, trying to hook someone in one is that,
,,, you if you're making this presentation,
,,, have to be accessible can somebody,
,,, translate accessible for me in Spanish,
Js7-OWd19PE58,15.14,15.27, meaning you're somebody that somebody,No
,,, can approach yes you're you're somebody,
,,, like I can walk towards you and I feel,
,,, like you're accessible you're somebody i,
,,, can go toward and there's not a wall or,
,,, a door or I don't have to call for,
Js7-OWd19PE59,15.28,15.41, people in order to get connected to you,No
,,, right so accessibility is very important,
,,, number two is engagement to have,
,,, presence,
,,, the audience needs to feel they can,
,,, engage with you and also that you are,
Js7-OWd19PE60,15.43,15.56, engaging with them and not talking to,No
,,, yourself or talking to the ideas what,
,,, often happens is that people become so,
,,, consumed in the idea and believe me I've,
,,, been there where you're thinking of a,
,,, new model you're thinking of a new,
Js7-OWd19PE61,15.57,16.09, project your startup idea you've been,No
,,, working on it all hours of the night,
,,, your family never sees you right you're,
,,, so working so much involved and suddenly,
,,, it's almost as if we forget to talk how,
,,, to talk to people we're only talking to,
Js7-OWd19PE62,16.12,16.22, the project we're talking to the ideas,No
,,, we're talking in such a very technical,
,,, way that we're not anymore with the,
,,, people we need to engage the human being,
,,, that's in a moment right in front of us,
,,, the third dimension after accessibility,
Js7-OWd19PE63,16.25,16.42, and engagement is making sure that we,No
,,, have what is perhaps the most essential,
,,, attribute or quality that is needed now,
,,, in business and I'm hearing this in,
,,, business schools everywhere empathy,
,,, empathy you might think wow business,
Js7-OWd19PE64,16.46,17.02, empathy huh what business empathy yeah,No
,,, the world has changed the world is,
,,, changing the hierarchical top-down the,
,,, boss says hey this is the plan now go do,
,,, it and everybody goes in runs and does,
,,, it this hierarchy we still see these,
Js7-OWd19PE65,17.04,17.15, hierarchies and our companies I know,No
,,, they're still here they're in the states,
,,, that hierarchy is changing sometimes,
,,, it's closed sometimes it's open it's,
,,, flat and sometimes you're wondering,
,,, where is the boss either way what is,
Js7-OWd19PE66,17.19,17.33, needed is empathy because when you have,No
,,, greater accessibility to the people and,
,,, you're having less of this hierarchical,
,,, ordering there's a need for more empathy,
,,, so when you're making your pitch you,
,,, have to find a way to talk to the human,
Js7-OWd19PE67,17.35,17.51, heart of the person who you are trying,No
,,, to influence it's not enough to talk to,
,,, their mind it's not enough to talk to,
,,, their knowledge it's very important to,
,,, let your knowledge go through your heart,
,,, and speak to their heart,
Js7-OWd19PE68,17.53,18.03, don't leave the knowledge behind make,No
,,, sure we include the heart when we're,
,,, speaking and the empathy and make sure,
,,, you imagine how that person might be,
,,, feeling and what it would be like to,
,,, feel from that person's perspective,
Js7-OWd19PE69,18.05,18.17, about your idea that's incredibly,No
,,, important one of the techniques I coach,
,,, for people to do when you're getting,
,,, ready to do the pitch the presentation,
,,, whether it's live or not is get a friend,
,,, to play the person that you're pitching,
Js7-OWd19PE70,18.2,18.33, to and let them ask questions don't have,No
,,, them play a skeptical person let them,
,,, play themselves and what they would want,
,,, to ask you what they care about and you,
,,, have to then dialogue with them and use,
,,, some of what you say in that little role,
Js7-OWd19PE71,18.35,18.54, play in your pitch the other very very,No
,,, important essence of presence has to do,
,,, with being able to be expressive and,
,,, when I say expressive I don't mean you,
,,, have to perform or you have to put on a,
,,, show when I say expressiveness what do,
Js7-OWd19PE72,18.58,19.16, you think of what do you think I mean by,No
,,, expressiveness say it again bully talk,
,,, bodytalk body language expressive,
,,, exactly allowing your body to be what we,
,,, say in harmony with your words so that's,
,,, part of one's expressiveness so that I'm,
Js7-OWd19PE73,19.19,19.29, not standing here like now you know,No
,,, talking to you like this right my body,
,,, is not right now we say congruent I just,
,,, learned that there's a similar word in,
,,, Spanish congruent my body isn't coming I,
,,, really care about this subject right but,
Js7-OWd19PE74,19.31,19.44, I don't look right my body is completely,No
,,, contradicting so to really let yourself,
,,, get engaged with what you're saying,
,,, what's another association you have to,
,,, expressiveness what does it mean to be,
,,, expressive it means yes go yes yes which,
Js7-OWd19PE75,19.51,20.03, that emphasis he said the way you,No
,,, emphasize words you don't emphasize the,
,,, words because you're thinking I should,
,,, emphasize usually we emphasize words for,
,,, the same reason in music when the,
,,, dynamics change and it gets louder or,
Js7-OWd19PE76,20.05,20.19, softer or there's an emphasis that,No
,,, happens because of the way the notes are,
,,, arranged it's because the the composer,
,,, felt something and wanted to convey that,
,,, feeling and once that feeling to come,
,,, through the particular tempo and rhythm,
Js7-OWd19PE77,20.2,20.36, and choice of notes and that is the,No
,,, expression expressiveness expressiveness,
,,, means emotion the emotion that's being,
,,, conveyed and that something from the,
,,, inside is being delivered to the outside,
,,, expressed instead of being internalized,
Js7-OWd19PE78,20.42,20.52, finally what we need is a vision and of,No
,,, course you with your startup's you have,
,,, that vision you have the store you have,
,,, the idea sometimes I'm giving,
,,, presentation coaching and people don't,
,,, even know the vision yet of what they,
Js7-OWd19PE79,20.54,21.05, want to be talking about give me an,No
,,, example please of some of the the,
,,, startup projects and ideas that you're,
,,, working on please so I know who's in the,
,,, room I'd love to hear just call it out,
,,, just give me your hand and then tell me,
Js7-OWd19PE80,21.07,21.26, some of the ideas and projects you're,Structure
,,, working on few people anybody have one,
,,, you want to offer yes delivering,
,,, groceries in two hours fantastic,
,,, something else and it doesn't have to be,
,,, that your idea is already fully formed,
Js7-OWd19PE81,21.28,21.5, it can be this is still in an idea stage,No
,,, somebody else yes,
,,, a prosthetic device that can help people,
,,, who've had imputations do the,
,,, rehabilitation process that is so,
,,, important we're dealing with that a lot,
Js7-OWd19PE82,21.51,22.02, now in the states with many many,No
,,, soldiers who've come back this is very,
,,, important it's a big deal it's a very,
,,, big thing and I come from Boston where,
,,, we had the Marathon bombing and we have,
,,, many many people who lost arms and legs,
Js7-OWd19PE83,22.04,22.17, and some people who lost both legs so,No
,,, this is a huge topic I connect with that,
,,, very much so when we have these ideas,
,,, that we have to put forth obviously this,
,,, already tells the story the delivering,
,,, of grocery within two hours groceries we,
Js7-OWd19PE84,22.2,22.31, need that right we don't have time this,No
,,, is not just a nice idea this could be,
,,, essential for somebody's quality of life,
,,, and what kind of family into environment,
,,, they can live in so there's a story,
,,, behind that idea it's practical it also,
Js7-OWd19PE85,22.34,22.45, speaks to a human need right so that's,Structure
,,, the kind of story you want to bring,
,,, forth but the rehabilitation process or,
,,, what happens when the person is looking,
,,, to have their grocery delivered is,
,,, something that will affect their,
Js7-OWd19PE86,22.48,23.04, personal story and ultimately their,No
,,, happiness and their well-being and their,
,,, enjoyment of life because ultimately all,
,,, of this stuff we're doing in business is,
,,, to make life a little easier let's face,
,,, it it's not easy to live on planet Earth,
Js7-OWd19PE87,23.07,23.19, sometimes right it's a little bit,No
,,, challenging so in order to make life a,
,,, little easier and to deal with the,
,,, conflicts of life business create,
,,, solutions when it's inspired through the,
,,, innovations that are represented by the,
Js7-OWd19PE88,23.22,23.34, minds of the people sitting in this room,No
,,, now there is something else I want to,
,,, mention about a business pitches and,
,,, presentations and it's this it's very,
,,, important to be able to know how to read,
,,, the moment and read the room which means,
Js7-OWd19PE89,23.38,23.49, sensing your audience sensing what they,No
,,, are thinking sensing what they're,
,,, feeling what they might wish that you,
,,, would be talking about what their,
,,, thoughts and reactions are being able to,
,,, read somebody's body language or even if,
Js7-OWd19PE90,23.51,24.03, there's a tension in the room or there's,No
,,, a calmness in the room the presenter,
,,, needs to be able to sense that and if,
,,, you're making a video presentation and,
,,, your pitch is in a film and voiceover,
,,, format we have to be sensing even in,
Js7-OWd19PE91,24.06,24.18, that format what read the audience who,Structure
,,, are these people and what might they be,
,,, interested in that's part of it,
,,, obviously how many of you here have made,
,,, a business pitch already I just like to,
,,, see a show of hands you've already,
Js7-OWd19PE92,24.19,24.32, created a business how many of you,No
,,, have ever given a presentation on a,
,,, particular idea or subject or topic that,
,,, you care about terrific how many of you,
,,, are here for a different reason you,
,,, haven't done either of those two things,
Js7-OWd19PE93,24.34,24.48, anybody what's the reason that you're,No
,,, here learning fantastic number one thing,
,,, about any activity don't forget the,
,,, learning and don't forget the fun right,
,,, we have to make sure business can be,
,,, very serious stuff there's also an,
Js7-OWd19PE94,24.51,25, element of fun that has to be conveyed,Structure
,,, in the presentation and I mean that in,
,,, all seriousness if we're not having fun,
,,, with these pitches and with these ideas,
,,, then there's something missing and it,
,,, won't be conveyed connecting with your,
Js7-OWd19PE95,25.04,25.21, audience is incredibly important and let,Structure
,,, me fill this idea out a little bit when,
,,, I speak to you if I'm not making a,
,,, connection and I'm not engaging your,
,,, story then my story will be lost what,
,,, I'm trying to say because people want to,
Js7-OWd19PE96,25.24,25.38, feel validated for what they already,No
,,, feel and they want to feel engaged so,
,,, it's very very very important that we,
,,, engage people's stories and that we use,
,,, story but we tell a story through our,
,,, presentation so that when the listener,
Js7-OWd19PE97,25.41,25.54, is interacting with it they feel like,No
,,, they've been brought into a story that,
,,, we have invited them into and the story,
,,, is part of what the hook is about right,
,,, the ability to tell the story and make,
,,, people feel like they're part of the,
Js7-OWd19PE98,25.55,26.08, story instead of making them feel like,No
,,, they're targets targets where we see,
,,, them as having something we want and,
,,, want to get something from you that's,
,,, not telling a story your ATAR you have,
,,, money I need your money so let me tell,
Js7-OWd19PE99,26.1,26.23, you what I need from you and give it to,No
,,, me no it's a story there has to be a,
,,, collaboration I know guys I know a lot,
,,, of people men and women who are their,
,,, passion in life quite frankly is to give,
,,, money to promising ideas they've,
Js7-OWd19PE100,26.26,26.39, succeeded in their in their businesses,No
,,, and their industries and now what they,
,,, want to do is help grow other ideas and,
,,, when I talk to them these are people who,
,,, have accomplished something already they,
,,, are very confident in what their,
Js7-OWd19PE101,26.41,26.52, abilities are and sometimes they feel,No
,,, like there was something more they,
,,, needed to do with their life there might,
,,, be a passion they had that they didn't,
,,, fulfill their might be that they were,
,,, very interested in let's say I don't,
Js7-OWd19PE102,26.56,27.07, know sports but they went off into a,No
,,, business direction so then somebody,
,,, comes to them with an idea a startup,
,,, that has to do with something about,
,,, measuring the heartbeat when somebody is,
,,, working out or being able to be aware of,
Js7-OWd19PE103,27.1,27.21, all of your medical data when you're,No
,,, working out or something else about,
,,, sports a sneaker design sports shoe,
,,, design that really helps give ultimate,
,,, performance when I talk to my colleagues,
,,, and friends who are investors and who,
Js7-OWd19PE104,27.23,27.38, look to help people and contribute they,No
,,, tell me that what they're looking for,
,,, most when somebody gives a presentation,
,,, is they're looking to see something in,
,,, that person that reminds them of the,
,,, passion they had when they first started,
Js7-OWd19PE105,27.4,27.54, their idea so they go back into their,Structure
,,, own story they want to feel like they,
,,, can help somebody else grow an idea the,
,,, way they did and they want to feel like,
,,, they could become an important partner,
,,, in that person's life so the story is,
Js7-OWd19PE106,27.57,28.08, incredibly important I had one friend,No
,,, say to me oh you know I heard a,
,,, presentation and he just he just gave me,
,,, like an avalanche how do you say,
,,, avalanche in Spanish like when they're,
,,, the mountain lunched okay there you go,
Js7-OWd19PE107,28.11,28.24, good an avalanche of data and statistics,Structure
,,, and bottom line and he said look I'm a,
,,, money person so of course I want to know,
,,, all of that he said but I didn't need,
,,, seventy percent of the presentation to,
,,, be pouring that on my head I walked away,
Js7-OWd19PE108,28.27,28.38, and I didn't even know who these people,Structure
,,, are why they care what what makes them,
,,, get up in the morning and go do this how,
,,, has this impacted their family where did,
,,, they get the idea in the first place,
,,, right somebody in the challenge we were,
Js7-OWd19PE109,28.41,28.54, just doing now so I got this idea,No
,,, because a family member I had had his,
,,, car stolen and it made me think of this,
,,, technology that would be a locking,
,,, system in the car but right away that's,
,,, a personal offer that says hey something,
Js7-OWd19PE110,28.56,29.09, intimate happened to me and I want to,No
,,, help people who have that experience so,
,,, finding a way to poke people in through,
,,, the story is very very important putting,
,,, yourself in the other person's shoes is,
,,, also very important and remembering that,
Js7-OWd19PE111,29.13,29.29, if you're giving a presentation that is,Structure
,,, in the moment and your audience isn't,
,,, saying very much to you what is a very,
,,, natural tendency is to tell is to begin,
,,, to imagine i should say that you know,
,,, what they're thinking have you ever had,
Js7-OWd19PE112,29.32,29.41, that happen where you're standing in,No
,,, front of people and they're not saying,
,,, something back and so then you start to,
,,, make up a story about what you think,
,,, they're thinking anybody have that,
,,, happen yes and have you ever made up a,
Js7-OWd19PE113,29.45,29.58, story that sounds something like oh they,No
,,, might be bored this isn't connecting,
,,, anybody have that thought oh wow I'm,
,,, really right now what I'm saying this,
,,, really this this really isn't going well,
,,, that they really think this this is no,
Js7-OWd19PE114,30,30.17, good that is what we call the inner,Structure
,,, story remember that everybody has an,
,,, inner story and an outer story and the,
,,, inner story is made up of our thoughts,
,,, feelings and ideas some of which are,
,,, coming from raw primitive emotion and,
Js7-OWd19PE115,30.21,30.33, what we call it in acting is the inner,No
,,, critic does anyone here know what the,
,,, inner critic is you hear that expression,
,,, before,
,,, you're saying yes how do you define the,
,,, inner critic I know you know what it is,
Js7-OWd19PE116,30.39,31.17, yes yes yes in one sentence I'm going to,No
,,, say it in Spanish okay ya es auto,
,,, kritika o se cuando estÇ­ en frente a la,
,,, you DNC a'ight empiezas a question our,
,,, todo lo que tu haces if if someone could,
,,, help me to translate that in English,
Js7-OWd19PE117,31.19,31.41, that would be good for you see translate,No
,,, a quick that sentence yes yes and the,
,,, inner critic even goes a step beyond,
,,, that it's that self-questioning,
,,, self-doubting and you know it's the,
,,, inner critic when it starts to tell you,
Js7-OWd19PE118,31.43,31.54, you're no good you're you're making a,No
,,, mess of things it's terrible what you,
,,, said people don't like you how dare you,
,,, get up there you don't know what you're,
,,, doing you shouldn't really be doing this,
,,, because you don't really have any skill,
Js7-OWd19PE119,31.56,32.07, at this they think you're a fool they,No
,,, look stupid you look stupid you look too,
,,, fat you look too thin you look too smart,
,,, you don't look smart enough it's all,
,,, those toxic messages that go in the,
,,, brain and that sit there and activate us,
Js7-OWd19PE120,32.1,32.23, some of us have an inner critic that,Structure
,,, shows up before others during others,
,,, after a big event why am i bringing this,
,,, up I'm bringing this up because if we,
,,, don't have a strong relationship to,
,,, knowing how to manage our inner critic,
Js7-OWd19PE121,32.25,32.39, that internal story is going to bleed,Structure
,,, into the outer story that we're trying,
,,, to say the inner critic will say don't,
,,, say anything so we'll be quiet or it'll,
,,, make a second guess every word we say,
,,, and then,
Js7-OWd19PE122,32.4,32.54, we will be very kind of awkward in our,No
,,, speech because we're hearing something,
,,, say yeah that word no not that word yep,
,,, not that word can you imagine by the,
,,, time you go to speak right why is this,
,,, essential you tell me why is it,
Js7-OWd19PE123,32.56,33.11, essential why am i coming here to say to,Structure
,,, you in order to create a vibrant,
,,, influential persuasive business pitch,
,,, and presentation we need to be able to,
,,, manage our inner critic why am I saying,
,,, that make the connection you tell me why,
Js7-OWd19PE124,33.15,33.37, is this important yes yes I think you,No
,,, were going to say something yes you know,
,,, you you yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what do,
,,, you what do you think is important about,
,,, that exactly see I love that you just,
,,, went right to the heart because it's,
Js7-OWd19PE125,33.41,33.56, very practical if we're not paying,No
,,, attention to the inner critic who are we,
,,, paying attention to the audience if I'm,
,,, all caught up in worrying about how do I,
,,, look how do I sound did I sound smart do,
,,, I sound like I have enough intelligence,
Js7-OWd19PE126,33.57,34.08, do they like me do they like me do they,No
,,, like me which is maybe on a baby level,
,,, what's underneath everything the inner,
,,, critic is saying do they like me and,
,,, what's my reputation going to be when I,
,,, finish are they going to think I'm okay,
Js7-OWd19PE127,34.09,34.23, if I'm not worried about that I have the,No
,,, time and the space and the energy to,
,,, care about you to care about the,
,,, audience to care about the person i'm,
,,, making the pitch to so this is,
,,, incredibly important i work with people,
Js7-OWd19PE128,34.25,34.38, who are in industries I work with CEOs I,No
,,, work with people who are in the,
,,, Performing Arts I've worked with actors,
,,, who work on Broadway and who tell me you,
,,, know what I'm an actor i have training,
,,, and the hardest thing for me to do is to,
Js7-OWd19PE129,34.4,34.51, stand spontaneously and talk let's say,No
,,, to the press or when I'm being,
,,, interviewed about something,
,,, spontaneously somebody sees me on the,
,,, street and it's a spontaneous grab we,
,,, call it it's a,
Js7-OWd19PE130,34.52,35.03, RAB conversation or somebody now I have,No
,,, to talk about something and these are,
,,, people that are trained to be on stage,
,,, so can you imagine the people who aren't,
,,, trained to be on stage and it is all the,
,,, same it's kind of there's a democracy,
Js7-OWd19PE131,35.05,35.15, there's an egalitarian quality to this,No
,,, it doesn't matter one status one's,
,,, wealth it doesn't matter family,
,,, background cultural background where you,
,,, were born in the world how much money,
,,, you have and how much fame or whether,
Js7-OWd19PE132,35.18,35.33, you work as a janitor everybody deals,No
,,, with those inner critic self-doubts the,
,,, smart leaders are leaders who understand,
,,, two things and you're a leader when,
,,, you're making a presentation number one,
,,, in order to be effective I need to know,
Js7-OWd19PE133,35.36,35.48, myself I need to know when my inner,No
,,, critic shows up maybe it shows up before,
,,, during or after the event and I need to,
,,, find a way to do either self coaching or,
,,, get coaching to help me with that,
,,, because if it shows up before I'm not,
Js7-OWd19PE134,35.5,36.03, going to deliver my message clearly it's,No
,,, going to it's going to stop me from what,
,,, I want to say if it happens during I'm,
,,, going to come across as less confident,
,,, less confident if it happens after I,
,,, won't be able to enjoy my success which,
Js7-OWd19PE135,36.06,36.17, is what happens very often as some of,No
,,, you are smiling exactly you know what I,
,,, mean the second thing the leader,
,,, understands is that it's not enough to,
,,, just know oneself we have to understand,
,,, the other person too because they may be,
Js7-OWd19PE136,36.19,36.29, having the same thing happen and that's,Structure
,,, how we build strong teams by the way,
,,, this isn't a team conversation that's,
,,, not what this presentation is about,
,,, today i will just say to you how many,
,,, people here work in teams all right it's,
Js7-OWd19PE137,36.33,36.44, a collaborative world now right it's a,No
,,, collaborative world now baby there's no,
,,, more just the individual right we need,
,,, to be able to interface with people that,
,,, are around the world people that are in,
,,, different areas and it's all about the,
Js7-OWd19PE138,36.47,37, team if I really want to have a very,No
,,, collaborative team I need to be able to,
,,, anticipate what are the inner critics,
,,, even of my other teammates and how can I,
,,, help them feel more confident and grow,
,,, them,
Js7-OWd19PE139,37,37.21, and back to the presentation and pitch,Structure
,,, piece remember that we can plan we can,
,,, have a specific agenda and we can have,
,,, everything laid out even in the video or,
,,, the PowerPoint or the live presentation,
,,, we need to learn how to prepare for the,
Js7-OWd19PE140,37.26,37.39, unexpected to be ready for the,No
,,, unexpected to be ready for the fact that,
,,, this PowerPoint slides don't work,
,,, because somehow the cable is frayed at,
,,, the end it's broken can't use the,
,,, powerpoint what do you do now this,
Js7-OWd19PE141,37.41,37.54, happened to somebody I know recently who,No
,,, is giving a talk in a company I was at,
,,, he said I froze his hands got very wet,
,,, his mouth was dry he's I didn't know,
,,, what to say I said well you know your,
,,, material right he's I know I lost every,
Js7-OWd19PE142,37.57,38.1, thought in my mind so we have to almost,No
,,, go into the moment expecting that we,
,,, don't have everything we think we'll,
,,, need and always have a back-up plan,
,,, always have a plan B and a Plan C in,
,,, case plan B doesn't work you need we,
Js7-OWd19PE143,38.14,38.28, need to know our ideas well enough so,No
,,, that you could pitch your idea alone,
,,, with one other person with only a candle,
,,, for your light in the middle of a desert,
,,, where there's no no food and no water,
,,, right though you can't depend on,
Js7-OWd19PE144,38.31,38.41, anything and it's just you in that human,No
,,, being and of course I'm saying that with,
,,, humor and I also mean it seriously so,
,,, have a back-up plan feel comfortable,
,,, enough that you don't have to rely on,
,,, the technology that you're going to be,
Js7-OWd19PE145,38.42,38.58, utilizing now as far as the video,No
,,, presentations I want to make some points,
,,, about that everything is created in,
,,, video and in the audio applications that,
,,, are utilized like voiceover and,
,,, certainly any music nowadays at a very,
Js7-OWd19PE146,39.01,39.12, high level okay what we're watching,No
,,, online has become increasingly,
,,, sophisticated if we look at what was put,
,,, on the internet,
,,, are on the web we used to call it right,
,,, in 1998 1999 our 2000 it we have very,
Js7-OWd19PE147,39.17,39.28, different quality visually than what we,No
,,, see today right things have really,
,,, changed so that means that we all have,
,,, to up our game in terms of the visual,
,,, material that we put out online because,
,,, there's a lot of competition and,
Js7-OWd19PE148,39.29,39.42, competing imagery for us to look at so,No
,,, in terms of video a couple of things are,
,,, very important that I want to mention,
,,, make sure you don't spread your budget,
,,, dollars too thin to try to do too many,
,,, fancy things in video and then therefore,
Js7-OWd19PE149,39.44,40, sacrifice the basic quality of the video,No
,,, as well as its accessibility to the user,
,,, make sure it's downloadable effectively,
,,, across platforms make sure that it is,
,,, clear in varying kinds of devices mobile,
,,, devices you know about the transition,
Js7-OWd19PE150,40.02,40.12, that's happening now in terms of,No
,,, websites and Google and and android,
,,, phones and and phones have to now be the,
,,, websites have to be designed so that,
,,, they are applicable to phones this is a,
,,, big deal people are using these devices,
Js7-OWd19PE151,40.14,40.27, to view most of the data that's coming,No
,,, in this is number one it's very,
,,, important so rather than spending your,
,,, dollars on something else that has to be,
,,, essential secondly the visual imagery in,
,,, Hollywood there's somebody called the,
Js7-OWd19PE152,40.31,40.43, cinematographer and the designer there's,No
,,, a designer who looks at everything,
,,, visual that comes across that screen now,
,,, when we're at working in startups and we,
,,, have low budgets we can't afford to go,
,,, buy some designer who might be have a,
Js7-OWd19PE153,40.46,41, higher salary than my entire project,No
,,, right what we can do however is think,
,,, smart a we can find people we know who,
,,, have a visual sense to help us,
,,, especially if we tend to be engineers,
,,, how many engineers are in the room hello,
Js7-OWd19PE154,41.03,41.17, I love working with engineers obviously,No
,,, I spend a lot of time at MIT so I love,
,,, working with engineers and many of you,
,,, have a very strong design sense who here,
,,, is in the design aspect who does,
,,, design working in various graphic,
Js7-OWd19PE155,41.21,41.33, formats anybody here working software,No
,,, and and implementing the code anybody,
,,, working code so I'm mentioning all these,
,,, different skill basis because I know,
,,, that some of us have more or less,
,,, strength in terms of seeing the visual,
Js7-OWd19PE156,41.35,41.47, design seeing the visual design is not,No
,,, unlike being able to feel the,
,,, relationship with the person because,
,,, design is sending like you said body,
,,, talk or body language design and visual,
,,, images are sending a signal to the,
Js7-OWd19PE157,41.49,41.59, people in the audience so if you're,No
,,, trying to tell something somebody,
,,, something very important but behind you,
,,, you have an image that makes people,
,,, laugh then you're going to be having a,
,,, cacophony an argument between what,
Js7-OWd19PE158,42.01,42.12, you're saying and the visual behind you,No
,,, so find people who can help you work,
,,, with that visual keep it simple keep it,
,,, clear and in connection to what I said,
,,, about the hook in the beginning with,
,,, your words and what you say your hook,
Js7-OWd19PE159,42.15,42.28, has to be simple clear get to the point,Structure
,,, and as Lee said at the very beginning,
,,, make sure you get to the hook right away,
,,, don't spend your first time your first,
,,, precious moments leading up to a big,
,,, introduction remember this people form,
Js7-OWd19PE160,42.32,42.49, an impression of you your pitch and your,No
,,, idea within the first five to ten,
,,, seconds ten seconds I already have an,
,,, impression of you sometimes one second,
,,, there is actually a video application,
,,, that is online that helps people look at,
Js7-OWd19PE161,42.52,43.05, our internal biases against certain,No
,,, races I actually did it it's a very,
,,, powerful thing I don't remember the name,
,,, of it right now but if you want it email,
,,, me and I'll get it and what it shows is,
,,, very fast images and you have to,
Js7-OWd19PE162,43.08,43.19, immediately click something according to,Structure
,,, your response to what you see and it,
,,, helps you understand if you have any,
,,, internalize biases or biases against,
,,, people who are from African American,
,,, descent in the case of what i was,
Js7-OWd19PE163,43.21,43.35, looking at or people from other cultures,No
,,, and this is happening very very very,
,,, fast so we form an impression and our,
,,, intern,
,,, all judgment is affected and activated,
,,, often within a second because this thing,
Js7-OWd19PE164,43.37,43.5, i was looking at in this application was,No
,,, less than a second very fast so when,
,,, you're giving your pitch make sure you,
,,, don't waste those opening moments and,
,,, give people time to let their mind,
,,, wander or make an impression about you,
Js7-OWd19PE165,43.52,44.03, and put you in a box that has nothing to,Structure
,,, do with who you are but rather that box,
,,, might be a reflection of the fact that,
,,, you are a little nervous about starting,
,,, and you didn't want to seem rude come,
,,, right out there with the hook now I want,
Js7-OWd19PE166,44.05,44.16, to just pause before I go on and say,Structure
,,, this sometimes mistakes happen where,
,,, people think I mean you have to be out,
,,, there and in their face and really,
,,, selling it from the beginning and,
,,, hooking because you know you hear the,
Js7-OWd19PE167,44.18,44.34, word hook and you think of fishing right,No
,,, and you want to throw the hook out and,
,,, grab the fish no it's not aggressive or,
,,, hook is something soft that happens in a,
,,, very human way that makes a person stop,
,,, and pay attention I say soft because,
Js7-OWd19PE168,44.38,44.51, what I mean is if it comes to sharp the,Structure
,,, hook it can actually push the person,
,,, back so you want to make that hook,
,,, something that feels like an invitation,
,,, that makes the person want to say oh,
,,, yeah I'd like to dialogue with you about,
Js7-OWd19PE169,44.54,45.05, that as I said a moment ago the word,No
,,, dialogue right and getting back to the,
,,, video and the production values which is,
,,, really what I'm talking about now we,
,,, have to make sure we're looking at the,
,,, production values of whatever we're,
Js7-OWd19PE170,45.07,45.19, creating in these business pitch pieces,No
,,, that we have because production values,
,,, are crucial and I mean you know the,
,,, quality of the sound the quality of the,
,,, visual and the quality of also the,
,,, actors remember this have any of you,
Js7-OWd19PE171,45.23,45.38, used voiceover an audio where somebody,No
,,, is speaking in your pitches raise your,
,,, hand if you have yes remember this the,
,,, voice-over is essential voiceover is an,
,,, art it is an art form that requires,
,,, training it isn't acting actually what,
Js7-OWd19PE172,45.4,45.57, we call it now is voice artists or,No
,,, actors I do voiceover where my voice is,
,,, used in narrations for museums you know,
,,, I might go and work at a ficial,
,,, institution and I am speaking the words,
,,, of the product that they are trying to,
Js7-OWd19PE173,45.58,46.11, promote or it could be anywhere could be,No
,,, television commercial and people who are,
,,, trained in this art will tell you two,
,,, things the first part of it is this in,
,,, voiceover you never try to sound like,
,,, you're an authority you try to speak to,
Js7-OWd19PE174,46.14,46.27, the human being that's in front of you,No
,,, everything I just said and the second,
,,, thing is voiceover is not something that,
,,, you can learn in a day or an hour and,
,,, sometimes the person who has the idea,
,,, for the project and the person who has,
Js7-OWd19PE175,46.3,46.4, the startup baby that you've been,No
,,, holding in your belly you know being,
,,, pregt with for all these years and,
,,, now you're giving birth even though you,
,,, love the project you may not be the best,
,,, person to do the voiceover because you,
Js7-OWd19PE176,46.43,46.56, may not have that training so this is,Structure
,,, called knowing how to grow a team to,
,,, give the opportunity for somebody else,
,,, to complete you as a leader at Sloan,
,,, there is a professor called Deborah,
,,, ancona who talks about the notion of the,
Js7-OWd19PE178,46.58,47.17, incomplete leader and the incomplete,Structure
,,, leader says I know that I don't have all,
,,, the tools and skills I don't have every,
,,, single quality perfectly developed and,
,,, so what I do now I have to do is find,
,,, people who can help to complete what is,
,,, missing so find people who can be very,
,,, effective in helping you to deliver the,
,,, product in the best possible quality,
3ozZnT72XbM1,0,0.17, g'day everybody patrick here,No
,,, um today we are going to,
,,, talk about sign posting language,
,,, sign posting language,
,,, and you can see here on the screen,
,,, um you know i'm on a website,
3ozZnT72XbM2,0.21,0.39, uh called ielts buddy,No
,,, and uh that's obviously a website,
,,, dedicated,
,,, to prepare to prepare the students,
,,, for ielts exams but this sign posting,
,,, language is not only important for,
3ozZnT72XbM3,0.42,1.04, ielts it's important for any exam,No
,,, any writing text,
,,, any writing piece that you are producing,
,,, but mainly we hear about sign posting,
,,, when we give presentations,
,,, or lectures okay,
3ozZnT72XbM4,1.08,1.23, presentations or lectures when you are,No
,,, giving a lecture or giving a,
,,, presentation to a,
,,, group of people an audience,
,,, it's very important to use sign posting,
,,, language and let me explain,
3ozZnT72XbM5,1.26,1.46, what sign posting language is,No
,,, so sign posting anyway,
,,, is what you do,
,,, to make sure that the listener,
,,, knows what you are talking about,
,,, and what will you be talking about,
3ozZnT72XbM6,1.5,2.09, imagine a little child,No
,,, right imagine well actually,
,,, imagine a father or a mother,
,,, or an adult holding the hand,
,,, of a child while walking in the street,
,,, if you don't hold the child's hand,
3ozZnT72XbM7,2.13,2.26, the child might get,No
,,, lost and so just,
,,, understanding that is very important for,
,,, you,
,,, because there's a connection between,
,,, this image of you holding as an adult,
3ozZnT72XbM8,2.29,2.45, you holding the hand of a child so,No
,,, the child will not get lost,
,,, strong connection between this image and,
,,, and that,
,,, of a presenter or a lecturer,
,,, using sign post,
3ozZnT72XbM9,2.49,3.08, right to help the audience,No
,,, stay attentive and not get lost,
,,, if you don't use signed posting language,
,,, your audience might just,
,,, get lost and you cannot,
,,, find them again then you end up talking,
3ozZnT72XbM10,3.12,3.26, and talking and talking and they,No
,,, are completely sleeping okay,
,,, they probably doze off they'll take a,
,,, nap,
,,, all right and they will probably lose,
,,, interest they lose interest,
3ozZnT72XbM11,3.29,3.42, and you cannot afford that when you are,No
,,, giving a talk,
,,, when you are delivering a presentation,
,,, or a lecture of any kind,
,,, you cannot take that risk you need to,
,,, make sure,
3ozZnT72XbM12,3.44,3.58, that your audience is always,No
,,, always attentive that means,
,,, paying attention and listening to you,
,,, and,
,,, is aware your audience is aware,
,,, of what you are going to talk about,
3ozZnT72XbM13,4.01,4.14, what you just talked about and what will,No
,,, you be,
,,, talking about okay all these things are,
,,, very important and that's what sign,
,,, posting language is,
,,, okay so this,
3ozZnT72XbM14,4.17,4.29, article here and i'm going to include,No
,,, the link to the article,
,,, on the screen it's good for you to read,
,,, it,
,,, don't worry that it's saying it's saying,
,,, that this is important for ielts well,
3ozZnT72XbM15,4.3,4.41, it's not only important for ielts it's,No
,,, important for,
,,, any talk that you give and even it's,
,,, important in writing,
,,, and in speaking not only in speaking,
,,, okay,
3ozZnT72XbM16,4.42,4.57, so but i would like to uh walk you,Structure
,,, through,
,,, some of the main sentences,
,,, or main phrases that,
,,, you can use when you are,
,,, delivering a presentation about anything,
3ozZnT72XbM17,5,5.1, all right so pay attention as we go,Structure
,,, through the list,
,,, because i'm going to give you some,
,,, examples as well you know we're going to,
,,, pick,
,,, a topic for the presentation and,
3ozZnT72XbM18,5.14,5.25, i'm going to be using the signed posting,No
,,, language,
,,, with that topic all right so,
,,, so i'm not going to give you a,
,,, presentation about this topic but,
,,, i'm going to use this topic as an,
3ozZnT72XbM19,5.27,5.39, example,No
,,, when i read the phrases for you the sign,
,,, posting language,
,,, okay so like,
,,, anything else in english you know in the,
,,, academic world like anything else,
3ozZnT72XbM20,5.43,6.02, we have an introduction,Structure
,,, we have a body and we have a conclusion,
,,, we have a body and we have a conclusion,
,,, presentations are not different okay,
,,, presentations and lectures,
,,, have the same characteristics they have,
,,, an,
3ozZnT72XbM21,6.03,6.14, introduction they have a body and they,Structure
,,, have a conclusion,
,,, so the first thing that you do when you,
,,, actually,
,,, open up a presentation when you start a,
,,, presentation,
3ozZnT72XbM22,6.15,6.31, the first thing you do is you introduce,No
,,, the topic of your presentation,
,,, okay so in other words for example you,
,,, say,
,,, today we're going to talk about,
,,, today we're going to talk about see,
3ozZnT72XbM23,6.34,6.48, talk is the key word today we're going,No
,,, to talk about,
,,, and now because you have about,
,,, you need to actually have a noun,
,,, after it you cannot use a verb,
,,, you can use a gerund or you can use,
3ozZnT72XbM24,6.52,7.03, a noun any noun but you have to use a,No
,,, noun,
,,, so for example you can say today we're,
,,, going to talk about,
,,, the greatest challenges of,
,,, international students studying in,
3ozZnT72XbM25,7.05,7.18, australia,Structure
,,, here you go that's a topic right,
,,, so i opened my presentation,
,,, the first thing i did i introduced a,
,,, topic,
,,, to my audience i'm telling my audience,
3ozZnT72XbM26,7.21,7.38, what the topic of the presentation,Structure
,,, is going to be i can say the topic of,
,,, today's lecture is,
,,, so now i need to add after is,
,,, the topic of today's lecture is,
,,, the struggles the struggles of,
3ozZnT72XbM27,7.41,7.55, international students in australia okay,No
,,, so i'm not using only the word,
,,, challenges,
,,, i'm also using the word struggles,
,,, just to show you that you can you can,
,,, find,
3ozZnT72XbM28,7.56,8.06, synonyms and you have to use,No
,,, synonyms you cannot keep repeating the,
,,, same word,
,,, throughout the presentation you have to,
,,, use,
,,, synonyms there are many ways to say,
3ozZnT72XbM29,8.1,8.21, the same idea or the same concept,Structure
,,, so we say the topic of today's lecture,
,,, is,
,,, the challenges or the struggles of,
,,, international students,
,,, in australia or this morning,
3ozZnT72XbM30,8.24,8.36, we're going to take a look at this,No
,,, morning,
,,, we're going to take a look at we're,
,,, going to take a look at,
,,, and then now you need to use a,
,,, noun again because you have at okay you,
3ozZnT72XbM31,8.39,8.53, have at,No
,,, at is a preposition look at,
,,, looking at is a phrasal verb so look,
,,, at look at and now i need to say,
,,, i have to say a noun i have to use a,
,,, noun so i can say this morning,
3ozZnT72XbM32,8.55,9.09, we're gonna take a look at uh some of,No
,,, the challenges,
,,, faced by international students in,
,,, australia,
,,, okay so uh you can see how i,
,,, change how i word,
3ozZnT72XbM33,9.12,9.31, my topic there's not only one way,No
,,, to articulate the topic you can use,
,,, many different ways to express the same,
,,, thought to express the same topic,
,,, okay next today i'll be talking about,
,,, or i'll be discussing today i'll be,
3ozZnT72XbM34,9.34,9.46, talking about,No
,,, i'll be discussing what are you going to,
,,, be discussing let's say,
,,, today i'll be talking about or,
,,, discussing the challenges that,
,,, international students encounter in,
3ozZnT72XbM35,9.5,10.06, australia,No
,,, oh this time i didn't say face i said,
,,, encounter encounter,
,,, that means face when you face a problem,
,,, you encounter a problem you encounter,
,,, a problem you encounter a problem,
3ozZnT72XbM36,10.09,10.22, okay so talking about discussing,No
,,, same meaning you can say either,
,,, next what i'm going to talk about today,
,,, what i'm going to be,
,,, what i'm going to be talking about today,
,,, what i'm going to be talking about today,
3ozZnT72XbM37,10.25,10.38, do you see how i say going to i say,No
,,, gonna,
,,, it's okay to use gonna we,
,,, i don't encourage you to use gonna,
,,, in academic uh,
,,, talks right it's better not to use,
3ozZnT72XbM38,10.41,10.5, that kind of language but but it's fine,No
,,, i heard it from,
,,, professors i heard it from teachers,
,,, people,
,,, use it without actually being conscious,
,,, of it so i would not,
3ozZnT72XbM39,10.52,11.04, think it's a big deal right so what i'm,Structure
,,, going to be talking about today,
,,, is the many challenges international,
,,, students,
,,, face in australia and how they can,
,,, overcome them here you go now you are,
3ozZnT72XbM40,11.07,11.21, actually adding to that you're not not,Structure
,,, only are you going to talk about,
,,, the challenges you're also going to be,
,,, touching on or you know mentioning,
,,, some of the solutions to those,
,,, challenges or problems,
3ozZnT72XbM41,11.24,11.38, the purpose of today's lecture is the,No
,,, purpose of today's lecture is,
,,, is to is to now we have two here right,
,,, we have two,
,,, so the purpose of today's lecture is to,
,,, okay so if i say is two i have to use,
3ozZnT72XbM42,11.42,11.55, a verb now after two okay,Structure
,,, the purpose of today's lecture is to,
,,, shed light on,
,,, shed light on shed light on,
,,, shed light on some of the difficulties,
,,, international students,
3ozZnT72XbM43,11.57,12.13, face in australia when you shed light on,Structure
,,, something,
,,, when you shed light on something you,
,,, are providing more information,
,,, about something so that means,
,,, something is not,
3ozZnT72XbM44,12.16,12.27, very very clear to people,No
,,, maybe there's darkness about it that's,
,,, why i shed light on,
,,, if you shed light on that means maybe,
,,, this area does not receive a lot of,
,,, attention,
3ozZnT72XbM45,12.28,12.4, this area does not receive a lot of,Structure
,,, attention,
,,, and and therefore you are shedding light,
,,, you are providing,
,,, more information more knowledge,
,,, about the topic the subject,
3ozZnT72XbM46,12.44,12.56, or the topic of my talk is so now you're,Structure
,,, about to,
,,, simply read the title of the topic,
,,, what is the title of the presentation,
,,, and the subtitle,
,,, title and subtitle and i would say that,
3ozZnT72XbM47,12.58,13.12, can be something like,Structure
,,, the subject or the topic of my talk is,
,,, international students are dois,
,,, arduous arduous that means it takes a,
,,, lot of effort and,
,,, a lot of hard work okay so international,
3ozZnT72XbM48,13.15,13.32, students are jewish journey,No
,,, in australia and that's the topic,
,,, of your presentation the first,
,,, thing you do is you introduce,
,,, your topic to your audience so they know,
,,, why they are sitting there listening to,
3ozZnT72XbM49,13.35,13.47, you,Structure
,,, what are you about to speak about what,
,,, are you about,
,,, to discuss with them okay what,
,,, are you about to shed light on,
,,, that's the main thing okay and then,
3ozZnT72XbM50,13.51,14.04, the next stage of your presentation,Structure
,,, should be,
,,, telling your audience what the structure,
,,, of your talk is going to be what the,
,,, structure,
,,, of the presentation is going to be,
3ozZnT72XbM51,14.09,14.22, okay so that means now you're going to,Structure
,,, start with something like,
,,, in today's lecture i'm going to cover,
,,, three points but you know,
,,, we're not only talking about points we,
,,, are talking about,
3ozZnT72XbM52,14.23,14.38, something more specific in this topic,Structure
,,, we're talking about,
,,, challenges that students,
,,, encounter while studying in australia,
,,, so i will see i'm not going to say,
,,, points i'm going to say,
3ozZnT72XbM53,14.4,14.55, three challenges and maybe i might add,Structure
,,, something so in today's lecture,
,,, i'm going to cover three great,
,,, challenges international students,
,,, face or encounter or,
,,, struggle to overcome alright see i there,
3ozZnT72XbM54,14.58,15.12, are different ways to do it,Structure
,,, alright so you can see i'm going to,
,,, divide i'm going to divide this talk,
,,, into three parts,
,,, okay i'm going to divide this talk,
,,, into three parts and then you can say,
3ozZnT72XbM55,15.15,15.29, and each part will be looking at a,Structure
,,, difficult,
,,, challenge okay,
,,, now so what you did here you actually,
,,, divided that means you split you divided,
,,, you,
3ozZnT72XbM56,15.3,15.45, you you you cut,Structure
,,, your presentation into three parts you,
,,, are telling,
,,, the audience to expect hearing,
,,, about three different points,
,,, three different areas three different,
3ozZnT72XbM57,15.48,16.02, challenges three different problems you,Structure
,,, can call them,
,,, whatever you want but now there is that,
,,, structure in the audience's head,
,,, that they know what to expect they have,
,,, an idea,
3ozZnT72XbM58,16.03,16.14, you introduce the topic first and now,Structure
,,, you are telling them that they're going,
,,, to hear,
,,, three challenges they're going to hear,
,,, about three challenges or three,
,,, solutions or three areas or whatever,
3ozZnT72XbM59,16.17,16.3, that may be,Structure
,,, okay the important thing is you are,
,,, being clear,
,,, about what the structure looks like in,
,,, this presentation,
,,, next first we'll look at so you can say,
3ozZnT72XbM60,16.32,16.44, first,Structure
,,, and then and finally,
,,, so this way you are um creating that,
,,, structure in your audience's head that's,
,,, very important,
,,, okay so you can say first we'll look at,
3ozZnT72XbM61,16.48,17.01, um at culture shock that's one challenge,No
,,, that international students face,
,,, so you say first we'll look at culture,
,,, shock,
,,, then we'll go on to talk about the,
,,, difficulties,
3ozZnT72XbM62,17.03,17.17, of learning a foreign language,Structure
,,, and their impact on the student's,
,,, experience,
,,, and finally i'll touch on the ficial,
,,, problems,
,,, and try to offer some solutions to all,
3ozZnT72XbM63,17.2,17.3, three,Structure
,,, challenges so okay so now i'm,
,,, i'm also adding that i will give you an,
,,, idea of,
,,, what some of the solutions might be to,
,,, your problems okay,
3ozZnT72XbM64,17.32,17.44, but so now the audience knows,No
,,, that they expect to hear about the first,
,,, problem,
,,, the second problem and the third problem,
,,, there are only three problems so they,
,,, are ready to hear about,
3ozZnT72XbM65,17.46,17.57, three not four not five but they are,No
,,, ready to hear about,
,,, three problems and they hear uh,
,,, they're waiting to hear about the,
,,, challenges and the solutions at the end,
,,, that you're going to recommend,
3ozZnT72XbM66,18,18.17, to international students so they can,Structure
,,, overcome those challenges okay,
,,, all right so now we've just,
,,, covered right and how you explain the,
,,, structure of your presentation,
,,, to your audience okay,
3ozZnT72XbM67,18.2,18.35, so now we've covered how you can explain,Structure
,,, the structure of your presentation to,
,,, your audience,
,,, now i'd like to move on to um,
,,, to the phrases or the sentences that we,
,,, use,
3ozZnT72XbM68,18.36,18.52, to introduce our first section,Structure
,,, okay so we can start by let's start by,
,,, talking about,
,,, let's start by talking about remember,
,,, if you have about so that's a,
,,, preposition if you have about then you,
3ozZnT72XbM69,18.55,19.04, have to,Structure
,,, use a noun after it so you can say,
,,, something like,
,,, let's start by talking about culture,
,,, shock,
,,, if you remember i said before when i,
3ozZnT72XbM70,19.06,19.19, introduced,Structure
,,, or when i uh rather when i talked about,
,,, the structure of the presentation,
,,, i said that i'll be dividing my talk,
,,, into three parts or three challenges,
,,, okay and then now it's time to introduce,
3ozZnT72XbM71,19.24,19.34, what is the first point and the first,Structure
,,, point,
,,, is culture shock so i'll say let's start,
,,, by talking about culture shock let's,
,,, start,
,,, by talking about culture shock or,
3ozZnT72XbM72,19.38,19.52, to begin to begin,Structure
,,, okay so what do i say to begin let me,
,,, explain,
,,, what a culture shock actually,
,,, is ah so i started,
,,, my first section by defining,
3ozZnT72XbM73,19.55,20.07, the key term of,Structure
,,, my presentation the key term one of the,
,,, key terms,
,,, is culture shock because it's one of the,
,,, challenges,
,,, so now in other words i'm actually,
3ozZnT72XbM74,20.11,20.26, explaining the topic sentence the topic,Structure
,,, sentence,
,,, the the first the key word the key word,
,,, of the first section is culture shock,
,,, so there is no better way to start your,
,,, section your first section and then,
3ozZnT72XbM75,20.29,20.45, defining,Structure
,,, the key term of that section or defining,
,,, the key topic of that section which is,
,,, culture shock so to begin let me explain,
,,, what a culture shock actually,
,,, is or you can say,
3ozZnT72XbM76,20.48,21.07, firstly um i'd like to define the term,No
,,, culture shock firstly i'd like to define,
,,, i'd like i would like i'd like to define,
,,, i'd like to define the term,
,,, culture shock,
,,, which again is very important because,
3ozZnT72XbM77,21.1,21.23, you are,Structure
,,, defining the key term of your topic,
,,, or you can say i'll start with culture,
,,, shock,
,,, simple i'll start with culture shock,
,,, or you can say uh the first challenge,
3ozZnT72XbM78,21.26,21.35, which,No
,,, i'm certain many of you are familiar,
,,, with,
,,, i mean it depends who your audience is,
,,, not all audiences,
,,, are familiar with your topic,
3ozZnT72XbM79,21.38,21.49, so you need to know your audience when,No
,,, you are giving a presentation,
,,, you need to know who you are giving your,
,,, presentation to,
,,, who are you delivering your presentation,
,,, to,
3ozZnT72XbM80,21.5,22.02, how much does your audience know about,No
,,, the topic,
,,, what is the level of their knowledge of,
,,, the topic,
,,, how aware of the topic are they,
,,, so you need to know your audience but,
3ozZnT72XbM81,22.03,22.15, let's assume that your audience knows,No
,,, something about it okay,
,,, so we'll say uh the first challenge,
,,, which i'm certain that means i'm sure,
,,, the first,
,,, challenge which i'm certain many of you,
3ozZnT72XbM82,22.17,22.29, are familiar with,No
,,, is culture shock okay,
,,, so next is um,
,,, you know we're going to talk about,
,,, finishing a section,
,,, all right so now we just we've just seen,
3ozZnT72XbM83,22.32,22.46, how we introduce,Structure
,,, the first section okay,
,,, how you introduce your first section but,
,,, now,
,,, we're going to look at how you finish a,
,,, section so,
3ozZnT72XbM84,22.47,22.58, just like i used the same strategy,No
,,, myself i said,
,,, now you've seen i've talked about,
,,, we've looked at okay we've looked at for,
,,, example,
,,, uh we've looked at culture shock and its,
3ozZnT72XbM85,23.01,23.12, impact on on the students experience in,No
,,, australia,
,,, all right or i've talked about culture,
,,, shock,
,,, and and its impact on the students,
,,, experience,
3ozZnT72XbM86,23.12,23.22, in australia so you that's how you,Structure
,,, finish,
,,, a section right you are finishing you're,
,,, closing,
,,, a section and you're about to open,
,,, another,
3ozZnT72XbM87,23.24,23.35, okay and then when you open another you,No
,,, go back to,
,,, you know secondly or thirdly,
,,, okay and i'm gonna show you now what,
,,, other phrases you can use,
,,, so now you can say let's move on to,
3ozZnT72XbM88,23.39,23.54, let's move on to okay,Structure
,,, let's move on to and what can i say,
,,, let's move on to the problems associated,
,,, with the students english language,
,,, skills,
,,, so remember we started with culture,
3ozZnT72XbM89,23.58,24.1, shock,Structure
,,, now we're going to continue and we're,
,,, going to talk about the second challenge,
,,, so what i said was let's move on to,
,,, the problems associated with,
,,, the students english language uh,
3ozZnT72XbM90,24.14,24.25, skills so that's the second issue that's,No
,,, the second problem,
,,, or you can say now let's turn to,
,,, instead of saying let's move on to you,
,,, can say,
,,, now let's turn to turn to let's turn to,
3ozZnT72XbM91,24.29,24.41, let's turn to the problems associated,Structure
,,, with the students english language,
,,, skills,
,,, if you don't want to say that you can,
,,, say and i'd now like to talk about,
,,, simply okay you can say and i'd now like,
3ozZnT72XbM92,24.44,24.54, to talk about,No
,,, uh problems associated,
,,, with the student's english language,
,,, skills i'm just repeating,
,,, the same phrase or the same sentence,
,,, here that the key thing is to show you,
3ozZnT72XbM93,24.57,25.09, those s the sign posting language,No
,,, that is essential essential you know for,
,,, you,
,,, uh to use in a presentation or any,
,,, academic talk,
,,, okay and you can say,
3ozZnT72XbM94,25.12,25.22, something like the next or,No
,,, second because you said the first thing,
,,, i'm going to talk about,
,,, you know in the previous section you,
,,, said the first thing i'm going to talk,
,,, about,
3ozZnT72XbM95,25.23,25.34, is culture shock now you say,No
,,, the second thing or the next challenge,
,,, the second,
,,, challenge the second challenge and then,
,,, what can you say yeah well,
,,, the the second challenge or the second,
3ozZnT72XbM96,25.36,25.5, greatest challenge,No
,,, uh affecting the experience of,
,,, international students in australia,
,,, is the english language skills,
,,, okay if you don't like saying that you,
,,, can say the next,
3ozZnT72XbM97,25.51,26.04, issue or the next area or the next,No
,,, challenge,
,,, i'd like to focus on is,
,,, okay so the next area the next challenge,
,,, i'd like to focus on,
,,, is learning english as a second language,
3ozZnT72XbM98,26.08,26.27, and the challenges that it poses,No
,,, to international students so here you go,
,,, there are several ways how to express,
,,, the same thought the same idea,
,,, there are many words you can use to,
,,, articulate that okay all right,
3ozZnT72XbM99,26.3,26.48, so now we have looked at how,Structure
,,, you start a new section,
,,, okay and finally,
,,, i'd like to show you some of the phrases,
,,, and those are very common phrases some,
,,, of the phrases we use,
3ozZnT72XbM100,26.51,27.07, right uh to uh to to finish our talk,Structure
,,, to that's for for our conclusion,
,,, all right because i did say before that,
,,, your introduction has,
,,, an introduction has a body and,
,,, a conclusion now that's a conclusion and,
3ozZnT72XbM101,27.11,27.23, i want to,Structure
,,, show you some of the phrases we use,
,,, to conclude our presentation to sum up,
,,, our presentation,
,,, to wrap up we say wrap up our,
,,, presentation,
3ozZnT72XbM102,27.24,27.38, all right wrap up that means finish up,Structure
,,, okay so you can say to sum up,
,,, we have looked at the three greatest,
,,, challenges that international students,
,,, struggle with,
,,, okay for example you can say so it is,
3ozZnT72XbM103,27.41,27.52, clear,Structure
,,, from what we have discussed today that,
,,, blah blah blah blah blah okay i'd like,
,,, now to recap,
,,, and what does recap mean what does,
,,, recap mean when you recap that means,
3ozZnT72XbM104,27.55,28.1, you sum up you conclude,Structure
,,, not conclude you summarize,
,,, all right summarized you are summarizing,
,,, so,
,,, within a minute or two you need to cover,
,,, again repeat the three,
3ozZnT72XbM105,28.13,28.29, challenges that you've spoken about,Structure
,,, throughout the presentation,
,,, now it's time to summarize that,
,,, to recap so you just go over it again,
,,, very quickly okay or you can say let's,
,,, summarize briefly what we've looked at,
3ozZnT72XbM106,28.31,28.46, let's summarize briefly what we've,Structure
,,, looked at,
,,, right or you can say in conclusion,
,,, okay um in conclusion,
,,, there are three big challenges,
,,, that international students encounter,
3ozZnT72XbM107,28.5,29.04, in australia and as we've discussed,No
,,, those are a b and c and the best way to,
,,, handle them,
,,, is by doing a b and c,
,,, the main goal of,
,,, using signed posting language,
3ozZnT72XbM108,29.07,29.27, is to really keep the audience,No
,,, attentive to keep your audience,
,,, aware of everything that you're saying,
,,, okay you are giving them directions,
,,, you are telling them hey,
,,, don't get lost follow me i'm here,
3ozZnT72XbM109,29.31,29.44, i'm showing you the way i'm telling you,No
,,, what i'm talking about,
,,, i'm telling you what the topic is,
,,, i'm introducing to you what i'm going to,
,,, be talking about in my presentation,
,,, i'm going to tell you when i start a new,
3ozZnT72XbM110,29.46,29.58, section i'm going to tell you when i'm,Structure
,,, when i finished a section i'm going to,
,,, tell you when i'm moving on to a new,
,,, section and i'm going to,
,,, summarize all the points that i have,
,,, made,
3ozZnT72XbM111,29.59,30.1, in this presentation to you so if you do,No
,,, that,
,,, then your audience will enjoy listening,
,,, to you,
,,, because they are involved in the,
,,, presentation they know,
3ozZnT72XbM112,30.13,30.27, where you're going every step along the,No
,,, way,
,,, you are holding their hands and you are,
,,, constantly reassuring them,
,,, that uh you are not going too fast,
,,, that you are going to make sure that,
3ozZnT72XbM113,30.29,30.46, they know,No
,,, where you are at every turn,
,,, every section okay so i cannot,
,,, stress enough how important it is to use,
,,, sign posting language okay,
,,, so make sure that you practice those,
3ozZnT72XbM114,30.5,31.02, use them in your presentations use them,No
,,, in your,
,,, lectures use them in any talk that you,
,,, give in an academic setting,
,,, and you can you can probably use a lot,
,,, of them,
3ozZnT72XbM115,31.03,31.14, in your writing as well when you write,No
,,, an essay an opinion essay,
,,, you have to express your own opinion and,
,,, so,
,,, people or the readers would be,
,,, very very glad to see that you,
3ozZnT72XbM116,31.18,31.3, are telling them what you're going to be,Structure
,,, talking about,
,,, in this essay what is the topic of the,
,,, essay,
,,, how is the essay structured how many,
,,, parts,
3ozZnT72XbM117,31.31,31.44, in the essay how many paragraphs that is,Structure
,,, and and how many key points how many,
,,, challenges how many causes you know how,
,,, many,
,,, issues how many solutions,
,,, etc etc and then they want to know that,
3ozZnT72XbM118,31.47,31.58, you are going to summarize all the,Structure
,,, points,
,,, at the end okay so uh,
,,, okay that's what uh i wanted to say,
,,, today that's my talk,
,,, uh that's what the lesson is all about,
3ozZnT72XbM120,32,32.2, it's about sign posting language,No
,,, focus on sign posting this week is very,
,,, important,
,,, for your essay writing and for your,
,,, presentation,
,,, preparation make sure you do your job,
,,, and if you have any questions you can,
,,, either ask me,
,,, or you can ask your teacher thank you,
,,, very much,
,,, and have a great day,
XyRjKCT_wrk1,0,0.14, when it comes to presenting online most,No
,,, of what we see is pretty in fact if,
,,, you're invited to watch an online,
,,, presentation or attend an online virtual,
,,, meeting your expectations are pretty low,
,,, well these are five top tips to make,
XyRjKCT_wrk2,0.17,0.3, sure you deliver awesome content that,No
,,, everybody will remember now it's worth,
,,, saying I'm assuming in this video that,
,,, you're going to be either filming on,
,,, your phone or on your laptop as most,
,,, people would be tip number one think,
XyRjKCT_wrk3,0.34,0.46, about the setting that you are in so,No
,,, when you're delivering an online,
,,, presentation really think about your,
,,, background what's behind you you don't,
,,, want anything that's too distracting so,
,,, not in the kitchen with all the kitchen,
XyRjKCT_wrk4,0.48,1, crap behind you you want something,No
,,, that's plain and that looks professional,
,,, just use a backdrop like I'm using now,
,,, this is just a standard black backdrop,
,,, and you can buy these on Amazon and,
,,, they're really not that expensive the,
XyRjKCT_wrk5,1.02,1.16, same you can get a stand to hold your,Structure
,,, backdrop on as well so I'd really,
,,, consider investing in one of those if,
,,, you're going to be doing more online,
,,, presentations think about how quiet the,
,,, area is that you're presenting in so you,
XyRjKCT_wrk6,1.18,1.33, don't want any background noise close,No
,,, the windows make it as quiet as possible,
,,, because when you're presenting online,
,,, the sound is really important and think,
,,, about the lighting as well so you want,
,,, the space that you're in to be really,
XyRjKCT_wrk7,1.35,1.46, well lit so turn the lights on if,No
,,, there's a window in the room that you're,
,,, in make sure that that is in front of,
,,, you and basically that no lighting,
,,, source is directly behind you because,
,,, what you'll find is it will look like,
XyRjKCT_wrk8,1.48,2.03, you're in darkness to the viewers so,No
,,, really think about the setting that,
,,, you're in number two stand up if you,
,,, stand up you will naturally deliver a,
,,, much better presentation you will look,
,,, like you are performing far too often,
XyRjKCT_wrk9,2.06,2.18, when we sit and we watch an online,No
,,, presentation we're watching somebody sat,
,,, at the table slunt down,
,,, it's hard to present from this point of,
,,, view it looks like they don't care it's,
,,, hard to retain somebody's attention when,
XyRjKCT_wrk10,2.21,2.34, you look like that so stand up and,No
,,, really give it a presentation style it,
,,, will shock the audience into listening,
,,, because most of what they see in online,
,,, presentations is crap and it will make,
,,, them listen,
XyRjKCT_wrk11,2.35,2.49, so deliver a performance by standing up,No
,,, now if you're going to stand up you need,
,,, to raise your laptop up higher so that,
,,, the lens of the camera is in your direct,
,,, eyeline you do not want to be looking,
,,, down at your camera lens because then,
XyRjKCT_wrk12,2.52,3.06, all your audience can see is the inside,No
,,, of your nose cavity so standing up will,
,,, just naturally make you deliver a better,
,,, presentation and that is key when,
,,, delivering a presentation online you are,
,,, still performing so stand up and perform,
XyRjKCT_wrk13,3.1,3.27, tip number three rehearse you need to,No
,,, treat your online presentation as you,
,,, would a presentation on a stage in front,
,,, of 200 people so practice get set up get,
,,, the camera set up and practice,
,,, performing to that camera lens tip,
XyRjKCT_wrk14,3.3,3.43, number four dress to impress how often,No
,,, do we watch people presenting online and,
,,, it looks like they've made no effort at,
,,, all you need to treat your online,
,,, presentation in the same way you would a,
,,, performance in front of 200 people so,
XyRjKCT_wrk15,3.46,3.58, dress to impress if it's casual,No
,,, something where you're maybe just,
,,, talking to colleagues something casual,
,,, like this would work but maybe if you're,
,,, presenting to customers you need to,
,,, dress smarter something like this the,
XyRjKCT_wrk16,4.01,4.12, important thing to remember with online,No
,,, presentations is you need to treat it as,
,,, you would a presentation in front of a,
,,, live audience so when it comes to what,
,,, to wear,
,,, my advice is mirror the audience if,
XyRjKCT_wrk17,4.14,4.26, you're presenting to colleagues then you,No
,,, can go with casual but if you're,
,,, presenting to customers I'd always go,
,,, with smart think about what you would be,
,,, wearing if you were on,
,,, and number five think about your,
XyRjKCT_wrk18,4.28,4.42, supporting material by supporting,No
,,, material,
,,, I mean PowerPoint Prezi whatever slide,
,,, format you intend to use but also video,
,,, as well don't ignore video you can still,
,,, start an online presentation with an,
XyRjKCT_wrk19,4.45,4.58, opening video if you want to and the,No
,,, slides that you use make sure you use,
,,, pictures so that people really remember,
,,, them and remember you and your content,
,,, and importantly with supporting content,
,,, you need to make sure that you have a,
XyRjKCT_wrk20,5,5.14, backup as well when things are online,No
,,, you always run the risk of the stream,
,,, going down and people not being able to,
,,, see you if this happens have your,
,,, supporting content your slides and your,
,,, opening video available so that you can,
XyRjKCT_wrk21,5.16,5.31, send it to people if they haven't been,No
,,, able to see it properly online so those,
,,, are my five top tips when it comes to,
,,, presenting online remember the,
,,, audience's expectation is low most of,
,,, these are [ __ ] so if you just put in,
XyRjKCT_wrk23,5.33,5.48, some extra effort and follow those five,No
,,, top tips you'll deliver some awesome,
,,, content that people will remember thanks,
,,, for watching that video I hope you found,
,,, it useful if you did here's the link to,

,,,  for life beyond school .,
WufMj1xHX306,1.17,1.33,  ( upbeat music ),No
,,,  So strategy number one .,
,,,  The simple thing that you can do is actually look,
,,,  at your stance when you come to deliver a presentation .,
,,,  Often what happens is when student stand,
,,,  to deliver a presentation the stance is really pole,
WufMj1xHX307,1.37,1.48,  and their foot are really close together .,No
,,,  And what this mean is that you end up wiggling and,
,,,  you know all of these like nervous gesture,
,,,  and these look horrible .,
,,,  That can be incredibly distracting .,
,,,  In fact you 've probably seen someone deliver a speech,
WufMj1xHX308,1.5,2.02,  and then just done this little this little dance,No
,,,  you know throughout the entire presentation,
,,,  and all you could look at wa their dance,
,,,  and their foot and not the actual presentation .,
,,,  So the suggestion here is really really simple .,
,,,  I want you to pretend that you 're Wonder Woman .,
WufMj1xHX309,2.04,2.13,  I know that sound weird .,No
,,,  Walk onto the stage,
,,,  and get your foot roughly should width apart .,
,,,  Really really important,
,,,  because it gon na actually root you into the ground,
,,,  so you 've got a strong stance .,
WufMj1xHX3010,2.14,2.25,  It 's much harder now to move around and wiggle .,No
,,,  It 's gon na really help you be able to present effectively .,
,,,  That 's the first thing .,
,,,  When you walk onto that stage,
,,,  to present your speech at school,
,,,  I want you to think about where are my foot,
WufMj1xHX3011,2.27,2.36,  and I am Wonder Woman right .,Structure
,,,  Get on there .,
,,,  Stand tall and strong,
,,,  and have your foot shoulder width apart,
,,,  and then start delivering your presentation .,
,,,  So the next strategy that you can use,
WufMj1xHX3012,2.38,2.5,  to be a more effective public speaker is pace .,No
,,,  So how quickly you 're speaking .,
,,,  So one of the thing I find is that because,
,,,  you 're nervous when you get onto that stage,
,,,  the first thing that you want to do,
,,,  is speak really really really really really quickly,
WufMj1xHX3013,2.52,3.03,  and everything 's got ta come at the same time and,No
,,,  you might feel you 're speaking slowly,
,,,  but the rest of the room is like whoa,
,,,  what on earth is happening .,
,,,  So you need to be able to slow your pace down,
,,,  and use pause effectively .,
WufMj1xHX3014,3.06,3.14,  And there 's a really simple way,No
,,,  that you can use pause effectively .,
,,,  I want you to get your speech out,
,,,  and identify what are some key area,
,,,  on the speech that you think,
,,,  pausing and slowing down is gon na be important,
WufMj1xHX3015,3.17,3.32,  a a reminder for you .,No
,,,  So note what I did there wa a pause of course .,
,,,  But one of the thing that you can do,
,,,  to work at how long you should pause for,
,,,  is to count for three second,
,,,  because often it 's gon na it 's gon na feel like,
WufMj1xHX3016,3.35,3.48,  you 're pausing for such a long period of time,No
,,,  but the reality is for the rest of the audience,
,,,  in the room gon na go like that .,
,,,  So to help you pause for long enough,
,,,  when you pause I want you to count in your head,
,,,  one two three .,
WufMj1xHX3017,3.51,3.59,  Three second and then continue going on .,Structure
,,,  So really simple .,
,,,  You 've got ta get your pacing right,
,,,  when you deliver,
,,,  and one of the thing that you can do,
,,,  is mark out in your speech when you 're gon na pause,
WufMj1xHX3018,4.02,4.11,  and then what you 're going to do,No
,,,  is you 're going to identify,
,,,  that you 're gon na pause for three second,
,,,  and count to three .,
,,,  So unless you 've got an incredible memory,
,,,  you 're not gon na be delivering your speech,
WufMj1xHX3019,4.13,4.24,  without some form of note .,No
,,,  Now using note is okay .,
,,,  You can deliver fantastic speech with note .,
,,,  But often what happens in a lot of speech at school,
,,,  is that,
,,,  you know the note become a crutch,
WufMj1xHX3020,4.27,4.39,  and so what end up happening is that,Structure
,,,  you know a student you walk out onto the stage,
,,,  and then what will end up happening is you read the note .,
,,,  So this is what need to happen,
,,,  and then what also need to happen is this,
,,,  and then I 'm going to read some more,
WufMj1xHX3021,4.4,4.49,  and then I 'm occasionally look up,No
,,,  but I 'm going to be mainly reading,
,,,  and then look up every now and then,
,,,  but really I 'm reading .,
,,,  In reality that 's not a great use of note .,
,,,  That 's not a great use of note,
WufMj1xHX3022,4.5,4.58,  because what you 're really doing,No
,,,  is reading,
,,,  and getting lost in what you 're reading,
,,,  and not maintaining eye contact,
,,,  with the audience around you .,
,,,  So a really simple thing that you can do,
WufMj1xHX3023,5,5.09,  and when you 're using note,No
,,,  is that you wan na use them a a way to,
,,,  to let you know what you need,
,,,  but then to be able to come back and,
,,,  make eye contact with the audience .,
,,,  So the suggestion I have is,
WufMj1xHX3024,5.11,5.2,  with your speech note,No
,,,  I want you to go through them .,
,,,  I want you to pick up a pen,
,,,  and at every point you think it 's gon na be really important,
,,,  to look at the audience to build eye contact,
,,,  I want you to make a little mark .,
WufMj1xHX3025,5.22,5.3,  A little mark so that if you are reading your note,No
,,,  and you see that little dot appear,
,,,  it 's a reminder to you to go,
,,,  I better look up and make some eye contact,
,,,  with the audience .,
,,,  So put these mark throughout your entire speech .,
WufMj1xHX3026,5.33,5.46,  It 'll make it really easy for you to look up,No
,,,  and then continue to go back to find where you were at .,
,,,  It will help you build more eye contact,
,,,  when you 're delivering your presentation using note .,
,,,  Instead of just having head stuck in,
,,,  and not actually building any repertoire or connection,
WufMj1xHX3027,5.49,5.59,  with your audience .,No
,,,  So the final point,
,,,  is that most of the time when people deliver speech,
,,,  they speak really quietly,
,,,  and no one can hear them .,
,,,  Right so vocal projection really really important .,
WufMj1xHX3028,6.02,6.13,  So you need to make sure that people at the back of the room,No
,,,  can still hear you .,
,,,  So the way that you do this,
,,,  is you 've actually got to over compensate,
,,,  because you 're gon na think,
,,,  you 're speaking really really loud,
WufMj1xHX3029,6.15,6.22,  and I promise you you 're not .,No
,,,  Now what 's gon na be happening,
,,,  is the nerve gon na get to you,
,,,  and you 're actually gon na,
,,,  be speaking quieter than you think .,
,,,  So one of the way that you can do this,
WufMj1xHX3030,6.23,6.33,  before going out to deliver a speech,Structure
,,,  is actually go to the toilet,
,,,  go to like the back oval somewhere at school,
,,,  and I want you to just shout .,
,,,  The whole point of this is to just,
,,,  go crazy and go extreme for a moment,
WufMj1xHX3031,6.35,6.47,  stretch the comfort zone,No
,,,  because then when you come back in to deliver your speech,
,,,  you 're gon na find that your volume,
,,,  actually naturally ha got a little bit louder,
,,,  because that 's what you were just doing before,
,,,  and you know you 're sort of borrowing some of that,
WufMj1xHX3032,6.49,6.59,  and bringing it into your space .,No
,,,  Its a really great way to really trick yourself,
,,,  into speaking more loudly,
,,,  in your presentation,
,,,  and having better vocal projection .,
,,,  So what I 've given you today guy,
WufMj1xHX3033,7.02,7.14,  is four strategy that you can use,No
,,,  to significantly improve your ability,
,,,  to deliver amazing oral presentation .,
,,,  We 've looked at stance and the Wonder Woman pose .,
,,,  We 've looked at pacing and the ability,
,,,  to slow down what you 're saying .,
WufMj1xHX3034,7.17,7.28,  We 've looked at vocal projection,No
,,,  and we 've looked at eye contact and use of note .,
,,,  You can nail these four strategy,
,,,  your ability to present confidently,
,,,  is going to improve dramatically .,
,,,  You 're going to get better result at school,
WufMj1xHX3035,7.29,7.39,  in your oral presentation .,No
,,,  But you 're also gon na be laying,
,,,  a really strong foundation for life beyond school .,
,,,  If you have more question about,
,,,  how to develop your public speaking skill,
,,,  leave 'em in the comment below I 'd love to help .,
WufMj1xHX3036,7.41,7.52,  Number two subscribe for more video .,No
,,,  We 're bringing video to you each week .,
,,,  So hit that subscribe button .,
,,,  Make sure you hit the bell to get notified .,
,,,  And finally if you think I want,
,,,  to learn even more about public speaking,
WufMj1xHX3037,7.54,8.07,  I encourage you to research,No
,,,  global not organization called Toastmasters .,
,,,  They 're incredible at helping people develop,
,,,  their public speaking skill,
,,,  and while they 're only available for people over 18,
,,,  you can invite them into your school,
WufMj1xHX3038,8.09,8.2,  to run program for you and your peer .,No
,,,  So might be something to look at .,
,,,  Check the link below in the description,
,,,  for more information .,
,,,  I 'll see you next week .,
,,,  ( light music ),
Rua5eBaX4gw1,0.04,0.13,  my name is reba and i am going to be,No
,,,  your course lecturer,
,,,  on this topic presentation skill so if,
,,,  you 're wondering why should i take up,
,,,  this course on effective presentation,
,,,  skill,
Rua5eBaX4gw2,0.14,0.25,  i 'm going to tell you exactly why our,Structure
,,,  key focus,
,,,  for this topic on presentation skill is,
,,,  going to be,
,,,  going beyond bullet and focusing on,
,,,  influence,
Rua5eBaX4gw3,0.26,0.35,  we strongly believe that today a normal,No
,,,  boring,
,,,  powerpoint presentation with ,
,,,  bullet point on it i 'm not it 's,
,,,  definitely not going to be enough for,
,,,  you to score client,
Rua5eBaX4gw4,0.37,0.47,  for you to close business deal for you,Structure
,,,  to get more sale,
,,,  it 's just not enough if you want to know,
,,,  if this course is really really,
,,,  something that you need,
,,,  i want you to ask yourself these,
Rua5eBaX4gw5,0.49,0.58,  question okay,Structure
,,,  are you conducting or taking business,
,,,  call over the phone right now,
,,,  just say yes or no okay are you pitching,
,,,  your product,
,,,  or service or your service offering on,
Rua5eBaX4gw6,1,1.11,  zoom or google meet or,No
,,,  any online portal right or window or,
,,,  microsoft team whatever it is are you,
,,,  pitching your product or service,
,,,  online do you think you sound dull or,
,,,  boring when you speak,
Rua5eBaX4gw7,1.12,1.21,  if that 's a yes consider doing this,No
,,,  course,
,,,  if any of these three question are yes,
,,,  consider doing the course right,
,,,  do you feel like people do n't quite,
,,,  understand you when you speak,
Rua5eBaX4gw8,1.23,1.33,  if it 's a yes consider doing the course,Structure
,,,  do you feel like your message always,
,,,  lack clarity,
,,,  again if it 's a yes you should consider,
,,,  doing this course,
,,,  most importantly are you doing well in,
Rua5eBaX4gw9,1.35,1.43,  interview,Structure
,,,  and here 's where the answer change if,
,,,  it 's a no,
,,,  you should consider doing this course,
,,,  let me tell you why,
,,,  there are a few thing that you need to,
Rua5eBaX4gw10,1.45,1.53,  know right now pitching is happening,No
,,,  online,
,,,  and it 's going to be this way in the,
,,,  foreseeable future,
,,,  attention span are much much shorter,
,,,  that mean visuals and crisp,
Rua5eBaX4gw11,1.55,2.06,  presentation are of the essence deal,No
,,,  are getting closed on phone call,
,,,  interview are happening on phone call,
,,,  sale are getting closed on phone call,
,,,  okay,
,,,  so that mean your voice is the only,
Rua5eBaX4gw12,2.08,2.16,  tool you have in your pocket,No
,,,  are you using it correctly most likely,
,,,  that,
,,,  the answer to this question is going to,
,,,  be no because people do n't understand,
,,,  the power of voice modulation,
Rua5eBaX4gw13,2.18,2.3,  something that we are going to be,No
,,,  covering in depth and in detail,
,,,  during this course audience engagement,
,,,  and speaker charisma,
,,,  is everything like literally everything,
,,,  if you ca n't keep your audience engaged,
Rua5eBaX4gw14,2.32,2.41,  if you ca n't keep them hooked and if you,No
,,,  ca n't keep them,
,,,  interested you might a well just not,
,,,  speak,
,,,  and that 's why these three thing,
,,,  right now is something you should be,
Rua5eBaX4gw15,2.44,2.53,  acing you should be async pitching,No
,,,  online or doing great virtual,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  you should be doing great call if it 's,
,,,  a tele call it 's a sale call it 's a,
,,,  business development call whatever it is,
Rua5eBaX4gw16,2.55,3.04,  you need to start acing them,Structure
,,,  and if you are someone who doe n't have,
,,,  charisma,
,,,  or who doe n't have the ability to keep,
,,,  your audience engaged,
,,,  consider doing this course okay,
Rua5eBaX4gw17,3.07,3.17,  this is what we plan to teach you our,No
,,,  entire module is focused on just three,
,,,  important word,
,,,  the first one is engage right and we,
,,,  just spoke about it,
,,,  so you will learn to engage with your,
Rua5eBaX4gw18,3.19,3.28,  audience because let 's face it,No
,,,  no one like one communication it 's,
,,,  dull,
,,,  it 's drab and it 's a complete waste of,
,,,  time you will also learn how to,
,,,  excite your audience you will learn,
Rua5eBaX4gw19,3.31,3.42,  technique and method to excite your,No
,,,  audience or your learner,
,,,  because this excitement is what 's going,
,,,  to ultimately lead to the third step,
,,,  and the third step the third pillar of,
,,,  this module,
Rua5eBaX4gw20,3.43,3.54,  is empower right what is empower,Structure
,,,  you will learn to empower and empowering,
,,,  mean leaving,
,,,  every presentation with a cta which is a,
,,,  call to action,
,,,  that mean you should want to make your,
Rua5eBaX4gw21,3.56,4.04,  learner want,No
,,,  to take action every time you 're done,
,,,  with a presentation if it 's a sale,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  they should want to buy a product if,
,,,  it 's a service presentation where you 're,
Rua5eBaX4gw22,4.06,4.15,  pitching a service,No
,,,  they should want to subscribe to your,
,,,  service if it 's a,
,,,  presentation at college people should,
,,,  want your professor should want to give,
,,,  you full mark right,
Rua5eBaX4gw23,4.17,4.25,  the goal should be that you should make,Structure
,,,  people want to do something,
,,,  it could be empowering them to take,
,,,  action,
,,,  and go and change their life it could,
,,,  be empowering them to,
Rua5eBaX4gw24,4.26,4.38,  subscribe to your service it could be,No
,,,  empowering them to buy a product,
,,,  you need to have a call to action so,
,,,  this is what we plan to teach you engage,
,,,  excite and empower so what are you,
,,,  waiting for,
Rua5eBaX4gw25,4.39,4.49,  sign up for the course start learning,Structure
,,,  start getting better at giving,
,,,  really good effective presentation what,
,,,  you absolutely need to know is that this,
,,,  is not just,
,,,  going to be video we want holistic,
Rua5eBaX4gw26,4.52,5.01,  development and so we 're going to have,Structure
,,,  assessment after each section,
,,,  we 're also going to be giving you a lot,
,,,  of learning material so that you can go,
,,,  back to this learning material,
,,,  and refer to it throughout we 're going,
Rua5eBaX4gw27,5.03,5.12,  to be giving you ton and ton of,No
,,,  example so it 's going to be,
,,,  very very experiential in in nature you,
,,,  will be able to relate to everything,
,,,  that we 're seeing,
,,,  and that 's going to help you remember,
Rua5eBaX4gw29,5.14,5.41,  every concept that you learn,Structure
,,,  you 've probably heard this line that the,
,,,  best investment,
,,,  that you make is the investment in,
,,,  yourself so stop thinking and start,
,,,  investing start the course get better,
,,,  be better perform better right if you,
,,,  want professional success,
,,,  start now,
,,,  you,
cj5aSWeJFj41,0.06,0.19,  here 's a little tip sometimes it help,No
,,,  if thing go wrong because then your,
,,,  audience warms up to you when they see,
,,,  how you manage it because we see you,
,,,  when you 're under pressure how you react,
,,,  that 's closer to the real deal,
cj5aSWeJFj42,0.24,0.42,  first thing to look more confident is,No
,,,  believe in yourself but that do n't,
,,,  student that day another technique to,
,,,  look more confident when you 're speaking,
,,,  is to breathe sound silly but you need,
,,,  to turn it and bring on the life not,
cj5aSWeJFj43,0.43,0.57,  tell me to breathe but here 's something,No
,,,  to keep in mind,
,,,  number one when we get nervous we tense,
,,,  up and we tend to hold our breath it 's a,
,,,  normal reaction we hear noise hear you,
,,,  breathe we do the same thing up there on,
cj5aSWeJFj44,1,1.14,  stage how many get nervous so remember,No
,,,  to remind celebrate and the second thing,
,,,  is to read member or house that we read,
,,,  correctly do we have any singer in the,
,,,  room,
,,,  okay so tell me the belly breath you get,
cj5aSWeJFj45,1.17,1.3,  really really teeny crack that the,No
,,,  correct way to breathe this from the,
,,,  bottom of your diaphragm which is behind,
,,,  your belly and if you 're breathing,
,,,  correctly there 's not a test result just,
,,,  try it right now put your hand on your,
cj5aSWeJFj46,1.32,1.46,  waist like this and then breathe it and,No
,,,  if you do it incorrectly you should be,
,,,  pushing out so they will not the tire,
,,,  wait a minute yourself now,
,,,  bring the air when you suck the air all,
,,,  the way down hold it for a few second,
cj5aSWeJFj47,1.49,2.07,  and then let it out slowly and when you,No
,,,  let it over,
,,,  that 's the correct way degree problem is,
,,,  we get busy and you watch a baby see,
,,,  we 're born with the ability to breathe,
,,,  correctly but we learn we learn math,
cj5aSWeJFj48,2.1,2.43,  you watch your baby if a baby 's the time,No
,,,  if you breathe correctly every one of,
,,,  you breathe correctly to calm yourself,
,,,  down you prevent the flutter in your,
,,,  head in your brain because sometimes,
,,,  that flutter is a lack of oxygen it 's,
cj5aSWeJFj49,2.46,2.57,  not enough oxygen,No
,,,  redirecting advantage enough number to,
,,,  breathe correctly you can project your,
,,,  voice how loud your eye got nothing to,
,,,  do how small or how big you are remember,
,,,  the baby it 's about how much area and,
cj5aSWeJFj411,3,3.24,  the third thing is if you breathe,No
,,,  correctly,
,,,  then you will be able to pause when you,
,,,  want to the next time you go to speak,
,,,  before you get up the speech you do n't,
,,,  check yourself remind yourself take a,
,,,  couple deep breath because it might be,
,,,  the last one you take for a while,

0EI3rSYARpQ12,2.32,2.48,  cybersecurity and an integration with,No
,,,  business continuity plan or actually,
,,,  actionable result and you yourselves,
,,,  have probably been in presentation and,
,,,  felt like what 's actually on this image,
,,,  and presenting itself standing up in,
0EI3rSYARpQ13,2.52,3.07,  front of an audience so if we look at,No
,,,  the top 10 it 's it 's right there at,
,,,  number 2 so understandable,
,,,  now take that fear of public speaking,
,,,  and put it in front of your bos or your,
,,,  bos 's bos and it get a little,
0EI3rSYARpQ14,3.09,3.22,  stressful,No
,,,  so I want to make a point during this,
,,,  presentation I 'm actually going to play,
,,,  two different role my first role a I 'm,
,,,  doing now is a the presenter I will,
,,,  step aside in a dual personality world,
0EI3rSYARpQ15,3.24,3.37,  and talk about the presentation itself,Structure
,,,  so I 'm going to be playing that,
,,,  balancing act a we go so will you,
,,,  normally see it a good presentation is,
,,,  usually there 's a start and I love this,
,,,  one especially why if you in an audience,
0EI3rSYARpQ16,3.42,3.56,  and your are doing a present or watching,No
,,,  a presentation look around how fast the,
,,,  people pick up the phone with open the,
,,,  laptop you 've got 30 second that impact,
,,,  of what you 're going to do have to have,
,,,  a captured audience attention otherwise,
0EI3rSYARpQ17,3.59,4.15,  it becomes a lot more difficult so in,Structure
,,,  doing it and building that it relates to,
,,,  the human brain or one side of the brain,
,,,  is our feeling right it 's that,
,,,  creativity to the thinking side but on,
,,,  the other side it 's the analytical side,
0EI3rSYARpQ18,4.17,4.32,  and if we 're going to do an effective,Structure
,,,  presentation it 's got to cover both,
,,,  side of that and that presentation the,
,,,  best way to get it across is to tell u,
,,,  and that 's exactly what we 're going to,
,,,  do so let 's take a look we 're doing,
0EI3rSYARpQ19,4.36,4.51,  we 're gon na find out understand who our,No
,,,  audience is why they 're there go through,
,,,  that process what 's the message what 's,
,,,  the takeaway we 're going to give them,
,,,  and how do we build that story for them,
,,,  talk about some of the delivery tip and,
0EI3rSYARpQ20,4.54,5.08,  making sure that we 're successful and,Structure
,,,  that your presentation is heard and they,
,,,  leave with it,
,,,  I even that reference I 'll cover them,
,,,  a well so let 's start with our audience,
,,,  I call it the four value who are they,
0EI3rSYARpQ21,5.13,5.26,  who 's sitting there who 's who 's sitting,No
,,,  in the hi audience now will they know,
,,,  about the subject that I 'm going to be,
,,,  speaking on whether that be in an indie,
,,,  industry conference or my board I really,
,,,  want to get in good sense because I 've,
0EI3rSYARpQ22,5.28,5.45,  got to build that story and content to,Structure
,,,  them think why are they there again it,
,,,  sit there because you 've been required,
,,,  to show up or you have finding what 's,
,,,  that core and more importantly what do,
,,,  we want them to lead with it you go to a,
0EI3rSYARpQ23,5.48,6.04,  presentation what it is about learning,Structure
,,,  one is it an aha moment is n't it ask,
,,,  usually board and senior leadership I,
,,,  find it 's an ask I need money to fund,
,,,  this or mitigate these risk so let 's,
,,,  take the valve into the two key,
0EI3rSYARpQ24,6.06,6.24,  audience that we 're going to be looking,No
,,,  at first one is the board amount I 'm,
,,,  gon na step back what you 'll notice is my,
,,,  background I use a lot of imagery I make,
,,,  it strong it support exactly what I 'm,
,,,  going to be talking about but it doe n't,
0EI3rSYARpQ25,6.27,6.42,  over shadow it 's about the content so,No
,,,  I 'm using complimentary ms/ms imagery a,
,,,  I go through this sometimes to make a,
,,,  point or otherwise support it back to,
,,,  our regular schedule,
,,,  so who are they your board come from,
0EI3rSYARpQ26,6.46,7.02,  all over and the larger your,Structure
,,,  organization,
,,,  the bigger the people they 're going to,
,,,  be teeth information security CEOs of,
,,,  both current and retired for position,
,,,  let 's make some assumption one thing,
0EI3rSYARpQ27,7.04,7.16,  though they 're going to have a very,No
,,,  little knowledge of business continuity,
,,,  I 've got to make that assumption and,
,,,  we 'll talk through that a well if,
,,,  that 's not their key even from a CIO it,
,,,  is a former CI oh you do n't have that,
0EI3rSYARpQ28,7.19,7.35,  desk and honestly this you 're a stranger,No
,,,  you 're coming in usually through senior,
,,,  leadership they probably do n't know you,
,,,  especially if it 's your first,
,,,  presentation and this is a real,
,,,  important so I 'm going to talk about,
0EI3rSYARpQ29,7.36,7.5,  this they have a sanitized view a a,Structure
,,,  former senior leader what our board knew,
,,,  about our organization is what we,
,,,  present it to them,
,,,  so when you 're doing in developing a,
,,,  presentation it 's probably going to go,
0EI3rSYARpQ30,7.52,8.1,  through about four to five hundred,No
,,,  iteration because everybody want to,
,,,  make sure that that message is clean and,
,,,  correct again now it 's the senior,
,,,  leadership notice the image image show,
,,,  that support what I presented so right,
0EI3rSYARpQ31,8.17,8.31,  obviously Captain Obvious is the,No
,,,  currency 's fo io Sol alphabet soup but,
,,,  again there are those are the people,
,,,  that are going to be sitting in that,
,,,  boardroom that we 're going to be talking,
,,,  to I 'm going to make some assumption,
0EI3rSYARpQ32,8.33,8.44,  that they have some passing note,Structure
,,,  whether you 've got it predecessor or,
,,,  previous organization or a they 've,
,,,  grown through a organization the chance,
,,,  are they know that there 's thing such,
,,,  a plan and disaster recovery so,
0EI3rSYARpQ33,8.47,8.56,  they 're on the passing knowledge and the,No
,,,  nice thing is hey they may even know you,
,,,  spending it at your bos your bos 's,
,,,  bos at your bos 's bos 's bos they,
,,,  mean,
,,,  having a relationship or a knowledge of,
0EI3rSYARpQ34,9,9.15,  that person will help and honestly they,Structure
,,,  have a very or more realistic view than,
,,,  the board because again a thing go up,
,,,  they do get filtered and that really is,
,,,  important to the perspective that we 're,
,,,  going to have is that so when we look at,
0EI3rSYARpQ35,9.17,9.32,  perspective let 's look at it from a,Structure
,,,  board view hmm business continuity what,
,,,  they know is probably from an internal,
,,,  or an external audit of a company that,
,,,  they 've dealt with the report of,
,,,  finding that come up that 's going to be,
0EI3rSYARpQ36,9.35,9.52,  their knowledge or if somebody like you,No
,,,  were or I have student front of them in,
,,,  their own organization and dowsing this,
,,,  is big this is it current news in the,
,,,  new this is how are we reacting so,
,,,  they 're going to take that to senior,
0EI3rSYARpQ37,9.54,10.06,  leader and so so how are you and I 'm,Structure
,,,  going to be  fall out or how are we,
,,,  handling what the data breach that is,
,,,  that if that 's that occur what is our,
,,,  stance and what are you doing to fix it,
,,,  so that drive a lot of the board down,
0EI3rSYARpQ38,10.09,10.25,  to senior leadership and then down to u,No
,,,  hey their own staff may have have been,
,,,  involved in a presentation internally a,
,,,  them at senior leader so we really want,
,,,  to know okay I 've got this much,
,,,  knowledge again passing our senior,
0EI3rSYARpQ39,10.29,10.41,  leader Oh a little different again,No
,,,  notice very similar the board procedure,
,,,  see new leader may be board member,
,,,  elsewhere,
,,,  it 's their internal finding there are,
,,,  chief risk officer coming and saying,
0EI3rSYARpQ40,10.43,11,  hey we 've got to mitigate these issue,No
,,,  usually come from top board as,
,,,  and senior leader senior leader ask,
,,,  those director a president and if all,
,,,  of them and that 's where becoming I love,
,,,  this one I have to tell you that in a,
0EI3rSYARpQ41,11.02,11.13,  guy little story here view,Structure
,,,  self this is probably where,
,,,  you 'll see the most success,
,,,  [ Music ],
,,,  in an organization your organization is,
,,,  we know there 's an issue we want to fix,
0EI3rSYARpQ42,11.16,11.32,  this what do we need to do it really,Structure
,,,  resounds it start the top,
,,,  that 's like goverce that so effective,
,,,  in business continuity success is that,
,,,  that board ha that aura senior leader,
,,,  ha that self,
0EI3rSYARpQ43,11.34,11.51,  Matt let 's take the positive and just,Structure
,,,  put some caveat out there any question,
,,,  are usually going to be politically,
,,,  motivated and when they explain why or,
,,,  how having been through receiving it,
,,,  into those question,
0EI3rSYARpQ44,11.52,12.1,  so first I 'm a smartest guy in the room,No
,,,  I need to ask this question a I already,
,,,  know the answer but remember we 're the,
,,,  subject matter expert when that happens,
,,,  we have a board level I will look to the,
,,,  senior leader we probably revert,
0EI3rSYARpQ45,12.12,12.25,  rehearse this so I 've already covered,No
,,,  this a an outside consultant it 's a lot,
,,,  easier you can nobody tell me to lead so,
,,,  here 's the big one not only am i smarter,
,,,  than you meeting them in the audience,
,,,  back and forth is there usually is,
0EI3rSYARpQ46,12.28,12.41,  posturing that somebody that person,No
,,,  want to be the next CEO and so when the,
,,,  board doe their nomination that come,
,,,  around a hey this guy is really really,
,,,  smart or the scout really really smart,
,,,  we should make them antsy so how do I,
0EI3rSYARpQ47,12.46,13.01,  fix it normally at this point I would,No
,,,  have played the video but video audio,
,,,  sound doe not play well so I 've,
,,,  actually you can have this deck my,
,,,  email at the end of this book the link,
,,,  in there is also at the bottom this is a,
0EI3rSYARpQ48,13.03,13.18,  two minute and 40 second ideo remember,No
,,,  I said start in tactful have that,
,,,  imagery I 'm using video this video is,
,,,  about an identical twin that an elevator,
,,,  once prepared and one not and it cover,
,,,  all aspect of why you need a plan how,
0EI3rSYARpQ49,13.21,13.32,  to prepare for disaster,No
,,,  what you should be doing in disaster,
,,,  and the imagery and the background,
,,,  change but what it doe is this is,
,,,  replicates the board because those,
,,,  people or senior leader may be afraid,
0EI3rSYARpQ50,13.35,13.47,  to ask question because they do n't want,Structure
,,,  to look stupid to their peer it also,
,,,  set a baseline remember we do n't know,
,,,  what they do n't know this kind of raise,
,,,  it up,
,,,  I also recommend it 's a great use if,
0EI3rSYARpQ51,13.49,14.01,  you 're doing business continuity,No
,,,  training a part of your life cycle it 's,
,,,  a great video I suggest you download it,
,,,  because we are a business continuity and,
,,,  playing it off the web can be risky,
,,,  so I usually embed this in the,
0EI3rSYARpQ52,14.03,14.13,  PowerPoint when I do my PowerPoint,No
,,,  presentation but again very highly,
,,,  effective and even ha a Department of,
,,,  Homeland Security and it talk,
,,,  essentially about active shooter at the,
,,,  end and it open the question which is,
0EI3rSYARpQ53,14.15,14.34,  a beautiful beautiful introduction to,No
,,,  your presentation,
,,,  so speaking of presentation this is a,
,,,  national photo off my phone what 's the,
,,,  message what what is my takeaway from,
,,,  this line otherwise my eye are bleeding,
0EI3rSYARpQ54,14.37,14.51,  what I find is even more ironic if you,Structure
,,,  look in the upper right hand corner,
,,,  it 's from the marketing communication,
,,,  cooking journalism it 's overwhelming if,
,,,  you 're going to start or tell that story,
,,,  have an impact,
0EI3rSYARpQ55,14.53,15.04,  I 'll give you a great example let 's stay,Structure
,,,  with cybersecurity,
,,,  ransomware it 's a great one ok I 'm going,
,,,  to start talking about so when we look,
,,,  at threat to our organization and I,
,,,  start going through this slide where 's,
0EI3rSYARpQ56,15.06,15.23,  your eye are you listening to me,No
,,,  no you 're trying to figure this slide,
,,,  out and it 's not personal it doe n't,
,,,  impact you most of the presentation,
,,,  that I do I will use very visual and,
,,,  strong imagery because it becomes the,
0EI3rSYARpQ57,15.26,15.4,  point to tell the story so instead of,No
,,,  this to talk about it I say ok this ha,
,,,  just hit our,
,,,  company this is on everybody 's desk top,
,,,  right back,
,,,  what are we going to do,
0EI3rSYARpQ58,15.46,16.02,  pause are great by the way give u a,No
,,,  chance to capture our thought use the,
,,,  emphasis and lead on into the next slide,
,,,  so now I can tell my story of what we 're,
,,,  going to do and how we 're going to do,
,,,  that but this is relatable this is new,
0EI3rSYARpQ59,16.04,16.18,  this is current I actually use this for,No
,,,  our tabletop exercise that we actually,
,,,  have an animated oh they see it going,
,,,  let 's look at that story let 's talk,
,,,  about building the story itself so the,
,,,  story where do we start,
0EI3rSYARpQ60,16.21,16.34,  it 's hard it 's overwhelming so start,Structure
,,,  with an outline whether it be word or,
,,,  the PowerPoint outline like way just,
,,,  create the outline and then I wa called,
,,,  rankbrain and I keep looking at I talk,
,,,  and I socialize that outline got it,
0EI3rSYARpQ61,16.37,16.51,  okay from there this work really well,Structure
,,,  create the title from the slide now that,
,,,  I 've got the outline because I 'm a oh I,
,,,  miss this one let me go back and put one,
,,,  in there creating the title create that,
,,,  flow that organic way again I 'm speaking,
0EI3rSYARpQ62,16.54,17.06,  and it 's flowing we want the same thing,Structure
,,,  I 'm doing that by having the title and,
,,,  if you 've noticed I do n't have a lot of,
,,,  title sometimes I just have the content,
,,,  or the image but again this is exactly,
,,,  how you start now they 've got it create,
0EI3rSYARpQ63,17.1,17.22,  the or find the image to support it,No
,,,  look at this title say building a story,
,,,  and I 've got a story book open and we 're,
,,,  building that story what that 's,
,,,  supporting image is exactly what 's,
,,,  needed for this slide Matt lean content,
0EI3rSYARpQ64,17.28,17.42,  we 'll talk a little bit later on about,Structure
,,,  how we knit should be remember press,
,,,  it 's more we want to put it in it got,
,,,  to support the image and the outline and,
,,,  that title so now we 're building up from,
,,,  that here we go I need to test it go,
0EI3rSYARpQ65,17.48,18,  through that walkthrough,Structure
,,,  socialize it internally with your team,
,,,  with your bos this point is what you 're,
,,,  going to do is always go back and refine,
,,,  in all honesty when I do a presentation,
,,,  at a conference or for a client,
0EI3rSYARpQ66,18.03,18.19,  I 'm usually refining it the day of or,No
,,,  that morning in fact this presentation,
,,,  here pinky an hour of no we were,
,,,  changing image because I did n't feel,
,,,  that it worked and I wa doing just that,
,,,  I wa refining it defining it and then,
0EI3rSYARpQ67,18.22,18.39,  delivery let 's take a look at some of,No
,,,  those delivery of tip that we can,
,,,  help make you have that confidence in,
,,,  that success in front of data lady,
,,,  and see that you immediately laxity you,
,,,  look at the image of one right to the,
0EI3rSYARpQ68,18.41,18.57,  top because again I want to support that,No
,,,  so first of all you can probably if you,
,,,  were this is live I used to be a chuckle,
,,,  you do n't read your supply which I just,
,,,  did because people read faster then you,
,,,  talk no matter how fast you talk so I,
0EI3rSYARpQ69,19.01,19.17,  ca n't focus on two different thing,No
,,,  if they call it power point too often,
,,,  you go to a presentation and it 's not,
,,,  even a power read so we do n't want that,
,,,  use it a a talking point and that 's,
,,,  that refine on the previous slide we,
0EI3rSYARpQ70,19.18,19.35,  want to refine it let me get it down so,Structure
,,,  the message there with that take away,
,,,  this is really really hard to do a,
,,,  conference my presentation will say,
,,,  here 's the ally I do n't in my,
,,,  presentation at an event I 'm six let 's,
0EI3rSYARpQ71,19.37,19.55,  fix them up to that point but why why go,No
,,,  what right if you 're coming to hear this,
,,,  content come hear the content,
,,,  do n't ever ever use somebody else 's deck,
,,,  it 's not your own you need to know those,
,,,  material and you need to know them well,
0EI3rSYARpQ72,19.57,20.07,  I do n't say memorize them I think that 's,No
,,,  really hard because it lock you into,
,,,  into it and you,
,,,  they 're not able to read the audience,
,,,  and you might make change my last,
,,,  presentation at a secure conference on,
0EI3rSYARpQ73,20.11,20.24,  my flight over I wa reading and that,No
,,,  Facebook 3.1 million people of that I,
,,,  did that right into my slide and I,
,,,  changed it right under there so what I,
,,,  use a mirror right it sound kind of,
,,,  funny but until you 're comfortable take,
0EI3rSYARpQ74,20.27,20.38,  a look at it,Structure
,,,  have somebody friend family record it,
,,,  use your phone,
,,,  we 're our own worst critic so let 's use,
,,,  that where can I refine it watch the,
,,,  presentation listen to let me see how I,
0EI3rSYARpQ75,20.42,21.1,  am presenting big one here remember,No
,,,  people read faster than we talk I want,
,,,  to talk to the point but not read it so,
,,,  now I 'm controlling the audience and how,
,,,  we 're going through so this building of,
,,,  those slide really meant let me do just,
0EI3rSYARpQ76,21.13,21.3,  that so another delivery tip you 've done,No
,,,  the refinement you 've done the testing,
,,,  you know how long it take big point,
,,,  here just because you have an hour which,
,,,  maybe you do n't but just because you,
,,,  have that timeframe do n't do it if,
0EI3rSYARpQ77,21.33,21.45,  you 've got a lot of slide you might,No
,,,  want to speak a little better at a,
,,,  faster pace or talk at a normal pace,
,,,  because I have enough slide and I know,
,,,  the time that it 's going to take to do,
,,,  it and I 'm not saying being an,
0EI3rSYARpQ78,21.47,22,  auctioneer you 've got too many slide if,No
,,,  you 're trying to cram them in I did a,
,,,  previous presentation on lizard brain,
,,,  and that wa almost 60 slide I 'm just,
,,,  done in 40 minute at talking at a pace,
,,,  like this why because weather or more,
0EI3rSYARpQ79,22.03,22.22,  slide were very graphic and they were,No
,,,  just for a second to explain the topic,
,,,  you 've heard me a I 've been presenting,
,,,  I speed it up I 've lowered my voice I,
,,,  can use pause for emphasis and do that,
,,,  you 've seen Ferris Bueller 's Day Off,
0EI3rSYARpQ80,22.26,22.46,  that 's the example of what not to do,No
,,,  their Earth revolves around the Sun,
,,,  someone who doe n't moderate their pitch,
,,,  and speed I do this it 's a very,
,,,  effective technique I follow this craft,
,,,  and that presentation very closely in,
0EI3rSYARpQ81,22.48,23,  the award he did a presentation,No
,,,  on why he is the world 's greatest,
,,,  speaker and it 's the one with the,
,,,  psychological thing opening up the hand,
,,,  to your audience show vulnerability and,
,,,  build trust so by doing this it really,
0EI3rSYARpQ82,23.06,23.25,  engages that what is even further and,No
,,,  again overdress you are the subject,
,,,  matter expert you should come across,
,,,  that way now I know this may be a little,
,,,  difficult so I 'm going to point it out,
,,,  to you it 's a trick I 've used for year,
0EI3rSYARpQ83,23.29,23.42,  in doing my slide is how do I,No
,,,  transition verbal how do I blend,
,,,  seamlessly from one slide to the other,
,,,  so I do n't know if you can see this or,
,,,  not but down in the lower left corner I,
,,,  made it even darker than I would,
0EI3rSYARpQ84,23.44,24.01,  normally it ha my transition word so,No
,,,  now I 'll use it coming back laying the,
,,,  door up so now that we 've got some good,
,,,  delivery tip let 's talk a little bit,
,,,  more about making them effective and one,
,,,  of the way I like to make thing,
0EI3rSYARpQ85,24.02,24.17,  effective again how do you know your,No
,,,  audience you may not have direct contact,
,,,  with is linked it is oh look at them,
,,,  because one of the thing that I pointed,
,,,  out again it is having that relationship,
,,,  of having something to talk about before,
0EI3rSYARpQ86,24.21,24.38,  after the presentation really help,No
,,,  so learning the port hey I just see you,
,,,  guy bought heartland security wa,
,,,  really neat how 's that going front,
,,,  before or afterwards is what it again,
,,,  what do we want them to leave with it 's,
0EI3rSYARpQ87,24.39,24.55,  the content it 's the message is that ask,Structure
,,,  them the story key point here and,
,,,  actually a red flag you 're going to,
,,,  start late especially a senior leader or,
,,,  board and you 're finishing on quote time,
,,,  that you were supposed to or maybe early,
0EI3rSYARpQ88,24.57,25.08,  because they 're now running behind I wa,No
,,,  out in Carlsbad California at a board in,
,,,  the boardroom to do a presentation that,
,,,  started at eight o'clock and I went on a,
,,,  date o'clock I wa there at 7:00 that,
,,,  you truly a being all that wa working,
0EI3rSYARpQ89,25.1,25.22,  great view of the Pacific Ocean,No
,,,  ox like this is awesome I think it,
,,,  started until eight twenty three I wa,
,,,  in the room they 're right they 're,
,,,  getting their coffee and they 're,
,,,  chatting around and they 're waiting for,
0EI3rSYARpQ90,25.24,25.47,  everybody else and there are CEOs wait I,No
,,,  knew and again I had built my,
,,,  presentation so that I could talk slower,
,,,  or faster to get that material across,
,,,  now I did say a red flag look I got mad,
,,,  PowerPoint skill I can do cool thing,
0EI3rSYARpQ91,25.49,26.08,  of it this is not the time I do n't know,No
,,,  where it is to do that keep it clean and,
,,,  concise use a single font and do a,
,,,  simple build you can see I 'm using,
,,,  appear once in a while with my arrow,
,,,  I 'll use them for emphasis but I 'm using,
0EI3rSYARpQ92,26.11,26.24,  that simple bill remember direct and,Structure
,,,  guide the audience through your,
,,,  presentation a little read ahead,
,,,  otherwise ah,
,,,  again Matt power point crease skill,
,,,  we see that the rainbow or the dissolve,
0EI3rSYARpQ93,26.28,26.41,  that their sin it 's a problem people,No
,,,  will start to count them and lose the,
,,,  presentation it 's no different and when,
,,,  I used to start,
,,,  and again this is a very common,
,,,  presentation skill how do you fill the,
0EI3rSYARpQ94,26.44,27.01,  silence you know well people are,No
,,,  uncomfortable to present with that you,
,,,  need to have that comfort people will,
,,,  start to count the omen and the you,
,,,  note and that overpowers that is that,
,,,  presentation that 's that 's a skill that,
0EI3rSYARpQ95,27.03,27.2,  you need to learn it and that come out,No
,,,  when you do your rehearsal here 's a,
,,,  great one I 'm talking about animation,
,,,  bullet everybody us dumb and when I,
,,,  suppose I actually presented this a a,
,,,  national ACP and Charlie did a,
0EI3rSYARpQ96,27.24,27.39,  presentation after me and actually made,No
,,,  reference to the fact that it she 's not,
,,,  taking the math you do n't have to but,
,,,  it 's clean it clean that up it give,
,,,  you more room for larger haunt,
,,,  now guy Kawasaki is a great presenter,
0EI3rSYARpQ97,27.43,28.04,  the futurist technologist I follow him,No
,,,  he ha a 10 rule and again it 's a,
,,,  role I use it a a guide ten slide,
,,,  twenty point five thirty minute it 's a,
,,,  guy remember we want to build lean,
,,,  content so in building that lean content,
0EI3rSYARpQ98,28.07,28.2,  this is a good way to do it so what,No
,,,  we 've done we 've looked at building the,
,,,  story we look that we know who the,
,,,  audience is so you guy are ready I 'm,
,,,  going to turn the camera around,
,,,  well it 's nervous hey they go on in,
0EI3rSYARpQ99,28.28,28.46,  sometimes there 's camera there 's that,No
,,,  podium in front of me so now let 's get,
,,,  out front let 's get in front of that,
,,,  first of all do n't use the pose,
,,,  psychologically it is a support,
,,,  mechanism,
0EI3rSYARpQ100,28.47,29,  it put me,No
,,,  from my audience want to come around,
,,,  from the polio Hotel you do n't touch the,
,,,  podium even for emphasis for,
,,,  president,
,,,  how doe graduation absolutely State of,
0EI3rSYARpQ101,29.03,29.19,  the Union speech absolutely for u,No
,,,  we 're here present a material I need you,
,,,  to get it get there early why you need,
,,,  to have anchor now who 's an anchor if,
,,,  somebody in the audience or people in,
,,,  the audience right it established a,
0EI3rSYARpQ102,29.21,29.36,  rapport we 've talked about it hey how 's,No
,,,  that coffee earth hey you came in from,
,,,  the beautiful hi oh wow why because a,
,,,  I 'm presenting I now have that I can,
,,,  establish eye contact with those do n't,
,,,  lock in just one person you 're going to,
0EI3rSYARpQ103,29.39,29.51,  look over the audience establish that,No
,,,  eye contact it show confidence and,
,,,  having those anchor are really good,
,,,  because what do they think they 're going,
,,,  to do when you look at them they 're,
,,,  going to smile and I need that that 's,
0EI3rSYARpQ104,29.54,30.03,  going to make me feel good I 'm on target,No
,,,  this reading the audience is going to be,
,,,  very effective,
,,,  remember that slide you 've got 30,
,,,  second you can tell how well you 're,
,,,  doing let 's set the Asia Pacific Rim,
0EI3rSYARpQ105,30.06,30.16,  because they never ever look at this the,No
,,,  presenter they close their eye or,
,,,  they 're on their laptop but I get to see,
,,,  that I context like engage how well am i,
,,,  doing,
,,,  do I need to raise my voice up a little,
0EI3rSYARpQ106,30.18,30.32,  bit to get that attention or can I keep,No
,,,  it we 're on that really really important,
,,,  reading the audience getting those,
,,,  anchor and that eye contact,
,,,  so the next one engaging the audience no,
,,,  upfront are you going to take question,
0EI3rSYARpQ107,30.35,30.52,  during it now during a board meeting you,No
,,,  usually do n't have a choice why we use,
,,,  the video up front but you need to make,
,,,  that determination it is a skill how to,
,,,  facilitate question where people that,
,,,  are just like your board that want to,
0EI3rSYARpQ108,30.54,31.03,  show that the audience that they know,No
,,,  more how do you effectively defer that,
,,,  hey that 's a great question we talked,
,,,  about that later because right now is,
,,,  kind of doe n't relate to what I need to,
,,,  do so thank you just,
0EI3rSYARpQ109,31.05,31.17,  asked him a question and gave him the,No
,,,  answer and I wa able to move on that 's,
,,,  hard it is a very difficult one to do,
,,,  especially in the leadership of board,
,,,  meeting so you want to ask those,
,,,  question will they be asking question,
0EI3rSYARpQ110,31.19,31.31,  or am I just doing the presentation and,No
,,,  waiting to after work Jim did a great,
,,,  job and unfortunately on the WebEx you,
,,,  ca n't have that interactive so we 're,
,,,  going to do it at the end but again,
,,,  having that set up front make a big,
0EI3rSYARpQ111,31.35,31.55,  difference cause for effect the jumpa my,No
,,,  role so again lower corner of the screen,
,,,  tell me what my next slide transition,
,,,  is and it 's difficult a usual your back,
,,,  is to your screen so you want to put it,
,,,  there so in this case I 'd be standing on,
0EI3rSYARpQ112,31.57,32.1,  this side and then be able to look to,No
,,,  the right and pick it up nobody ha ever,
,,,  noticed it cuz again we 're keeping the,
,,,  focus on that date twenty four to thirty,
,,,  point one and the image and the content,
,,,  but it 's just subtle so let 's talk about,
0EI3rSYARpQ113,32.15,32.32,  now we 're upfront no fear or hope now,No
,,,  I 'm gon na tell you why you 're gon na be,
,,,  successful if you 've seen American Idol,
,,,  you 've been in a presentation the,
,,,  audience want you to succeed they 're,
,,,  cheering for you,
0EI3rSYARpQ114,32.34,32.5,  early on sometimes it get to a point,Structure
,,,  where it 's a law of diminishing return,
,,,  but they do they want you to succeed,
,,,  here 's another another caveat healthy,
,,,  life here if you 're nervous and then,
,,,  you 're comfortable with that or eight,
0EI3rSYARpQ115,32.51,33.03,  is n't my first time boy they 're going to,No
,,,  be behind you and be a lot more,
,,,  forgiving honesty help remember that,
,,,  open hand that 's it hey I 'm a little,
,,,  nervous here this is my first time or a,
,,,  while I 've never presented this such a,
0EI3rSYARpQ116,33.05,33.23,  they bought it this is cool,No
,,,  no you 're prepared you know your,
,,,  material it 's yours,
,,,  you built it you wrote it,
,,,  you are ready you 're gon na focus on the,
,,,  presentation I 'm so nervous,
0EI3rSYARpQ117,33.25,33.36,  yeah that 's natural there 's always in,No
,,,  trepidation mobile nerve and get it,
,,,  better that 's what make it good but,
,,,  you 're gon na focus on your material that,
,,,  get you there they say redirecting,
,,,  nervous energy that 's where you 're gon na,
0EI3rSYARpQ118,33.38,33.54,  do it you 're gon na focus on that,No
,,,  hey good opener right my favorite opener,
,,,  thank you for coming,
,,,  I 'm excited to be here some case I 'll,
,,,  bring it in so it you know hey thanks,
,,,  for the interruption I wa on my way,
0EI3rSYARpQ119,33.56,34.12,  here and I 'm telling a relevant story a,Structure
,,,  I did with that I saw me do this boom,
,,,  boom boom and then they blended that,
,,,  into my presentation whether you 're an,
,,,  introvert or an extrovert you 're good at,
,,,  your job you 're there for a reason let,
0EI3rSYARpQ120,34.17,34.33,  that passion knowledge and energy come,No
,,,  through when redirected you will be,
,,,  successful in it I remember that,
,,,  audience right they 're there for a,
,,,  couple of different reason or a single,
,,,  focus I need to hear where what we 're,
0EI3rSYARpQ121,34.36,34.49,  doing or what you 're going we 're doing,No
,,,  a a company for this or one of those,
,,,  stats show me some dashboard on what 's,
,,,  our progress or where the money need to,
,,,  come they 're there for a reason and,
,,,  probably the most important you see it,
0EI3rSYARpQ122,34.52,35.08,  with humor is that you 've made it,No
,,,  through this entire presentation so I,
,,,  want to talk about reference yeah so,
,,,  Guy Kawasaki he 's got that 10 rule,
,,,  and then what those 10 slide out of it,
,,,  so it 's really good Seth Godin creates a,
0EI3rSYARpQ123,35.1,35.23,  great book he 's got an article it 's like,No
,,,  a page on a bad PowerPoint if you,
,,,  have n't already seen TED talk there are,
,,,  10 tip for the Fazio watch are my,
,,,  favorite is the deaf my powerpoint and,
,,,  these are some of the stuff I brought in,
0EI3rSYARpQ124,35.25,35.39,  here the brain rule about moving that,Structure
,,,  effective presentation even the,
,,,  Department of Homeland Security,
,,,  is a great resource to use in doing that,
,,,  education and there are a lot of law,
,,,  and other thing out there on improving,
0EI3rSYARpQ125,35.42,35.55,  presentation skill,No
,,,  I like Larry 's it 's pretty pretty,
,,,  concise a well so at this point I want,
,,,  to thank you very much,
,,,  I like to tie in what I start with with,
,,,  what I end so in my closing remark you,
0EI3rSYARpQ126,36.03,36.16,  do n't need that by PowerPoint you have,No
,,,  the tool you have the knowledge it 's a,
,,,  matter of refining them building them,
,,,  and effectively using so thank you Jim,
,,,  would like to open it up for question,
,,,  if there are n't yes certainly and thank,
0EI3rSYARpQ127,36.19,36.33,  you so much Chris very informative and,No
,,,  certainly very useful and we encourage,
,,,  obviously people to make the best use of,
,,,  what you had to offer here today a,
,,,  number of people have asked if the,
,,,  slide would be available and they will,
0EI3rSYARpQ128,36.36,36.53,  be you see Chris 's email right there and,No
,,,  if you dropped him a line he will email,
,,,  you the PDF Yeah right all you 're gon na,
,,,  get in the debt nothing else I 'm not,
,,,  obsessed all right so a couple of the,
,,,  other question oh how do you cover all,
0EI3rSYARpQ129,36.56,37.08,  of your point without reading the slide,No
,,,  and it 's add parenthetically I agree,
,,,  you should not read directly from the,
,,,  slide but how do you remember all the,
,,,  thing you want to communicate during,
,,,  the slide ah that 's a great question,
0EI3rSYARpQ130,37.13,37.27,  that 's awesome actually so thank you is,No
,,,  so one of the thing that I 'll do is,
,,,  like right now I 'm presenting to you my,
,,,  laptop is facing me and I 've got my,
,,,  note up if I need them right so I can,
,,,  use them a point so I can go with the,
0EI3rSYARpQ131,37.29,37.41,  slide that 's coming up obviously in,No
,,,  presentation mode,
,,,  I 've been asked on the awesome with PC,
,,,  go to but I 'm just looking at the two,
,,,  and I 'll use them a that and again in,
,,,  building the presentation,
0EI3rSYARpQ132,37.42,37.53,  and we 're urging it I 'll end up going,No
,,,  back and changing with the bullet head,
,,,  by the way it 's not an absolutely if you,
,,,  have to read the point and there 's no,
,,,  way around it then you do it it 's okay,
,,,  just do n't make it a habit cuz then it,
0EI3rSYARpQ133,37.56,38.07,  over arch that so hopefully that,No
,,,  answer that question,
,,,  all right there next one I 'm the one,
,,,  font of slide the question is is n't,
,,,  there more than one font and not just,
,,,  the locos differently if you set up a,
0EI3rSYARpQ134,38.14,38.26,  template it will do it for heading and,Structure
,,,  the body itself again I try to stay with,
,,,  that one spot again unless I 'm making a,
,,,  point and again it 's not an absolute but,
,,,  I 've seen so many presentation where,
,,,  it 's got time Roman Helvetica they 're,
0EI3rSYARpQ135,38.28,38.42,  not even close and it distracts from the,No
,,,  message and again is what you 're,
,,,  comfortable with I 'm just providing you,
,,,  some guideline that I 've learned over,
,,,  year I actually went to school with the,
,,,  training exclusion for present for,
0EI3rSYARpQ136,38.45,38.59,  effective presentation and training so,No
,,,  again it 's what you 're comfortable with,
,,,  if you 're comfortable with bullet and,
,,,  use them again it 's where you need to be,
,,,  effective but great question alright our,
,,,  next one asks if your suggestion are,
0EI3rSYARpQ137,39.01,39.14,  only for board and senior management or,No
,,,  should they also be applied to any,
,,,  presentation regardless of their level,
,,,  excellent,
,,,  yes and yes and yes the presentation,
,,,  here,
0EI3rSYARpQ138,39.15,39.26,  the presentation I do for my board are,Structure
,,,  always the same like know who my,
,,,  audience is going to be I know what my,
,,,  message is going to be I do n't build it,
,,,  out so any of my previous and future,
,,,  presentation are always going to follow,
0EI3rSYARpQ139,39.28,39.46,  these guideline and I break them myself,Structure
,,,  so yeah absolutely all right the next,
,,,  attendee say you use some great image,
,,,  in your presentation where did you find,
,,,  them all did you just start googling the,
,,,  meaning or is there one or two place,
0EI3rSYARpQ140,39.47,40.02,  you go to actually I use dr. Google a,No
,,,  extensively and then what I 'm looking,
,,,  for you,
,,,  is a PNG file it will have a transparent,
,,,  background I do a lot of Photoshop work,
,,,  so that I can take my image into,
0EI3rSYARpQ141,40.05,40.16,  Photoshop and utilize them a well so,No
,,,  for example but thank you I a you see,
,,,  here it 's a little pixelated but I,
,,,  could n't find it any better other than,
,,,  doing it myself our challenge and,
,,,  image is a lot of them will have a,
0EI3rSYARpQ142,40.19,40.32,  watermark to pay for them right you got,No
,,,  to buy those but if you click view,
,,,  similar and start to refine your search,
,,,  you 'll find them so it absolutely is you,
,,,  know it 's basically Google if you have a,
,,,  medium department in your organization,
0EI3rSYARpQ143,40.34,40.5,  you 're that fortunate usable I when,No
,,,  you 're in a team presentation if one of,
,,,  the presenter state something,
,,,  incorrectly you have any suggestion on,
,,,  how you might correct them or add to,
,,,  what they say to help make it accurate,
0EI3rSYARpQ144,40.52,41.14,  oh politically question first of,Structure
,,,  all when governor thank you I 'm sorry,
,,,  it 's a politically charged question do I,
,,,  want to be General Custer on this one do,
,,,  I let it go doe it change the rest of,
,,,  the presentation it really is going to,
0EI3rSYARpQ145,41.17,41.3,  depend on the situation that 's a really,Structure
,,,  hard one and I 've done team,
,,,  presentation with my own organization I,
,,,  think we refine me or I may just let it,
,,,  go again it really depends on where we,
,,,  are in the in the in the field or the,
0EI3rSYARpQ146,41.32,41.47,  deck all right this next one say when,No
,,,  right on this next one now when training,
,,,  and I have to excuse me back it up a,
,,,  little bit here to get from the,
,,,  beginning oh when training how do you,
,,,  address people who are on their laptop,
0EI3rSYARpQ147,41.49,42.02,  or phone or read to re their,No
,,,  attention training all the manager in,
,,,  my department this person say they have,
,,,  a terrible habit of tuning out and being,
,,,  a level lower addressing this is a bit,
,,,  sensitive okay so what I 'll do is,
0EI3rSYARpQ148,42.08,42.19,  usually say at the beginning,Structure
,,,  the presentation I 've got a lot of,
,,,  material or kind of make note of it you,
,,,  material or kind of make note of it you,
,,,  know I appreciate it you can silence put,
,,,  your phone down and close your laptop 's,
,,,  so that I 'm able to provide a more,
0EI3rSYARpQ149,42.21,42.33,  effective presentation I 'm putting it on,No
,,,  me I 'm able to provide a more effective,
,,,  presentation that will resound with you,
,,,  I kind of put it I mean I did n't tell,
,,,  you to do it I 've asked gently and,
,,,  nicely so you can make that your own,
0EI3rSYARpQ150,42.35,42.49,  word but that 's a challenge I do well I,No
,,,  did a presentation in the Pacific Rim,
,,,  and they all I did n't see any eye and I,
,,,  thought it wa like my presentation I,
,,,  learned that that 's a cultural piece so,
,,,  again it 's what 's my level of exception,
0EI3rSYARpQ151,42.53,43.12,  threshold of pain okay our next one how,No
,,,  do you make all of your point without,
,,,  bullet any hint tip yes so let 's,
,,,  let 's go back right I 'm gon na go back in,
,,,  here I just turned the bullet the bullet,
,,,  point off here and what I do is all,
0EI3rSYARpQ152,43.16,43.32,  cheat a well I 'll open that up because,No
,,,  that bullet take about a full font,
,,,  that bullet take about a full font,
,,,  letter away so for example if I have the,
,,,  audience is here for a reason it wo n't,
,,,  fit so again it 's a style thing I 've,
,,,  actually gone through might have some,
0EI3rSYARpQ153,43.34,43.49,  way older stuff and if I 'm you reusing,No
,,,  it or rebuilding it and I take it away,
,,,  sometimes again I 'll leave it in it 's a,
,,,  comfort level alright and could you,
,,,  please repeat the name of the site where,
,,,  you get your slide um do n't be,
0EI3rSYARpQ154,43.55,44.06,  available through ACP correct,No
,,,  Jim no I mean the one the one do I,
,,,  think they mean the one that you use in,
,,,  your PowerPoint uh again I 'll hand this,
,,,  down these are actually hyperlink a,
,,,  well but the big one that Department of,
0EI3rSYARpQ155,44.09,44.2,  Homeland Security and they 've changed,No
,,,  like Tessa Tessa ha n't done a lot but,
,,,  God ha done quite a bit so there 's a,
,,,  lot more out there but again it just,
,,,  sent me an email,
,,,  I 'll tell you the deck and I 'll expose,
0EI3rSYARpQ156,44.22,44.35,  the hyperlink,No
,,,  I write for the image themselves if you,
,,,  look at the number of image there 's,
,,,  probably about a hundred image here I,
,,,  do n't keep track of where I get them I,
,,,  usually take them all that it 's own,
0EI3rSYARpQ157,44.37,44.52,  clean them up and I just throw them in,No
,,,  that 's the difficult if you have a,
,,,  specific want you me an email and I 'd,
,,,  be more than happy to see if I swear I,
,,,  got it from all right the next question,
,,,  asks do you share your note and talk,
0EI3rSYARpQ158,44.55,45.05,  track with the audience after the,No
,,,  presentation and if not how do you,
,,,  ensure that they have all the,
,,,  information that you verbally shared ah,
,,,  great question,
,,,  first of all they get recorded like this,
0EI3rSYARpQ159,45.07,45.2,  when she doe it I 've stopped depending,No
,,,  on the presentation,
,,,  there 'll be sporadic note that are in,
,,,  there so if they want the slide you,
,,,  do n't give them them with the note but,
,,,  more often it it 's this type of effect,
0EI3rSYARpQ160,45.22,45.34,  where you know having that benefit of,No
,,,  being a member of a CP you have access,
,,,  to it at any time on and again it,
,,,  slide were there a well so I again the,
,,,  more you do the presentation and,
,,,  present the le you use your note a,
0EI3rSYARpQ161,45.37,45.53,  you go okay our next one is X what asks,Structure
,,,  what is the best way to gain interaction,
,,,  or awareness if you feel the room is,
,,,  dead do you recommend calling someone,
,,,  out with a question to help gain some,
,,,  traction ah calling somebody out buy,
0EI3rSYARpQ162,45.57,46.16,  by individual can be deadly especially,No
,,,  if they 're not paying attention so uh,
,,,  stop they so I have a question for you,
,,,  in the audience so alright so I now,
,,,  telling them to pay attention let me ask,
,,,  you you know in doing a presentation and,
0EI3rSYARpQ163,46.2,46.33,  I 'll look over in this direction but I,No
,,,  wo n't ask anybody there 's anybody here,
,,,  think that the color are too bad when,
,,,  the background make a difference right,
,,,  so um but I 've got to be prepared and it,
,,,  may be you over here go great doe,
0EI3rSYARpQ164,46.35,46.48,  anybody else want to comment,No
,,,  so it again it go back to engaging the,
,,,  audience,
,,,  when I present I take question a they,
,,,  come but that again come with time and,
,,,  practice and failure where you 're now,
0EI3rSYARpQ165,46.53,47.08,  sweating on the stage because somebody 's,No
,,,  dominating it you do n't know how to get,
,,,  it back it 's like being a comedian right,
,,,  the heckler so that 's good that 's a good,
,,,  one hopefully the house there 's a little,
,,,  curiosity a to why you object to the,
0EI3rSYARpQ166,47.1,47.3,  use of bullet point ah for me it 's just,No
,,,  keeping the slide cleaner there seems to,
,,,  be a trend in professional presenter,
,,,  there 's another one bullet point are,
,,,  for kitten there 's a couple of you know,
,,,  if you actually look out there so again,
0EI3rSYARpQ167,47.32,47.46,  it 's all personal preference I 'm,No
,,,  presenting I want my material to look a,
,,,  little differently a well and again I 'm,
,,,  using a large spot I want a much of,
,,,  that screen a I can use see that 's why,
,,,  in again you notice I do n't have a lot,
0EI3rSYARpQ168,47.48,48,  of sub I 'll use those a talking,Structure
,,,  point in my title of my draft I 'll use,
,,,  them a I can talk and present practice,
,,,  it but then I go back and I 'll remove,
,,,  them because they become talking point,
,,,  one of those logic talk about I write,
0EI3rSYARpQ169,48.02,48.16,  you you guy immediately went to that,No
,,,  visualization of the eye because I,
,,,  mentioned that and you remember that but,
,,,  I had in there talking about it instills,
,,,  confidence I took it out because I knew,
,,,  what I wanted to do America nursing so,
0EI3rSYARpQ170,48.18,48.32,  again bullet point again it 's personal,No
,,,  everybody want to feel comfortable in,
,,,  their presentation and I thought the,
,,,  bullet for the NRA wa a cute one and,
,,,  how do you keep your audience engaged,
,,,  during a web or a screen share session,
0EI3rSYARpQ171,48.35,48.48,  oh these are the hardest I will tell you,No
,,,  better brighten that up and that is one,
,,,  of the thing is changing it up is if,
,,,  I 'm presenting I wanted you to see me,
,,,  and it 's why because talking to a webcam,
,,,  or a speaker,
0EI3rSYARpQ172,48.5,49.03,  is very difficult there 's no there 's no,No
,,,  way around it you know people are on,
,,,  email they 're on Facebook while you 're,
,,,  doing this you do n't know and again,
,,,  that 's where the rehearsal it 's got to,
,,,  be comfortable in that you 're like I,
0EI3rSYARpQ173,49.06,49.2,  find when I do a webinar I 'm actually,No
,,,  talking faster cuz I do n't have anybody,
,,,  in the room so but we were not in my,
,,,  office today I have an audience,
,,,  did you again not going to need an,
,,,  anchor but it 's going to keep my pace,
0EI3rSYARpQ174,49.23,49.36,  where it is if I 'm using them a engaged,No
,,,  but webinars are the hardest when they,
,,,  CP asked me to do this I 've done this,
,,,  for them in person in the national my,
,,,  marketing team did a great immediate,
,,,  communication she did an awesome job of,
0EI3rSYARpQ175,49.38,49.51,  setting it up in this way so that I,Structure
,,,  could do it all the way sitting at my,
,,,  desk is difficult well here 's a good one,
,,,  how do you keep track if the audience,
,,,  ask question a you 're going along this,
,,,  person that say he or she tends to lose,
0EI3rSYARpQ176,49.55,50.1,  the trail of thought with all the,No
,,,  interruption from the audience,
,,,  ah so two thing on the podium or near,
,,,  the podium I have my phone with a timer,
,,,  so I 'm watching the clock I 'm not doing,
,,,  that I know how long this take but what,
0EI3rSYARpQ177,50.14,50.25,  I 'll do is hey that 's great I 'll kind of,No
,,,  bring it back in by saying you know can,
,,,  we table that here can you talk to me,
,,,  afterwards about it cuz I know where I 'm,
,,,  at with my debt I can see my powerpoint,
,,,  I know what my next slide is and they,
0EI3rSYARpQ178,50.28,50.41,  need to bring it back in,No
,,,  sometimes it 's graceful it 's not sort of,
,,,  graceful but you know it 's inner you,
,,,  know what interest of respecting your,
,,,  time can we hold question to the end,
,,,  but I like the finish the presentation,
0EI3rSYARpQ179,50.44,50.56,  and I know it 's great please write them,Structure
,,,  down or let 's hold them to the end,
,,,  so again again taking that control back,
,,,  recognizing what they want and it is,
,,,  important I 'm looking at somebody right,
,,,  now make that sense that again notice,
0EI3rSYARpQ180,50.59,51.1,  my hand gesture I 'm going like this I 'm,No
,,,  being open I 'm wrecking my,
,,,  that person they 're actually smiling at,
,,,  me so it make it show that that we 're,
,,,  good and if they 're not to my man it 's,
,,,  gon na keep going anyway,
0EI3rSYARpQ181,51.12,51.24,  but again use your time allocated,No
,,,  recognized always recognize that the,
,,,  question and it is decide whether you,
,,,  need to answer it or defer it and then,
,,,  just say hey I have a lot of question,
,,,  this is great I 'm excited about that,
0EI3rSYARpQ182,51.26,51.43,  but we need to get through this,Structure
,,,  presentation let 's hold them to the end,

ryXOW1QS0ZM1,0.06,0.23,  For seven year I presented the news,No
,,,  on television and every thursday I wa there in front of my camera,
,,,  and I heard the director in my ear saying : Attention studio for life,
,,,  5 4 3 ...,
,,,  and every Thursday,
,,,  I felt my heart racing . Every week seven year ...,
ryXOW1QS0ZM2,0.27,0.47,  Now I tell you this because there is this huge misunderstanding,No
,,,  that experienced speaker they are not nervous . When you see that speaker on,
,,,  stage and you say like like : `` Well they do it in a natural way '',
,,,  No they do n't . They are nervous . But the difference to me,
,,,  between an experienced and inexperienced speaker is that experience people,
,,,  know how to handle the nerve . I want to give you this insight because it,
ryXOW1QS0ZM3,0.52,1.08,  really helped me a lot,No
,,,  to deal with my nerve .,
,,,  Because it all begin with the brain . That 's where my explanation begin .,
,,,  Because you have to look at your brain,
,,,  a having these different antenna,
,,,  Your brain really want to protect yourself and it take that job very seriously,
ryXOW1QS0ZM4,1.12,1.29,  So a soon a the antenna perceive a kind of danger,No
,,,  a button is pushed . It 's a button somewhere here,
,,,  in your head in your brain and it 's called the amygdala . It ha to shape,
,,,  of an almond the color of an almond .,
,,,  It is small a an almond It is a very important button,
,,,  because a soon a the button is pushed that 's what we call the fight or flight reaction,
ryXOW1QS0ZM5,1.33,1.49,  You have all these sensation in your body typically the thing that you experience,No
,,,  when you are nervous,
,,,  like a dry mouth,
,,,  Legs shaking your heart really beating very fast,
,,,  your respiration is going faster and,
,,,  this is something that actually is there to protect yourself because,
ryXOW1QS0ZM6,1.54,2.14,  a it is a fight or flight reaction imagine that there is this car,No
,,,  nearly racing into you when you when you cross a road . The fact that you have this,
,,,  Heart beat that is faster it actually prepares you,
,,,  to react and to run actually,
,,,  Now the thing is when you stand in front of an audience,
,,,  you can not run . So the antenna they do n't make a difference between,
ryXOW1QS0ZM7,2.19,2.38,  real danger and a danger in your head . So what happens is when you,No
,,,  in front of your audience you can not run you kind of freeze,
,,,  but still you have these sensation so you want to protect yourself,
,,,  now this is on a subconscious level,
,,,  what happens on a conscious level is that actually,
,,,  when you stand in front of your audience you want to protect yourselve,
ryXOW1QS0ZM8,2.42,3,  actually by doing this now this is overdoing it but,No
,,,  to some extent that 's what speaker actually do in front of an audience,
,,,  stand like that you really want to protect yourself looking down looking,
,,,  very quickly from one person to another,
,,,  Now what doe an experienced speaker do ? Exactly the opposite,
,,,  They on a conscious level,
ryXOW1QS0ZM9,3.03,3.24,  They make themselves big in front of the audience you could say that they fake it,No
,,,  making yourself big what I mean with that is,
,,,  having that posture in in front of your audience,
,,,  that give you a kind of a positive attitude . Now to know what that is,
,,,  just watch television . You can really learn a lot from it,
,,,  And I advise you to look especially at people for example presenting the news,
ryXOW1QS0ZM10,3.29,3.49,  but people standing because that 's the most difficult thing to do have to stand,No
,,,  in front of that audience what to do with your arm what to do with your leg,
,,,  just look at how they stand and imitate that,
,,,  because this is a good neutral position same thing for the way you look,
,,,  tip that I have there is that you actually look at your audience,
,,,  a if you pour them a glass of wine because this will help you,
ryXOW1QS0ZM11,3.53,4.11,  to stay with one person you look at one,No
,,,  individual at the time . The time it take,
,,,  to pour them a glass of wine . To avoid that you would either look away,
,,,  or look very nervously from one person to another,
,,,  so the next time you experience these nerve,
,,,  what I advise you to do is stand,
ryXOW1QS0ZM13,4.14,4.47,  and look it a conscious way just watch television,No
,,,  to know what that can be and watch Ted.com,
,,,  because on that website you have all these presentation with PowerPoint,
,,,  without PowerPoint,
,,,  look at it without volume because it help you to look how they stand,
,,,  What I absolutely advise you to do is watch,
,,,  Amy Cuddy she 's an expert on body language,
,,,  and this is exactly what she 's talking about about faking it,
,,,  to just have a look imitate integrate,
,,,  and make it your own .,
wd9reH4g--Y1,0.03,0.19,  hello everybody great time seems to be,No
,,,  getting lot of yes so that 's,
,,,  fantastic so welcome presentation skill,
,,,  and confidence in public speaking I 'm,
,,,  wondering what your thought are about,
,,,  what scare either you in public,
wd9reH4g--Y2,0.24,0.39,  speaking or perhaps your student and,No
,,,  what the challenge are an awkward,
,,,  nurse 'll knowledge or topic expertise or,
,,,  connection with the audience there are,
,,,  lot of issue that get in the way of,
,,,  people being really great public,
wd9reH4g--Y3,0.41,0.57,  speaker and some of the thing that I 'd,No
,,,  like to explore today are about mindset,
,,,  attitude and about our delivery style,
,,,  and how we can that take a little bit,
,,,  more control of our voice and body,
,,,  and our relationship with the audience,
wd9reH4g--Y4,0.59,1.14,  and then a little bit on content I do n't,Structure
,,,  know if any of you were present for the,
,,,  storytelling webinar that we did a few,
,,,  month ago that had quite a lot on,
,,,  narrative and content but we 'll revisit,
,,,  a little bit of those principle bit a,
wd9reH4g--Y5,1.16,1.35,  bit of that and it principle today so,No
,,,  yes three three main topic for today,
,,,  and another thing it might be helpful to,
,,,  think about is to have a topic in mind,
,,,  for yourself so that when we 're,
,,,  discussing strategy or activity or,
wd9reH4g--Y6,1.38,1.53,  idea that you might be able to apply,Structure
,,,  some of your thinking to a particular,
,,,  topic which might be about your teaching,
,,,  it might be about this very topic okay,
,,,  so,
,,,  there are the way I see it is that there,
wd9reH4g--Y7,1.58,2.13,  are three principal element that we,No
,,,  need to think about what we have,
,,,  available to u are our self a the,
,,,  presenter and of course our relationship,
,,,  with the audience and what they need and,
,,,  then the message the content and,
wd9reH4g--Y8,2.16,2.42,  everything that we do in a presentation,No
,,,  is to the end of meeting the purpose,
,,,  that we want to achieve so presentation,
,,,  are not a particularly effective time,
,,,  effective or efficient way of getting,
,,,  information across that 's obvious,
wd9reH4g--Y9,2.44,3.02,  you know requires people in a room,No
,,,  together and that is quite resource a B,
,,,  so one thing to think about is how can,
,,,  we most powerfully Drive the message,
,,,  through that we want to drive through,
,,,  and more importantly how do we help,
wd9reH4g--Y10,3.04,3.18,  people to remember them now what,No
,,,  presentation and public speaking are,
,,,  very good for is creating relationship,
,,,  with an audience,
,,,  so although audience do n't remember,
,,,  very much and that 's where we need to,
wd9reH4g--Y11,3.2,3.32,  think about how we craft the message in,No
,,,  the delivery so that we help them to,
,,,  remember what they 're grateful is,
,,,  influencing people and encouraging them,
,,,  to get on board with idea because we,
,,,  are usually either present in the room,
wd9reH4g--Y12,3.35,3.51,  with them or they can see and hear u by,No
,,,  some other mean so it 's a very special,
,,,  thing public speaking and it 's partly,
,,,  why it make people so vulnerable I,
,,,  think is because it 's all about creating,
,,,  a real relationship,
wd9reH4g--Y13,3.56,4.14,  so I 'm hoping that everybody can see in,Structure
,,,  here now in creating this relationship,
,,,  so we 've got me and the audience for the,
,,,  message and that mean that I need to be,
,,,  credible I need to be trustworthy and to,
,,,  be the right person speaking on the,
wd9reH4g--Y14,4.15,4.33,  topic and to have passion for my subject,No
,,,  I need to be aware of what the audience,
,,,  need and in content term putting those,
,,,  two together I need to be relevant so,
,,,  it 's not really good enough to just,
,,,  think about everything that we would,
wd9reH4g--Y15,4.34,4.48,  like to say on the topic we really need,Structure
,,,  to focus it down to what the audience,
,,,  need and care about and that is still,
,,,  predicated by what is the aim of this,
,,,  presentation but if the purpose so we,
,,,  always start with the purpose so there,
wd9reH4g--Y16,4.59,5.09,  are way in which we can practice,No
,,,  thinking about what an audience need,
,,,  and the kind of conversation that we,
,,,  want to have with them when they 're,
,,,  concerned from their value what are,
,,,  their priority what is their level of,
wd9reH4g--Y17,5.12,5.3,  experience and expertise in the topic,No
,,,  what is it that they need so I 've got an,
,,,  activity that you might not arrive,
,,,  yourself or with your student and it 's,
,,,  a peer activity which is about,
,,,  explaining thing to somebody who ha no,
wd9reH4g--Y18,5.33,5.53,  context they 're not the expert on this,No
,,,  topic and this is the activity and it 's,
,,,  really quite straightforward to execute,
,,,  the subtlety come in really teasing out,
,,,  whether this person from the past that,
,,,  we 're imagining we 're talking to really,
wd9reH4g--Y19,5.55,6.07,  truly understands and ha a context for,No
,,,  what we 're saying by the time we,
,,,  finished explaining so we have two,
,,,  people we choose and love an object,
,,,  between if it could,
,,,  or a microwave or a phone or an,
wd9reH4g--Y20,6.1,6.27,  aeroplane anything that would n't have,No
,,,  existed 100 200 300 year ago and your,
,,,  partner imago they are that person,
,,,  from the past and you your job is to,
,,,  help your partner to really understand,
,,,  what this piece of technology or,
wd9reH4g--Y21,6.29,6.45,  appliance or object is for and how it,No
,,,  benefit your life and how it could,
,,,  benefit their life and their job is to,
,,,  absolutely challenge and ask question,
,,,  at any point they do n't have a reference,
,,,  or do n't understand what you 're saying,
wd9reH4g--Y22,6.47,7.08,  and in that way we really have to,Structure
,,,  interrogate whether we are meeting our,
,,,  audience value system their context,
,,,  their culture and it 's a really lovely,
,,,  fun way of starting to think about what,
,,,  doe an audience need how do I step into,
wd9reH4g--Y23,7.12,7.26,  their shoe a a presenter or a public,No
,,,  speaker and in my preparation than in my,
,,,  imagination try and focus it a closely,
,,,  a I possibly can towards them so that,
,,,  we can really have a conversation that 's,
,,,  meaningful and that I 'm not just,
wd9reH4g--Y24,7.27,7.39,  blinding them with thing that they,No
,,,  do n't think are important or relevant to,
,,,  people get that can I just have a quick,
,,,  response a to whether people understand,
,,,  that activity but if not I 'll say a,
,,,  little bit more about it if I need to,
wd9reH4g--Y25,7.43,7.59,  anybody would have it in yes yes yes,No
,,,  cool that 's great that 's really great,
,,,  okay if anybody have any question of,
,,,  course we can come back to them at the,
,,,  end so okay moving on a little bit and,
,,,  thinking about u and our delivery style,
wd9reH4g--Y26,8.02,8.25,  and being confident looking and sounding,No
,,,  confident,
,,,  so we know that there are body posture,
,,,  and physical attitude that make u feel,
,,,  and look confidence and credible and,
,,,  comfortable and they involve being,
wd9reH4g--Y27,8.28,8.48,  relaxed and they involve being alert and,No
,,,  energized and they involve in an ideal,
,,,  world having quite a strong awareness of,
,,,  the impact that our physical habit have,
,,,  so I 'm just going to talk you through,
,,,  one way of starting to become aware of,
wd9reH4g--Y28,8.51,9.04,  your posture and to become centered and,No
,,,  to look confident so I 'm going to invite,
,,,  you either to try this if you can,
,,,  standing up or if not just stay in your,
,,,  chair and we will we 'll do it from there,
,,,  so start with your foot about hip,
wd9reH4g--Y29,9.09,9.2,  apart and if you 're standing obviously,No
,,,  there on the floor if you 're sitting,
,,,  really grounding your foot into the,
,,,  floor okay,
,,,  so you get a sense of of being very,
,,,  solid in the lower body and relaxing,
wd9reH4g--Y30,9.23,9.41,  your knee and unlocking any tension and,No
,,,  sitting or standing really balanced so,
,,,  you 're not slumping forward you 're not,
,,,  arching your back you 're allowing your,
,,,  spine just to really release towards the,
,,,  ceiling crown of your head floating,
wd9reH4g--Y31,9.42,9.54,  towards the ceiling so you 're thinking,No
,,,  about lengthening in height and also,
,,,  just allowing your chest to open a,
,,,  little bit and soften and so you 're,
,,,  imagining spreading a little bit width,
,,,  wise a well and your head position,
wd9reH4g--Y32,9.58,10.15,  ideally is so that your chin is more or,No
,,,  le parallel with the floor and in,
,,,  presenting coaching we do a lot of work,
,,,  on our physical body and on our face,
,,,  and our eye contact a well a our,
,,,  voice,
wd9reH4g--Y33,10.16,10.29,  because the first thing that people,No
,,,  perceive about you is what you look like,
,,,  and very small adjustment can make a,
,,,  really big difference to that so I 'm,
,,,  also going to invite you just to let,
,,,  your shoulder drop away from your ear,
wd9reH4g--Y34,10.32,10.49,  a little bit just scratch them off and,No
,,,  let them go and start to start to tune,
,,,  in to when you feel relaxed and,
,,,  comfortable and mobile and when you have,
,,,  tension in your body and start to think,
,,,  about how to let it go just relax those,
wd9reH4g--Y35,10.51,11.08,  muscle that might be holding tension,No
,,,  that make you feel and look le,
,,,  confident and comfortable than perhaps,
,,,  you could be and little illustration of,
,,,  what that might look like so,
,,,  our chat on on the left there who 's,
wd9reH4g--Y36,11.11,11.23,  slumping forward and looking really,No
,,,  under energized and our chap on the,
,,,  right who 's looking a little bit formal,
,,,  and stiff maybe overcompensating and,
,,,  then just thinking about the one in the,
,,,  middle who 's just adjusting nicely and,
wd9reH4g--Y37,11.25,11.39,  who is standing in a really comfortable,No
,,,  body posture and softening their neck,
,,,  and growing towards the ceiling so you,
,,,  can practice that and you can practice,
,,,  it with your student and it 's really,
,,,  worth just observing when people look,
wd9reH4g--Y38,11.44,12.06,  comfortable because also it link to how,No
,,,  we feel inside now this is a picture of,
,,,  a Lee cubby showing a power pose she 's,
,,,  done a wonderful TED talk called body language,
,,,and you can go and have a look,
,,,  at that yourselves but what she 's,
wd9reH4g--Y39,12.08,12.18,  talking about she 's a social scientist,No
,,,  and what she 's talking about is the fact,
,,,  that we know that how we feel affect,
,,,  what we look like and how we carry,
,,,  ourselves but they 've done a big study,
,,,  on the fact that how we physically hold,
wd9reH4g--Y40,12.22,12.35,  ourselves and put my arm up in the air,No
,,,  now because that 's a classic power pose,
,,,  that 's what athlete do when they cross,
,,,  the line it 's a Vic,
,,,  suppose that by preparing by habitually,
,,,  going into strong power pose taking up,
wd9reH4g--Y41,12.37,12.51,  a lot of room it radically effect on an,No
,,,  unconscious level our readiness and,
,,,  confidence and our ability to succeed or,
,,,  get through interview well we 'll get,
,,,  through speech and present,
,,,  presentation well so again that 's,
wd9reH4g--Y42,12.54,13.05,  something I 'm going to invite you to try,No
,,,  out for yourself and with your student,
,,,  is play with confident posture before,
,,,  you have to speak just get yourself into,
,,,  some really powerful pose for a while,
,,,  and see how it make you feel and see if,
wd9reH4g--Y43,13.07,13.19,  it make a difference,No
,,,  again just checking in doe everybody,
,,,  doe that make sense to people just give,
,,,  me a few yes if it doe fabulous,
,,,  that 's lovely,
,,,  okay I 'm disconnect to our breathing in,
wd9reH4g--Y44,13.23,13.41,  term of presentation and calm and mind,No
,,,  management and voice control breathing,
,,,  is really key now you may well be very,
,,,  familiar with breathing exercise,
,,,  already but very briefly I just want you,
,,,  to think about your own breath and,
wd9reH4g--Y45,13.45,14.03,  encouraging your breath to drop really,No
,,,  deeply into your body and so now,
,,,  everybody just let 's let 's all put a,
,,,  hand just below your sternum maybe just,
,,,  above your waist where there 's lot of,
,,,  moving to the belly and on your lower,
wd9reH4g--Y46,14.05,14.19,  rib yes drinking water is very,No
,,,  important to thank you for that and just,
,,,  to experience relaxing and letting your,
,,,  breath drop really easily not a big,
,,,  force to top up breath because that is a,
,,,  fight reaction but a nice,
wd9reH4g--Y47,14.23,14.35,  energy relaxed breath really seep into,No
,,,  your body just feel it going to where,
,,,  your hand are if somebody 's already,
,,,  done philosophy today perfect I did n't,
,,,  have time but I will later and then,
,,,  feeling the breath leave the body and,
wd9reH4g--Y48,14.37,14.55,  being aware of all those support muscle,No
,,,  that are helping,
,,,  the breath to be controlled and strong,
,,,  and consistent empowering the voice yeah,
,,,  and I think I saw somebody say and smile,
,,,  indeed so of course our face and the,
wd9reH4g--Y49,15,15.12,  muscle in the face and the throat are,No
,,,  also very much connected to not only how,
,,,  people feel about u emotionally but,
,,,  also connected to the quality of our,
,,,  voice so in smiling and releasing the,
,,,  muscle in allowing u we also brighten,
wd9reH4g--Y50,15.14,15.26,  up the voice and allows the voice to be,No
,,,  more resoce and that 's a whole other,
,,,  piece of work we 've made to talk about,
,,,  another time so relax release the breath,
,,,  use the torso muscle to support the,
,,,  voice and smile and remember that that,
wd9reH4g--Y51,15.31,15.45,  it 's much easier to show warmth in the,No
,,,  face of the voice when we 're relaxed,
,,,  it 's quite hard if we 're very tense so,
,,,  practice those facial muscle relaxing,
,,,  and the body relaxing and being alert,
,,,  okay anybody ha any question just,
wd9reH4g--Y52,15.49,16.06,  please send them in our direction,No
,,,  okay so clarity and variety I think you,
,,,  guy are probably pretty much expert on,
,,,  clarity already but let 's just think,
,,,  about what these two thing might be how,
,,,  we might most usefully think about those,
wd9reH4g--Y53,16.07,16.22,  in this context so in term of clarity,No
,,,  my take on listening to many many many,
,,,  people doing presentation is what they,
,,,  tend to lose is the end of word and,
,,,  the middle consot so I would very,
,,,  much encourage you to be listening for,
wd9reH4g--Y54,16.23,16.36,  those I 'm sure you do already but end,No
,,,  of word the middle continent and where,
,,,  we live and where we 're going to live,
,,,  word in term of clarity and one thing,
,,,  that I do a lot with my student is to,
,,,  get them to over enunciate speech and,
wd9reH4g--Y55,16.4,16.5,  text and their own material in their,No
,,,  speech before they come back to,
,,,  speaking normally just to really get,
,,,  those muscle working and exaggerate the,
,,,  vowel,
,,,  isolate the consot play with those,
wd9reH4g--Y56,16.53,17.05,  isolate the vowel play with those to,No
,,,  get more space in,
,,,  to the mouth and we 'll look at a piece,
,,,  of text in just a moment and what we,
,,,  might want to do with that in term of,
,,,  practice variety we all know that one of,
wd9reH4g--Y57,17.09,17.21,  the thing that people ca n't bear is,No
,,,  monotonous voice so how do we get music,
,,,  into our voice well obviously we can,
,,,  play with pitch we can play with,
,,,  emphasis and punctuation we can play,
,,,  with different pacing within the,
wd9reH4g--Y58,17.26,17.41,  phrasing and it is just how to define,No
,,,  content everything okay we 'll talk about,
,,,  eye contact and at the end for soon,
,,,  thank you we 'll hold that thought,
,,,  so I 've just got this extract from,
,,,  Martin Luther King 's I have a dream,
wd9reH4g--Y59,17.43,17.55,  speech here and if we were practicing on,No
,,,  this and other text I would invite you,
,,,  to look at which of the important word,
,,,  in every in the phrase which of the,
,,,  phrase that need more emphasis,
,,,  how do those have that repetition play,
wd9reH4g--Y60,17.59,18.11,  into not only the wonderful construction,Structure
,,,  of the speech but how do you register I,
,,,  have a dream differently the second time,
,,,  from the first time and then the third,
,,,  time from the second time and the fourth,
,,,  time from the third time what are,
wd9reH4g--Y61,18.13,18.29,  different image in there that your,No
,,,  voice reflects with different color and,
,,,  tone and energy and when you when you,
,,,  can see the picture that he 's,
,,,  describing what doe that do to your,
,,,  storytelling to them to your vocal,
wd9reH4g--Y62,18.31,18.47,  quality and how do you get those,No
,,,  different emotion across with your,
,,,  voice hope fear sadness joy I would,
,,,  really encourage you to take text very,
,,,  different text apart bit by bit and,
,,,  play with them play with them with all,
wd9reH4g--Y63,18.5,19.01,  kind of different information and,No
,,,  stress emphasis and have fun,
,,,  and of course child 's story are,
,,,  perfect for this a well because then we,
,,,  can do the voice and we can do the,
,,,  different character but really focus on,
wd9reH4g--Y64,19.04,19.17,  how much color can I put into my voice,No
,,,  so that it feel natural and authentic,
,,,  and not overplayed but so that the,
,,,  muscle are really working quite hard,
,,,  most of u use very little range,
,,,  compared to what is available to u so,
wd9reH4g--Y65,19.22,19.35,  at this point if we 're thinking about,No
,,,  people who do it really well I 'm going,
,,,  to invite you just to throw in some,
,,,  idea about who you think are wonderful,
,,,  speaker and what it is that 's wonderful,
,,,  about them what are they doing that is,
wd9reH4g--Y66,19.37,19.58,  so special it 's just quick and quick,No
,,,  response here yeah we 've got anybody,
,,,  coming back on that who doe it,
,,,  wonderful well Stephen Fry paint the,
,,,  picture fabulous yes thank you Jeremy,
,,,  Harmer always interesting up to point I,
wd9reH4g--Y67,20,20.13,  do n't know who Jeremy Harmar is so thank,No
,,,  you and it 's a nice feeling yes,
,,,  absolutely Golden Circle Barack Obama,
,,,  Ken Robinson lovely to Churchill great,
,,,  give u a couple of idea about what it,
,,,  is that you love about them why are they,
wd9reH4g--Y68,20.16,20.31,  so great drawing on what we 've talked,Structure
,,,  about so far and anything else that,
,,,  you 've already thought about them,
,,,  what 's great about those people is yet,
,,,  their content is it their delivery is it,
,,,  their attitude okay we 'll pick up on,
wd9reH4g--Y69,20.37,20.5,  some of these because I 'm not seeing,No
,,,  anything come back just yet in a little,
,,,  while let 's come back to those at the,
,,,  end great so we 've been thinking about,
,,,  element of delivery and now I want to,
,,,  think briefly about element of content,
wd9reH4g--Y70,20.53,21.09,  so we know that human being need the,Structure
,,,  element of the argument that is logical,
,,,  and and coherence and ha a narrative,
,,,  and we also need anecdote and feeling,
,,,  and story and in,
,,,  both of these really have to be there in,
wd9reH4g--Y71,21.12,21.27,  our content okay so the fact we talked,No
,,,  about narrative strand is prison the,
,,,  storytelling webinar I invite you if you,
,,,  were n't there to go and have a look at,
,,,  it on the website and so what are my key,
,,,  message what are the key message the,
wd9reH4g--Y72,21.3,21.44,  chapter that lead towards the purpose,Structure
,,,  the objective but I want to get to what,
,,,  kind of evidence do I need to back it up,
,,,  what make me look credible in that,
,,,  sense of being logical and knowledgeable,
,,,  and then what is going to make the,
wd9reH4g--Y73,21.47,22,  audience come on board from an emotional,Structure
,,,  point of view what are these human,
,,,  story that I can tell that make this,
,,,  meaningful and relevance and specific to,
,,,  the audience those are my question now,
,,,  one way of exploring this and this is,
wd9reH4g--Y74,22.03,22.14,  something I mentioned last time a really,No
,,,  simple activity again maybe for your,
,,,  student is to think about the fact if,
,,,  you were describing a journey that you,
,,,  take whatever fact that your audience,
,,,  need to understand how to undertake,
wd9reH4g--Y75,22.17,22.32,  that journey themselves okay so top top,Structure
,,,  your pair partner through it and see if,
,,,  they can picture that journey from A to,
,,,  Z knowing how they 'd undertake it,
,,,  themselves and get safely to their,
,,,  destination and then pare down those,
wd9reH4g--Y76,22.35,22.48,  instruction to the fewest possible the,No
,,,  key message what are the chapter,
,,,  heading then what are the what are the,
,,,  key moment that they still need to,
,,,  understand to get them to their,
,,,  destination now we add in the,
wd9reH4g--Y77,22.53,23.07,  interesting feature that they might,Structure
,,,  experience along the way maybe a,
,,,  wonderful building or an interesting,
,,,  person or a tree or a lovely pavement or,
,,,  a beautiful anything that is going to,
,,,  spark their imagination that make them,
wd9reH4g--Y78,23.09,23.25,  want to undertake that journey what is,No
,,,  wonderful and interesting about this,
,,,  journey those are the heart moment,
,,,  those are the,
,,,  color element in your story and we need,
,,,  color we need to bring this to life this,
wd9reH4g--Y79,23.29,23.51,  message to life with something that is,No
,,,  not only relevant but colorful visual,
,,,  exciting intriguing so we start with the,
,,,  purpose we establish our chapter and we,
,,,  add color to each chapter along the way,
,,,  and this is a summary of one way of,
wd9reH4g--Y80,23.55,24.09,  thinking about how to construct an,Structure
,,,  outline so in the beginning section good,
,,,  idea to grab the audience 's attention a,
,,,  we know they do n't remember very much,
,,,  and they 're much more likely to listen,
,,,  carefully if you say something that is,
wd9reH4g--Y81,24.12,24.24,  meaningful to them right at the,Structure
,,,  beginning something surprising something,
,,,  intriguing something exciting sell the,
,,,  benefit to them really early on if you,
,,,  want to establish your credential right,
,,,  at the beginning that 's fine but I would,
wd9reH4g--Y82,24.25,24.38,  do it after the attention and,No
,,,  the benefit and your credential are,
,,,  what give you the right to talk you,
,,,  do n't have to have a PhD in the topic,
,,,  but you do have to care about it very,
,,,  much and if you want to you might tell,
wd9reH4g--Y83,24.42,24.52,  them how you 're going to approach the,Structure
,,,  topic if you want to you need to be,
,,,  clear about your key message in the,
,,,  middle the chapter heading you need to,
,,,  be clear about keeping their attention,
,,,  with color and we really need a summary,
wd9reH4g--Y84,24.56,25.14,  and the conclusion at the end because we,Structure
,,,  find it hard to remember thing so make,
,,,  it a easy a you possibly can for u,
,,,  and help u to remember your most,
,,,  important message a you a you conclude,
,,,  okay,
wd9reH4g--Y85,25.18,25.35,  one more checklist for you thinking,Structure
,,,  about head and heart I 've got something,
,,,  that I find really useful here so on the,
,,,  head side we 've got that 's the top row,
,,,  hard fact and data check so the people,
,,,  who want expertise in the audience that,
wd9reH4g--Y86,25.36,25.49,  you 've got some hard fact and data in,Structure
,,,  there check for the people who want to,
,,,  know what they have to do and like to,
,,,  see action and purpose check that your,
,,,  purpose is really clear and that people,
,,,  know which action are required on the,
wd9reH4g--Y87,25.53,26.04,  lower level understanding of the,No
,,,  audience demonstrates that you 've,
,,,  stepped into their shoe China some way,
,,,  of showing that you 've thought about,
,,,  their concern but if they need,
,,,  reassurance you can be assure them if,
wd9reH4g--Y88,26.07,26.18,  there are feeling they might be,No
,,,  experiencing in relation to the topic,
,,,  reference them and down on the bottom,
,,,  right imagination what are the anecdote,
,,,  what are the image that bring this,
,,,  material and this topic and these,
wd9reH4g--Y89,26.21,26.39,  message really vividly to life search,No
,,,  the story search for picture and,
,,,  though the word in that corner is,
,,,  imagine if ok and then and and how you,
,,,  scatter those through your presentation,
,,,  how you you might use them a individual,
wd9reH4g--Y90,26.42,26.56,  chapter will obviously depend on the,Structure
,,,  audience and the message and the,
,,,  context ok so finally this look a bit,
,,,  like an activity that we referenced last,
,,,  time,
,,,  it 's another lovely activity your,
wd9reH4g--Y91,26.58,27.14,  student is in pair when they 've got,No
,,,  their material ready is to one of them,
,,,  if the speaker and the other one either,
,,,  say tell me more if they need more,
,,,  color at that point or move on if they,
,,,  want to hear some more of the story the,
wd9reH4g--Y92,27.18,27.31,  narrative the fact and that you can you,No
,,,  can play with that a a co coaching,
,,,  exercise so you 're either saying okay,
,,,  move on I 've got it or no tell me more,
,,,  to encourage them to,
,,,  to put in more description and color and,
wd9reH4g--Y93,27.35,27.49,  so really it really tell you so much,No
,,,  about your material and when people say,
,,,  to tell me more it tends to bring u to,
,,,  life so our delivery tends to be a,
,,,  little bit more vivid and colorful and,
,,,  expressive so those wow that 's our,
wd9reH4g--Y94,27.53,28.08,  half that 's fantastic,No
,,,  um so ha anybody got any more response,
,,,  to the idea what do we think wonderful,
,,,  look like we will be a little bit more,
,,,  specific about what it is that those,
,,,  speaker that you 've referenced do,
wd9reH4g--Y95,28.1,28.27,  really well storytelling yeah thank you,No
,,,  thank you Mary Anna pacing sometimes yes,
,,,  pacing variety absolutely yet their,
,,,  personality come through it 's clear,
,,,  okay there 's a questionnaire for me,
,,,  sherry just so told it how can you apply,
wd9reH4g--Y96,28.28,28.44,  this to boring topic like ficial,No
,,,  report and presentation so the answer,
,,,  to that is apply that I 'm going to go,
,,,  back apply this slide here you know with,
,,,  those sort of boring presentation what,
,,,  the hard fact and data is but what is,
wd9reH4g--Y97,28.46,29.03,  the purpose of of conveying them to the,No
,,,  audience so there is always either a,
,,,  metaphor or a personal story that,
,,,  illustrates the benefit of this data,
,,,  this this purpose set for the audience,
,,,  and and go back to story spine go back,
wd9reH4g--Y98,29.09,29.19,  to do n't have a look at the storytelling,Structure
,,,  webinar and I think that if you were n't,
,,,  there I think that will give you some,
,,,  idea apply the story spine to your,
,,,  topic find out for yourself what the,
,,,  story is okay anything else roleplay,
wd9reH4g--Y99,29.24,29.38,  what doe that mean,No
,,,  okay interactive speech not Mormon yes,
,,,  this is all about creating relationship,
,,,  so of course you can actually create,
,,,  interaction with your audience you can,
,,,  ask them question you can ask them to,
wd9reH4g--Y100,29.4,29.55,  think about thing or you can imagine,No
,,,  that it 's a conversation all of the way,
,,,  through eye contact yes thank you for,
,,,  reminding me I contact the important,
,,,  thing with eye contact is of course ,
,,,  what if the audience is not interested,
wd9reH4g--Y101,29.56,30.11,  in the top of the tool well maybe they,No
,,,  should n't be there and they will come,
,,,  back that eye contact so the most,
,,,  important thing with eye contact is to,
,,,  make people really feel seen so I,
,,,  contact is actually a very natural,
wd9reH4g--Y102,30.14,30.26,  activity sometimes I think the easiest,No
,,,  thing to think about is that you 're,
,,,  facilitating the audience forget that,
,,,  you 're the speaker think about the fact,
,,,  that you 're looking after them,
,,,  you are a somebody ha just said thank,
wd9reH4g--Y103,30.28,30.42,  you finding common ground with them so,No
,,,  you do that through empathizing with,
,,,  them  imagining what they need in term,
,,,  of of the material but you also make,
,,,  sure that you really see them and you 're,
,,,  really talking to them and there are all,
wd9reH4g--Y104,30.46,31,  kind of technique you can use but,No
,,,  actually the most important thing to me,
,,,  is that you slow down and that you,
,,,  really really look at people when you 're,
,,,  speaking and you can include a lot of,
,,,  people if you have a large audience in,
wd9reH4g--Y105,31.02,31.16,  your peripheral eye contact but do n't,No
,,,  fake it or it becomes like a tennis,
,,,  match now just really really speak to,
,,,  them and your eye contact will work,
,,,  anything else,
,,,  Han River yeah and the biggest gift you,
wd9reH4g--Y106,31.19,31.3,  can give to yourself in term of your,No
,,,  gesture is to relax your arm and hand,
,,,  and then they will help you the more you,
,,,  relax the more you really imagine what,
,,,  you 're talking about,
,,,  the more your gesture will automatically,
wd9reH4g--Y107,31.32,31.45,  reflect what you 're trying to say and,No
,,,  the move that you 're trying to create,
,,,  usually what get in the way of natural,
,,,  gesture is tension and awkwardness,
,,,  habit so while you 're practicing your,
,,,  posture and your alignment and your,
wd9reH4g--Y108,31.47,32,  relax relaxation include your arm in,No
,,,  your hand in that allow them just to,
,,,  rest by your side until it 's time for,
,,,  them to come to life but try to avoid,
,,,  the need to clasp them in front of your,
,,,  body or behind your body there anything,
wd9reH4g--Y109,32.04,32.12,  else anybody want to know yes,No
,,,  absolutely involved in with you Carol,
,,,  what would you suggest to the presenter,
,,,  about asking their audience to put in a,
,,,  short feedback form to their future,
,,,  improvement who I 'm wondering what do,
wd9reH4g--Y110,32.16,32.3,  you mean  the by busy presenter I mean,No
,,,  I would always I would always have a,
,,,  mental feedback form for yourself,
,,,  and if you 're talking about your,
,,,  student yeah for sure I have a,
,,,  checklist about how connected they felt,
wd9reH4g--Y111,32.32,32.42,  to the material and how how they felt,No
,,,  their pacing went and how they thought,
,,,  they were expressive in body language,
,,,  I 'm not sure if that answer your,
,,,  question,
,,,  sure other audience question with we 've,
wd9reH4g--Y112,32.44,33.01,  mentioned that and great lovely how do,No
,,,  we get your PowerPoint slide we 've not,
,,,  having enough time to make all necessary,
,,,  screen shot I 'm going to hand that,
,,,  question back to Henry anything,
,,,  technical up Thank You Henry they will,
wd9reH4g--Y113,33.04,33.19,  be available fantastic do not read,No
,,,  script never read script,
,,,  never you 're so right okay on note and,
,,,  prompt please do not use your,
,,,  PowerPoint slide a prompt please know,
,,,  your story so that for the most part all,
wd9reH4g--Y114,33.22,33.37,  you need are small two,No
,,,  I would ask you unless you absolutely,
,,,  have to please never have to read a,
,,,  script but do have any quote that you,
,,,  want to get perfectly right in front of,
,,,  you maybe on a small card any using find,
wd9reH4g--Y115,33.41,33.54,  way of prompting yourself in any way,No
,,,  that you need to but do n't have too many,
,,,  should you learn your story by heart,
,,,  know you should know your story what is,
,,,  the story behind what you 're saying,
,,,  if so if you do have something you want,
wd9reH4g--Y116,34.01,34.15,  to get completely WordPerfect then yes,Structure
,,,  learn it or have it written down if you,
,,,  really need to but but otherwise if you,
,,,  really understand you 'll be giving your,
,,,  middle and an end you should n't need too,
,,,  many prompt somebody said should you,
wd9reH4g--Y117,34.2,34.36,  leave question until the end um I I,Structure
,,,  think it really depends on how urgent,
,,,  the question are but if you whatever,
,,,  stage you choose to take question and I,
,,,  would try and control that because,
,,,  otherwise you can have people really,
wd9reH4g--Y118,34.38,34.5,  interrupting your flow all the way,Structure
,,,  through come back to your conclusion,
,,,  after you 've taken QA because we want,
,,,  you to have the last word and we want,
,,,  your key message to be the last thing,
,,,  people remember so take Q & A whenever you,
wd9reH4g--Y119,34.54,35.11,  think it 's most appropriate but have,Structure
,,,  another summary afterwards any tip for,
,,,  quick preparation before a speech my,
,,,  quickest tip would be use this checklist,
,,,  that I decide I still got up I agree I,
,,,  think you should rehearse I think if you,
wd9reH4g--Y120,35.13,35.25,  possibly can people avoid rehearsal,No
,,,  because it make them uncomfortable but,
,,,  I do n't think anybody is a better,
,,,  speaker without any any rehearsal and,
,,,  practice practice practice,
,,,  absolutely and practice with a partner,
wd9reH4g--Y121,35.29,35.44,  a well get them to give you feedback,No
,,,  try the moving on or tell me more,
,,,  exercise get them to tell you what they,
,,,  remember it might not be what you expect,
,,,  get them to tell you the feeling that,
,,,  the experience you were speaking that,
wd9reH4g--Y122,35.45,35.59,  might not not be what you expect and in,No
,,,  term of building confidence oh yeah can,
,,,  you repeat the essence of tell me one,
,,,  more thing pick you up let 's get back,
,,,  for that slide so you 've got your,
,,,  presentation material and actually you,
wd9reH4g--Y123,36.01,36.12,  can do this exercise at any stage when,Structure
,,,  it,
,,,  it went when you 're at the beginning of,
,,,  constructing it all where do you think,
,,,  it 's pretty much fully formed and with a,
,,,  partner or partner start to deliver,
wd9reH4g--Y124,36.17,36.34,  your presentation and when they want a,Structure
,,,  little bit more color or detail all they,
,,,  do is say tell me more and this flesh is,
,,,  out the story that you 're telling or,
,,,  the description that you 're giving them,
,,,  or maybe you 're describing a person a,
wd9reH4g--Y125,36.38,36.5,  character that 's relevant to your topic,No
,,,  and they want to know more they want to,
,,,  see what that person is like they want,
,,,  to know how they talk they want to,
,,,  experience their behavior that 's true,
,,,  from rehearsal something to listen to,
wd9reH4g--Y126,36.51,37,  you really improves that yeah same with,No
,,,  the lesson are simpler you 're,
,,,  absolutely right so you do n't give them,
,,,  all the blossom straightaway no you,
,,,  do n't that 's right,
,,,  you have the scatter the blossom through,
wd9reH4g--Y128,37.02,37.37,  so each each section each chapter ha,Structure
,,,  it own color story image alongside,
,,,  it you 're very very welcome thank you,
,,,  for thanking anything anybody need,
,,,  before we go great fantastic so unless,
,,,  there 's anything else I 'm going to hand,
,,,  back to Henry and guy nice thank you,
ISn4Fip9aH81,0,0.2,  The first moment of presentation are critical .,No
,,,  Let 's look at the five best way to open .,
,,,  My name is Alex Lyon and I 'm here to,
,,,  provide professional development tip for your very next meeting . Today we 're,
,,,  going to talk about presentation skill . And it 's a critical area for leader,
,,,  because people will often see someone present and if you do well they 'll think,
ISn4Fip9aH82,0.24,0.41,  oh that person is a good leader .,Structure
,,,  That 's the way people translate it . And the first moment of presentation are,
,,,  really key it 's that attention getter,
,,,  is what they call it that moment your grab your audience 's attention and you draw,
,,,  their interest in to the heart of the message you 're about to share . And there,
,,,  are some good way to start and some bad way . We 're going to look at the top 5 way to start,
ISn4Fip9aH83,0.45,1.06,  presentation . For the first is a story . And I mean a brief story like 30 second,No
,,,  to 60 second .,
,,,  It can be humorous . It can be fun light could be serious .,
,,,  Whatever match the tone of the central message you 're about to share is appropriate,
,,,  And it also should in it content drive towards the heart of the message . For,
,,,  example my pastor the other day told the story about how when he wa,
ISn4Fip9aH84,1.09,1.31,  young he wa driving this truck on the freeway . It wa a cherry picker huge truck with,No
,,,  the company logo on the side . And he missed his turn and so we had to swerve,
,,,  over the grass median . And it wa a humorous story but it drove right to the,
,,,  point wa trying to make which is about difficult choice .,
,,,  So it worked really well . So a good story a brief story is a strong way to start,
,,,  your presentation . Second way is a statistic or fact .,
ISn4Fip9aH85,1.36,1.56,  Ideally a statistic that 's startling something a little unexpected . Like I,No
,,,  heard one the other day when learning about personal fice and that is,
,,,  during college student have about eight hundred dollar worth of credit card,
,,,  debt but by the time they are in the working world they have about eight,
,,,  thousand dollar worth of credit card debt . Now to me that 's pretty startling .,
,,,  And if you were going to open a presentation about personal fice or,
ISn4Fip9aH86,1.59,2.18,  perhaps college student whatever the topic is that is an example of a good,No
,,,  statistic because it really draw your attention to the issue .,
,,,  So a you 're doing your research you 'll probably come across some,
,,,  interesting fact and you should consider some of those a introductory,
,,,  or attention material for your opening . The third way is rhetorical question .,
,,,  A rhetorical question a they say is not necessarily a question that need to be,
ISn4Fip9aH87,2.22,2.4,  answered .,Structure
,,,  However you could ask your listener to raise their hand if that they have ever,
,,,  thought that . For example say by show of hand how many of you have ever,
,,,  and then you insert your question . I think it 's a great way to start because,
,,,  it instantly get your audience participating and bought in on board,
,,,  with the message you 're sharing .,
ISn4Fip9aH88,2.41,2.59,  I think it 's also best to structure this so you asked two possibly three,Structure
,,,  question in a row so it add a little momentum to the message . And that way,
,,,  it 's not just a one kind of question,
,,,  it 's something that draw them that draw them in . The fourth way to open is,
,,,  an illustration .,
,,,  You should consider something visual that show your audience,
ISn4Fip9aH89,3.03,3.21,  the point that you 're trying to make . I once saw a speaker for example lineup,No
,,,  stack of cooky to illustrate difference in number .,
,,,  Now cooky are much more interesting to look at than just a number . So it 's a,
,,,  great visual representation .,
,,,  Sometimes people will use an object a a representation a visual,
,,,  illustration of what they 're trying to get across . Any way you can do that maybe,
ISn4Fip9aH810,3.25,3.43,  a visual aid even something on the screen could be a powerful way to start,No
,,,  something that help the visual learner in your audience to get on board with,
,,,  what you 're about to say can be a really great way to start . And the last way is,
,,,  quotation .,
,,,  Now you can start with it a well quotation but I do n't think the,
,,,  well quotation are always best .,
ISn4Fip9aH811,3.46,4.06,  It 's true the Abraham Lincoln,Structure
,,,  and Einstein they all said some amazing thing but the problem with using a,
,,,  common quotation is that people have probably already heard it . And it might,
,,,  not have the impact that you 're trying to have . I think it 's best if you look,
,,,  for a unique or off quotation . for example I saw a speaker recently give a,
,,,  quote from Bruce Lee to begin his presentation . His presentation wa n't,
ISn4Fip9aH812,4.11,4.3,  about martial art . It wa about making mistake . And Bruce Lee ha a great,Structure
,,,  quotation about making mistake and it wa a powerful way to start because I had,
,,,  never heard it before . But it wa a powerful way to open .,
,,,  so these are the top five way I recommend starting your presentation . I,
,,,  want to give you two additional suggestion for using attention getters,
,,,  effectively . And the first suggestion is to make sure it 's the very first thing,
ISn4Fip9aH813,4.34,4.55,  out of your mouth .,No
,,,  a lot of time we get introduced and then we might fill in with a whole bunch,
,,,  of other thing and then in a moment or two we finally get to our message . But I,
,,,  think the first thing out of your mouth should be your attention getter .,
,,,  You might say thank you to the applause or thank you briefly a couple of second,
,,,  and then you pause and you go into your attention getter . The second,
ISn4Fip9aH814,4.58,5.2,  recommendation to using these attention getters I think it 's great to combine,Structure
,,,  these together . You might use for example a rhetorical question with a statistic or,
,,,  a quote with a rhetorical question .,
,,,  you can there 's some art to this but you can weave them together and play around,
,,,  till you get the right combination . But if you combine more than one then you 're almost,
,,,  guaranteed to have a powerful opening that really doe n't do the job and gain,
ISn4Fip9aH815,5.24,5.38,  people 's attention .,No
,,,  So like I said presentation are often considered a leadership skill and I,
,,,  highly recommend,
,,,  developing these every chance you get . And it 's why I created Communication,
,,,  Coach . I created it to help rising leader like yourself,
,,,  take your leadership and communication skill to the next level .,
ISn4Fip9aH816,5.42,5.58,  So if you 're interested in ongoing tip in this area please subscribe to the channel,No
,,,  post your comment and question below . If you have other idea about video,
,,,  you 'd like to see me work on in the future then go ahead and we 'll start a,
,,,  conversation about that .,
,,,  So thanks . God bless . And I hope you get to use these tip at your very next,
,,,  meeting .,
2OBewm5guJk1,0,0.21,  I 'm Alex Lyon and you 're about to start a seven mini on Concise,No
,,,  Clear and Confident Communication . I put this course together because I believe,
,,,  It 's really the best first step for you in your professional development laying,
,,,  that foundation to develop strong communication skill . Moving forward I,
,,,  encourage you to watch all seven lesson .,
,,,  There 's a little practice involved in each one so you can actually hear and,
2OBewm5guJk2,0.24,0.53,  then try the idea out . Let 's jump right into the first lesson .,No
,,,  In lesson one we 're going after long . I encourage you to watch this and go,
,,,  through a many time a you need to to make this material a habit . Tip one . Long,
,,,  windedness is a key enemy of good communication . I 'm always surprised that,
,,,  really talkative people assume that they 're good communicator . But more,
,,,  talking doe not equal good communication . In fact a lot of time if,
2OBewm5guJk3,0.58,1.17,  these word  gabby chatty verbose and talkative  accurately describe you,No
,,,  it 's probably forming a bad impression . Especially in professional setting,
,,,  Alison Green said it like this . You might think well some people long winded but,
,,,  it doe n't mean he would n't do a good job .,
,,,  The problem is that a minimum is signal that you 're not good at picking up on,
,,,  conversational cue and it raise doubt about your ability to organize your,
2OBewm5guJk4,1.21,1.45,  thought and can convey needed information quickly . So strategy one resolve why you,No
,,,  sometimes talk too much . When do you find yourself multiplying word being overly,
,,,  talkative ? Is it just at work or is it social situation ? And what are your in,
,,,  the thought process that trigger it ?,
,,,  Are you insecure about something ? What 's going on in your mind that 's driving,
,,,  that over talkative habit ? Because all the tip in the world will not undo an,
2OBewm5guJk5,1.5,2.09,  unspoken belief that drive that long . So excessive,No
,,,  talkativeness is rooted in our unspoken belief,
,,,  let 's say you 're a physician and you 're thinking to yourself maybe you do n't,
,,,  realize it but you 're thinking I want people to know I 'm smart . You will most,
,,,  certainly talk too much to prove that .,
,,,  And because we live in a polite society people just play along . But inside,
2OBewm5guJk6,2.14,2.36,  they 're having an entirely different thought process about this conversation .,No
,,,  They will almost never tell you directly that you 're long however they will form,
,,,  unfavorable impression of you anyway . And so it 's very important to realize,
,,,  the impact that long communication can have on your,
,,,  professional relationship and the people around you . So people are long winded,
,,,  for various reason . What 's your reason ? Maybe there 's more than one . Is it,
2OBewm5guJk7,2.4,3.03,  insecurity ? Maybe some self ? Do you want to show everything you know,No
,,,  like you 're that physician ? Do you like the air time and attention ? In other word,
,,,  doe it feel good when people are listening to you and you love when,
,,,  everyone 's watching you in action ? Do you mistake talking for adding value ? Do,
,,,  mistake more talking for good communication ? Are there some control,
,,,  issue going on in your heart in your mind ? In other word do you like to,
2OBewm5guJk8,3.07,3.28,  steer a conversation and be the one talking so you dictate the pace and the,No
,,,  flow of thing . Any one of these reason and there are many others could be,
,,,  driving that long . So it 's really important that you take some time,
,,,  and get to the bottom of it .,
,,,  Strategy number two is to gauge your long . Usually there are,
,,,  place and time when you 're not necessarily long and other time you are .,
2OBewm5guJk9,3.38,4.02,  Strategy two is to gauge your long . Rate yourself on a scale of 1 to,No
,,,  10 . If you 're really concise give yourself a 1 . If you 're somewhere in the middle,
,,,  depending on situation 5 . If you 're really long a 10 . And of course,
,,,  you can give yourself other score . But I would recommend setting a goal to move,
,,,  at least below 5 . Let 's say you want to be from a 1 to 4 range depending upon,
,,,  the situation . Concise strategy number three is to commit to conciseness . As FDR,
2OBewm5guJk10,4.08,4.34,  said be sincere be brief and be seated .,No
,,,  He 's talking about presentation it sound like . But I think this demonstrates,
,,,  his commitment to conciseness . Because conciseness really set the stage for,
,,,  that clarity and that confidence that we 're all after . And so commitment in,
,,,  this sense mean practicing the tip in this video in the next six lesson . And,
,,,  while you 're doing and remember why you want to be concise clear and confident .,
2OBewm5guJk11,4.38,5.03,  Here are some reason . People will pay attention to what you say when you,No
,,,  communicate this way . People remember what you say . You 'll have more impact . And,
,,,  you can lead more effectively . So there are lot of good reason to do so .,
,,,  So long this is a key enemy to good communication . Some take strategy .,
,,,  Resolve why you sometimes talk too much . Then gauge your long to,
,,,  help you set that goal . And then commit to practicing the tip in this lesson,
2OBewm5guJk13,5.07,5.42,  and the remaining six lesson . So your first step is get to the bottom of your,No
,,,  unspoken reason for long . That will really catapult you through this,
,,,  course and help you apply these tip with much more effectiveness . Looking,
,,,  forward we 'll work on how to form a concise overall message concise,
,,,  sentence we 'll work on organizing your thought effective pause avoiding,
,,,  filler and confident nonverbals . If you have n't yet subscribed to this channel,
,,,  Communication Coach I encourage you to do so . And I look forward to seeing you,
,,,  in the next lesson .,
a5KYlHNKQB81,0.02,0.2,  Layout and composition .,No
,,,  In a way they 're the foundation of design .,
,,,  They give your work structure and make it easier to navigate from the margin on the,
,,,  side ... to the content in between .,
,,,  Of course it 's not just about working with text .,
,,,  Composition matter in other medium too like graphic design web design and much,
a5KYlHNKQB82,0.25,0.44,  more .,No
,,,  Without a well layout your work would basically ... fall apart .,
,,,  The key to mastering layout and composition is to think like a designer .,
,,,  Luckily it 's easier than it sound .,
,,,  There are five basic principle that can help you transform your work and sharpen your eye,
,,,  for design .,
a5KYlHNKQB83,0.45,1.1,  Let 's start at the top and work our way down .,No
,,,  Proximity is all about using visual space to show relationship in your content .,
,,,  In practice it 's pretty simple?all you have to do is make sure related item are,
,,,  grouped together ; for example block of text or element in a graphic .,
,,,  Groups that are not related to each other should be separated to visually emphasize,
,,,  their lack of a relationship .,
a5KYlHNKQB84,1.12,1.36,  All in all this make your work easier to understand at a glance?whether it 's purely,No
,,,  text or something more visual .,
,,,  White space is an important part of every composition .,
,,,  Now this doe n't mean literal `` white space '' ?it just mean negative space like the space,
,,,  between your content between line and even the outer margin .,
,,,  There 's no `` one way '' to use white space correctly but it 's good to understand it purpose .,
a5KYlHNKQB85,1.41,2.02,  White space help you define and separate different section ; it give your content,No
,,,  room to breath .,
,,,  If your work ever start to feel cluttered or uncomfortable? a little white space might,
,,,  be just what the doctor ordered .,
,,,  Alignment is something you deal with all the time even if you do n't realize it .,
,,,  Whenever you type an email or create a document the text is aligned automatically .,
a5KYlHNKQB86,2.07,2.26,  When aligning object by yourself ( for instance image or separate text box ) getting it,No
,,,  right can be tricky .,
,,,  The most important thing is to be consistent .,
,,,  Let 's take a look at what that mean .,
,,,  It might help to imagine your content arranged inside of a grid .,
,,,  Notice how there 's an invisible line centering each image to the text ?,
a5KYlHNKQB87,2.3,2.57,  Each grouping is also evenly spaced and aligned with equal margin .,No
,,,  It 's that attention to detail that make the composition easier to navigate .,
,,,  Without consistent alignment your work could start to feel disorganized .,
,,,  Contrast simply mean that one item is different from another .,
,,,  In layout and composition contrast can help you do many thing ; for example catch the,
,,,  reader 's eye create emphasis or call attention to something important .,
a5KYlHNKQB88,3.02,3.24,  There are lot of strategy or creating contrast .,No
,,,  You can use color ... adjust the size shape or visual weight of an object ... or use contrasting,
,,,  style of text .,
,,,  Contrast is also closely tied to hierarchy a visual technique that can help the viewer,
,,,  navigate you work .,
,,,  In other word it show them where to begin and where to go next using different level,
a5KYlHNKQB89,3.29,3.49,  of emphasis .,No
,,,  Establishing hierarchy is simple : just decide which element you want the reader to notice,
,,,  first then make them stand out .,
,,,  High or important item are usually larger bolder or more eye in some,
,,,  way .,
,,,  Repetition is a reminder that every project should have a consistent look and feel .,
a5KYlHNKQB810,3.54,4.17,  That mean finding way to reinforce your design by repeating or echoing certain element .,No
,,,  For instance if you have a specific color palette look for way to carry it through .,
,,,  If you 've chosen a special header style use it every time .,
,,,  It 's not just for aesthetic reasons?being consistent can also make your work easier,
,,,  to read .,
,,,  When the viewer know what to expect they can relax and focus on the content .,
a5KYlHNKQB811,4.26,4.55,  In many way layout and composition are the unsung hero of design .,No
,,,  It 's easy to overlook their role but they 're part of everything you do .,
,,,  A nudge here ... some extra white space there ... and voila !,
,,,  With a little attention to detail you can create beautiful professional composition .,
,,,  Thanks for joining u for the basic of layout and composition .,
,,,  Check out the rest of our design topic including typography color and image .,
a7nz55f9MUY1,0.05,0.16,  well it 's probably getting time for you,No
,,,  to deliver your first full speech have,
,,,  you thought about what you 're going to,
,,,  take with you to the podium,
,,,  to help you remember your speech well,
,,,  you may be thinking gon na take your,
a7nz55f9MUY2,0.18,0.29,  formal outline with you if you do I got,Structure
,,,  some news for you that 's probably not,
,,,  going to be allowed instead you 're gon na,
,,,  need to take your speaking note with,
,,,  you something like this now you might,
,,,  ask why in the world are speaking note,
a7nz55f9MUY3,0.31,0.41,  speaking note are an abbreviated,Structure
,,,  version of your formal outline that our,
,,,  note card that you take with you to the,
,,,  podium now you might be wondering well,
,,,  why ca n't I just take my outline my,
,,,  formal outline with me well the primary,
a7nz55f9MUY4,0.43,0.53,  reason that you 're not encouraged to do,Structure
,,,  that is a a tendency when we have the,
,,,  full outline in front of u to want to,
,,,  rely on it and we end up sort of reading,
,,,  our outline rather than delivering our,
,,,  speech like a professor once said to me,
a7nz55f9MUY5,0.55,1.08,  he said Jess a speech is not an essay on,Structure
,,,  it hind leg now what he meant is that,
,,,  a speech should not just be an essay,
,,,  read aloud and if we take our outline,
,,,  with u a attempting to kind of read,
,,,  the outline and it end up sounding,
a7nz55f9MUY6,1.09,1.2,  like an essay instead of speech that,No
,,,  sound more spontaneous and natural so to,
,,,  prevent that tendency to read we use,
,,,  speaking note now when you 're putting,
,,,  together your speaking note what you 're,
,,,  going to do is put together a very,
a7nz55f9MUY7,1.22,1.33,  abbreviated version of your formal,Structure
,,,  outline on a few note card instead of,
,,,  using complete sentence you 're gon na,
,,,  use a few key word or phrase so instead,
,,,  of having a formal outline that look,
,,,  like this you 're going to use speaking,
a7nz55f9MUY8,1.35,1.45,  note that are abbreviated and loop and,Structure
,,,  that look like this now there 's an,
,,,  occasion where you may be allowed to,
,,,  write something out completely and,
,,,  that 's when you have a quotation you may,
,,,  be allowed to bring a quotation note,
a7nz55f9MUY9,1.47,1.57,  card with you if your quotation more,Structure
,,,  than a sentence or two your professor,
,,,  will probably allow you to write it out,
,,,  completely and take it with you now you,
,,,  may wonder why in this one case do I get,
,,,  to write it out well when you 're quoting,
a7nz55f9MUY10,1.58,2.07,  someone you need to be exact you do n't,No
,,,  want to make any mistake so you 're,
,,,  allowed to write it out so that you can,
,,,  refer to it if you need it however even,
,,,  though it 's written out completely you,
,,,  do n't want to read the quote you want to,
a7nz55f9MUY11,2.1,2.18,  know it 's so well that you can look at,No
,,,  the audience periodically a yours,
,,,  the quote but you still have it there,
,,,  for reference if you need it why do n't,
,,,  you take a look at these student,
,,,  speaking note do you think they were,
a7nz55f9MUY12,2.2,2.31,  effective unfortunately not most of the,No
,,,  student speech suffered because they,
,,,  did n't follow these important guideline,
,,,  for developing speaking note each of,
,,,  you will most of you will probably,
,,,  relate to what I 'm going to say sorry,
a7nz55f9MUY13,2.37,2.55,  one second oh okay each of you will,Structure
,,,  probably relate to what I 'm going to say,
,,,  today because most of the source that I,
,,,  used in resource I I used came from,
,,,  this campus,
,,,  one of the first guideline for,
a7nz55f9MUY14,2.57,3.06,  developing speaking note ha to do with,No
,,,  the size of the note card typically you,
,,,  want your note card to be about this,
,,,  size which is 4 by 6 inch 3 by 5,
,,,  inch tends to be a little bit small,
,,,  and hard to read and 5 by 7 tends to be,
a7nz55f9MUY15,3.09,3.2,  a little large also you probably want,No
,,,  your note card to either be quiet or,
,,,  some light pastel color if you use,
,,,  bright color or especially if you use a,
,,,  variety of bright color it 's extremely,
,,,  just distracting for the audience and,
a7nz55f9MUY16,3.22,3.33,  you want your note card not to be the,No
,,,  focus of attention so use a pale pastel,
,,,  or white I also typically recommend that,
,,,  you only use a few note card maybe one,
,,,  or two though you may go up to a many,
,,,  a five or six I recommend one or two,
a7nz55f9MUY17,3.36,3.45,  because it make sure that then you do n't,Structure
,,,  just try to cram your formal outline on,
,,,  to your speaking note card and if you,
,,,  have a lot of speaking note card,
,,,  there 's a real temptation just to cram,
,,,  it on there and then you end up reading,
a7nz55f9MUY18,3.47,3.57,  it after all there 's another reason I,No
,,,  recommend only a few note card if you,
,,,  have a lot of note card it 's really,
,,,  easy to get lost if there 's just one or,
,,,  two you ca n't get lost if you have a lot,
,,,  and you start getting nervous you might,
a7nz55f9MUY19,3.58,4.07,  end up getting your note card out of,No
,,,  order and that 's going to make you look,
,,,  disorganized and more nervous than you,
,,,  probably are in addition when you do,
,,,  your note card you want to use large,
,,,  font or you want to write quite large so,
a7nz55f9MUY20,4.1,4.19,  that you could look down easily you want,No
,,,  it to be very legible so you can glance,
,,,  down on your note card for just a,
,,,  second see the key idea and then speak,
,,,  to the audience directly you also want,
,,,  to use very short phrase just a word or,
a7nz55f9MUY21,4.22,4.31,  two you do n't want to write out a,No
,,,  sentence it 's just remember a word or,
,,,  two to trigger your memory,
,,,  not to tell you exactly what you 're,
,,,  supposed to say recognize that you 're,
,,,  speaking note are really just a visual,
a7nz55f9MUY22,4.33,4.43,  framework to remind you of what your,Structure
,,,  outline is and what your speech is it 's,
,,,  just a little hint it 's not the whole,
,,,  thing now occasionally you might be,
,,,  using some sort of electronic,
,,,  presentation program like PowerPoint and,
a7nz55f9MUY23,4.45,4.55,  if you do they have a note page option,No
,,,  that may find really helpful for,
,,,  composing your speaking note now,
,,,  realize that when you get to the podium,
,,,  to give your speech your speaking note,
,,,  are going to be your best friend you 're,
a7nz55f9MUY24,4.57,5.04,  going to want to make sure that they 're,Structure
,,,  in very good shape so you can give a,
,,,  good speech,
,,,  you want to write large you want to be,
,,,  legible use just a freak a few key word,
,,,  and you also want to make sure you,
a7nz55f9MUY26,5.06,5.24,  practice with your note card I 've seen,No
,,,  student practice only with their,
,,,  outline until they get up in front of,
,,,  the class and then they 're not used to,
,,,  the note card that it unnerves them so,
,,,  make sure you practice with your note,
,,,  card so that you 're used to using the,
,,,  note card and handling them and you 're,
,,,  used to just working off a few key,
,,,  phrase otherwise your speech probably,
,,,  wo n't be a good a it can be,
qFLL-XB56UU1,0.05,0.23,  Hello this is Steve Campitelli of Academic Skills .,No
,,,  Today we 're presenting `` Presenting Effectively . '',
,,,  I 've divided this presentation into two ( 2 ) part .,
,,,  The first part deal with the presentation itself and how it 's sequenced .,
,,,  The second part deal with the PowerPoint  the visual ,
,,,  and some tip and some strategy ;,
qFLL-XB56UU2,0.25,0.41,  some idea on how to use that a bit more effectively .,No
,,,  Okay so we 'll make a start .,
,,,  This doctor  she 's a US professor ,
,,,  Susan Weinschenk .,
,,,  She talk about five thing that presenter need to know before they present .,
,,,  I 'm going to go through those five and we 'll just talk about them a we go .,
qFLL-XB56UU3,0.45,1.03,  She talk about dividing information into sequenced chunk .,Structure
,,,  Now in the same way you view an essay ,
,,,  or you view your writing  you divide it into sequenced chunk :,
,,,  An introduction a conclusion section and a body section in the middle .,
,,,  And she talk about dividing,
,,,  a longer talk  perhaps one of an hour where you might have a departmental presentation ,
qFLL-XB56UU4,1.08,1.26,  or a longer conference workshop in to 20 chunk,No
,,,  and she talk about shorter talk  a 20 conference presentation for example perhaps ,
,,,  in 5 chunk .,
,,,  Some great example of how people present and,
,,,  sequence their information really well : TED Talks .,
,,,  If you go to ted.com/talks and have a look .,
qFLL-XB56UU5,1.29,1.47,  Another one if you have n't checked it out,Structure
,,,  it 's fantastic it 's a three minute thesis : 3MT .,
,,,  If you Google or YouTube '3MT ' you can find some great example online,
,,,  and what happens in 3MT is people doing a PhD,
,,,  have compressed their thesis into three minute a an oral presentation .,
,,,  It 's a fantastic example of reduction and sequencing .,
qFLL-XB56UU6,1.5,2.11,  She also talk about being aware of multiple sensory channel .,No
,,,  Now there are three ( 3 ) input channel here if you like .,
,,,  There 's two ( 2 ) visual  one ( 1 ) being you : the presenter ;,
,,,  the second being the visual  most people present with some sort of visual ;,
,,,  and the audio channel being what you 're listening to :,
,,,  me : the presenter  you : the presenter  talking .,
qFLL-XB56UU7,2.14,2.27,  Two ( 2 ) visual ; one ( 1 ) audio .,No
,,,  The message is : Do n't make this too busy .,
,,,  If this ha too much information on it,
,,,  or it 's too busy there 's too much happening ; if you 're speaking to quickly,
,,,  and you 're moving around too much,
,,,  there is input overload . Okay ? Next thing :,
qFLL-XB56UU8,2.32,2.44,  What you say is only part of the message . This is pretty clear .,No
,,,  What she 's talking about here is nonverbal behaviour,
,,,  and the importance of the nonverbal message .,
,,,  We 'll come back to that .,
,,,  Another thing she talk about is a 'Call to Action ' .,
,,,  Now some public speaker require the audience to do something  whether it 's,
qFLL-XB56UU9,2.49,3.07,  giving at a charity event or something like that ...,No
,,,  In an academic situation or a conference situation this might be,
,,,  what do you want them to do or what you want them to know . Okay ?,
,,,  And I prefer to call this the takeaway message or the take home message .,
,,,  When the audience leaf through the door at the end of the session,
,,,  what are they taking away with them ? What have you said ?,
qFLL-XB56UU10,3.11,3.29,  And finally :,No
,,,  people imitate your emotion . So even if you feel like,
,,,  you do n't want to do this and you 're dying inside ... Be positive .,
,,,  You 've got to look positive and the audience,
,,,  according to Susan tends to feed off,
,,,  your positivity or negativity so make it a positive look .,
qFLL-XB56UU11,3.33,3.49,  Okay looking at then the organization : if she 's talking about,Structure
,,,  sequencing or if we 're talking about sequencing and structure,
,,,  and clear structure essentially any presentation ,
,,,  no matter what the length  ha three ( 3 ) part .,
,,,  There 's the introduction : where you tell them what you 're going to tell them ;,
,,,  the body : where you tell them ;,
qFLL-XB56UU12,3.5,4.08,  and the conclusion : where you tell them what you 've just told them .,Structure
,,,  It 's a simple sort of three structure .,
,,,  That introduction is essentially setting the context telling them what you 're going to say ,
,,,  so it could be a part 1 part 2 part 3 ... I 'm going to talk about ...,
,,,  Consider using a hook .,
,,,  Now this doe n't always have to be something funny or a joke . It might be,
qFLL-XB56UU13,4.12,4.35,  a relevant story it could be a visual it could be an interesting fact it might be a question to the audience .,No
,,,  Some sort of hook to engage the audience,
,,,  engage the people you 're talking to .,
,,,  2 : The Body . Remember to split that into section okay ?,
,,,  Think about what you might present to the neutral listener :,
,,,  A reasonably intelligent but uninformed audience .,
qFLL-XB56UU14,4.38,5,  Tell them the story . Okay ? So what is the logical sequence for it ?,Structure
,,,  And the conclusion should make clear,
,,,  the body should a well what the takeaway message is .,
,,,  So I always say treat this like a,
,,,  narrative and tell the story logically .,
,,,  There 're two type of language essentially that you 're using in your writing . It 's the same when,
qFLL-XB56UU15,5.04,5.2,  you 're speaking in this sort of semi situation .,No
,,,  There 's content language : that 's what you 're talking about  the topic ;,
,,,  and there 's functional language which give u ,
,,,  the listener the audience  signal about what you 're saying .,
,,,  It might be thing like sectioning .,
,,,  You know `` First I want to talk about ... '' `` The next thing I want to move on to ... '',
qFLL-XB56UU17,5.24,5.49,  It could be transition : `` Let me move on '' or `` Having said that let me move on to the next point . '',No
,,,  It might be rephrasing or clarifying .,
,,,  `` Let me rephrase that ... '' `` Let me point out that ... '',
,,,  These thing give signal to the audience that something important is about to be said .,
,,,  Emphasis ; summary ; concluding ;,
,,,  moving between section ; giving example ...,
,,,  All of that type of functional language is extremely important .,
wp4ho9raVjA1,0,0.15,  not a long time ago there wa this,Structure
,,,  famous survey which concluded that most,
,,,  people fear public speaking more than,
,,,  they feared death the American comedian,
,,,  Jerry Seinfeld summed up the statistic,
,,,  brilliantly when he said so for the,
wp4ho9raVjA2,0.19,0.33,  average person if you go to a funeral,No
,,,  you 're better off in the casket than,
,,,  doing the eulogy that 's funny right,
,,,  wrong speaking to an audience is,
,,,  something two out of three people will,
,,,  do in their professional career so,
wp4ho9raVjA3,0.36,0.51,  which person are you would you rather be,No
,,,  the one in the casket or the one,
,,,  delivering the eulogy the important,
,,,  thing to remember is that a presentation,
,,,  is a performance a performance it need,
,,,  an artist to WoW the audience so come,
wp4ho9raVjA4,0.55,1.14,  along now pay attention and take your,Structure
,,,  first step to becoming a presentation,
,,,  ninja,
,,,  you,
,,,  like with any project you can divide,
,,,  your presentation into three distinct,
wp4ho9raVjA5,1.17,1.31,  phase the planning phase the,Structure
,,,  performance phase and the reflection,
,,,  phase let 's first look at the planning,
,,,  phase the first step is to know your,
,,,  audience because they 'll be judging your,
,,,  performance learn a much a you can,
wp4ho9raVjA6,1.34,1.52,  about your listener their bias and,Structure
,,,  their expectation address your topic,
,,,  from the audience 's perspective identify,
,,,  the presentation objective the next,
,,,  step is to outline your presentation so,
,,,  that you get a clear overview of it,
wp4ho9raVjA7,1.54,2.11,  content build your story like this tell,Structure
,,,  what you plan to talk about tell your,
,,,  message or story tell again what your,
,,,  presentation wa about this way you,
,,,  deliver your key message three time,
,,,  prepare a flowchart of how you plan to,
wp4ho9raVjA8,2.14,2.32,  run your presentation conceptualize and,No
,,,  then make it happen your idea only hold,
,,,  value when you produce something,
,,,  effective using them so when creating,
,,,  presentation remember to human decode,
,,,  visuals first and text last picture,
wp4ho9raVjA9,2.35,2.52,  really do speak a thousand word use,No
,,,  them an important part of planning is,
,,,  practice preparing well will help you,
,,,  stay calm and lessen the risk of failure,
,,,  practice continuously to ensure you,
,,,  finish within the stipulated time and,
wp4ho9raVjA10,2.54,3.11,  yet deliver an impactful message the,No
,,,  next phase is the performance phase,
,,,  clearly state right at the start where,
,,,  you 're headed with your presentation if,
,,,  you 're nervous show video first it will,
,,,  help you calm down,
wp4ho9raVjA11,3.13,3.28,  make your theme clear and consistent,Structure
,,,  throughout the presentation always place,
,,,  your strongest point first and,
,,,  reiterate them in your summary,
,,,  let 's see a scenario from our virtual,
,,,  office good morning thank you so much,
wp4ho9raVjA12,3.32,3.44,  for coming today I 'm going to make it,No
,,,  really easy for you to track your sale,
,,,  quota using a free and interactive tool,
,,,  the best part is it automatically log,
,,,  all data for you and constantly update,
,,,  why are the cloud let 's learn more about,
wp4ho9raVjA13,3.46,4.01,  this software,Structure
,,,  open and close each section with a clear,
,,,  transition at appropriate interval,
,,,  mention what you have covered and where,
,,,  you are about to go make it easy for,
,,,  your audience to follow your story by,
wp4ho9raVjA14,4.04,4.21,  demonstrating enthusiasm use word like,No
,,,  incredible and awesome wow your audience,
,,,  do n't be afraid of making joke being,
,,,  playful and showing fun visuals making,
,,,  your audience smile is the easiest way,
,,,  to success let 's return to the virtual,
wp4ho9raVjA15,4.24,4.38,  office this brings me to the end of the,No
,,,  first part moving on to the next section,
,,,  and personally one of my favorite,
,,,  simply because it allows me to show off,
,,,  my brilliance well not really now we,
,,,  learn how to use and make most of this,
wp4ho9raVjA16,4.4,4.57,  powerful and awesome tool,Structure
,,,  the final phase is the reflection phase,
,,,  after the presentation ass it,
,,,  overall effectiveness ask yourself did,
,,,  you make the sale did you persuade the,
,,,  audience to adopt your recommendation,
wp4ho9raVjA17,4.59,5.13,  will listener nodding their head in,No
,,,  agreement or sitting with their arm,
,,,  crossed were they interested or seemed,
,,,  bored ask analyze and improve if you 're,
,,,  going to give the presentation again,
,,,  what change can you make to improve it,
wp4ho9raVjA18,5.18,5.35,  in presentation le is always more,Structure
,,,  plan what your key message will be then,
,,,  structure the main part of your,
,,,  presentation around these key theme,
,,,  this can seem very scary but it work,
,,,  wonder try to use the entire platform,
wp4ho9raVjA19,5.39,5.54,  when you speak it will also demand that,No
,,,  you practice more and focus on your,
,,,  audience which is always good,
,,,  human have a very short attention span,
,,,  shortly after you 've started your,
,,,  presentation your audience will begin to,
wp4ho9raVjA21,5.56,6.18,  wonder when you finish so exactly ten,Structure
,,,  minute into your presentation do,
,,,  something different a handy trick to,
,,,  overcome this lack of focus is by,
,,,  changing the scene and showing a video,
,,,  or handing out a sample by doing that,
,,,  you persuade the audience to refocus on,
,,,  you,
taifW0vJmZk1,0.04,0.2,  I 'd like to start off my presentation,Structure
,,,  today by getting and asking for you for,
,,,  audience participation so I 'll ask if,
,,,  you 're capable to please stand and,
,,,  choose a partner we have an odd number,
,,,  so Dave I might have to be my partner in,
taifW0vJmZk2,0.23,0.42,  this one so made you all right so we 're,No
,,,  in pair so to make it easy the person,
,,,  with the last name that 's early a in,
,,,  the alphabet will be numbered 1 okay now,
,,,  the first action item take raise your,
,,,  right hand and put it up against your,
taifW0vJmZk3,0.46,1.07,  partner 's hand and then on the count of,No
,,,  three the person that 's number one is,
,,,  going to push are you ready 123 now,
,,,  what 's interesting about that exercise,
,,,  is there were some commentary that I,
,,,  picked up one person did not push back,
taifW0vJmZk4,1.1,1.27,  took their hand completely out of the,No
,,,  way the other person almost fell down,
,,,  Byron had asked are we supposed to push,
,,,  back now the point of this story again,
,,,  is what happens when we push others in,
,,,  the majority of u pushed back now just,
taifW0vJmZk5,1.32,1.46,  think about that and apply that to your,No
,,,  presentation your public speaking and,
,,,  even go bit deeper think about the time,
,,,  you 've been in an audience where you,
,,,  have pushed back against the presenter,
,,,  on their message now think of why that,
taifW0vJmZk6,1.5,2.11,  happened did they engage right away did,No
,,,  they present their information in term,
,,,  that matter to you well think about that,
,,,  for a moment it 's human behavior when we,
,,,  are pushed we push back so that 's a,
,,,  lesson that we can apply in all of our,
taifW0vJmZk7,2.14,2.26,  communication not only in public,No
,,,  speaking and front,
,,,  audience but within small team at work,
,,,  anytime we need to persuade someone to,
,,,  take action think of this exercise you,
,,,  just went through and again when you,
taifW0vJmZk8,2.3,2.46,  achieve your result by pushing on,Structure
,,,  someone and I 'll be the first to admit I,
,,,  did n't become a master overnight this is,
,,,  an issue that I had to deal with I,
,,,  always came to the presentation,
,,,  thinking I wa the expert and I knew,
taifW0vJmZk9,2.49,3.02,  everything and I would get up in front,No
,,,  of the room and I would tell each and,
,,,  every person I know what you 're doing,
,,,  wrong just listen to me I do you think,
,,,  that went over they tell me to my face,
,,,  but most likely when they left they,
taifW0vJmZk10,3.05,3.18,  blocked out all the information I had,No
,,,  shared during that presentation never to,
,,,  be seen from again and that 's where,
,,,  recently I became in London I dug little,
,,,  self awareness a far a my presentation,
,,,  skill my authenticity a a presenter,
taifW0vJmZk11,3.21,3.36,  and again where it can I be more,No
,,,  effective in my communication and part,
,,,  of it is again persuasion motivation,
,,,  what it my what block am I implementing,
,,,  and putting in front of myself in order,
,,,  to achieve my goal of sharing my message,
taifW0vJmZk12,3.39,4.01,  in order for actually be taken so how,No
,,,  can you apply this in your communication,
,,,  I would challenge you part of it is,
,,,  being conversational a a speaker but,
,,,  how doe that happen well John Maxwell,
,,,  sent me an email today maybe he sent you,
taifW0vJmZk13,4.03,4.23,  an email a well a men at what Maxwell,No
,,,  which ha hundred of thousand of,
,,,  member he say the question he like to,
,,,  ask is why why is it this way why are,
,,,  you acting in in this behavior why did,
,,,  you reach this decision and again that,
taifW0vJmZk14,4.25,4.43,  open u up to sharing more information,No
,,,  a well a helping u see,
,,,  others point of you understand what,
,,,  they are thinking which is very,
,,,  interesting I 'm educating myself I 'm,
,,,  learning to write nonfiction and what 's,
taifW0vJmZk15,4.46,5.02,  interesting is that many author let you,Structure
,,,  know the character let you know them,
,,,  more on a personal basis by letting you,
,,,  know what 's ticking what they 're,
,,,  thinking inside their head this is much,
,,,  different than most of our human,
taifW0vJmZk16,5.03,5.14,  interaction oftentimes you do n't have,No
,,,  the presenter up here telling you what,
,,,  exactly is happening at that moment in,
,,,  time so there 's a bit of a disconnect,
,,,  and that 's the same with audience,
,,,  member the engagement factor so part,
taifW0vJmZk17,5.17,5.33,  of being a better affected presenter and,No
,,,  communicator is developing your speech,
,,,  and content to put into your,
,,,  presentation way to engage the audience,
,,,  a the example I presented today giving,
,,,  your audience to stand up and,
taifW0vJmZk18,5.35,5.49,  participate again creates movement,No
,,,  interaction but again ask you have to,
,,,  provide very detailed instruction or it,
,,,  can go off course they could begin,
,,,  chatting about the news the weather so,
,,,  again this is where depending on your,
taifW0vJmZk19,5.5,6.04,  time if the view very precise in your,No
,,,  messaging and that 's where doe the,
,,,  example that presentation wa done,
,,,  before and that 's where it went off the,
,,,  rail and that 's where I thought about it,
,,,  how what can I bring to the table what,
taifW0vJmZk20,6.06,6.25,  can I do when I share it today to,No
,,,  clarify the stats so if you know how,
,,,  precise I wa what did I ask you to,
,,,  determine who went first last name and,
,,,  that 's where I said whoever came first,
,,,  in the alphabet i made that decision,
taifW0vJmZk21,6.26,6.39,  because oftentimes when you ask an,Structure
,,,  audience and again in any presentation,
,,,  when you ask question of the audience,
,,,  if you 're not very specific and how you,
,,,  want them to answer you 'll confuse them,
,,,  and you 'll lose your,
taifW0vJmZk22,6.41,6.57,  ability to motivate and that 's where if,No
,,,  I ask a rhetorical question and the,
,,,  audience start giving the answer is,
,,,  then I 've lost my messaging so these,
,,,  easy to implement step our area that I,
,,,  would just challenge you to incorporate,
taifW0vJmZk24,6.59,7.17,  a you start developing content for your,Structure
,,,  next presentation because you have the,
,,,  power to be inspirational you have the,
,,,  power to be it more a better,
,,,  communicator in a better,
,,,  conversationalist in front of a room and,
,,,  I look forward to hearing your message,
,,,  and future presentation thank you,
XqOC58-strg1,0,0.11,  in some presentation you have to work,Structure
,,,  pretty hard to get clear on what your,
,,,  main point are we 're going to explore a,
,,,  few different way to do this and,
,,,  emphasize the topical style of,
,,,  organizing your main point so let 's go,
XqOC58-strg2,0.13,0.29,  to the computer and drill down on this,No
,,,  welcome back friend in this video we 're,
,,,  going to talk about how to organize the,
,,,  main point of a presentation we 'll talk,
,,,  about several approach and we 'll drill,
,,,  down a little deeper on the topical,
XqOC58-strg3,0.3,0.41,  approach which is often the most tricky,Structure
,,,  for people we 're assuming here you have,
,,,  an introduction body and conclusion to,
,,,  your presentation and we 're only talking,
,,,  about how to arrange the main point of,
,,,  the presentation we 're not talking about,
XqOC58-strg4,0.43,0.52,  how to fill the bucket in with detail,Structure
,,,  like story an example just the,
,,,  ordering and selection of your main,
,,,  point first let 's talk about,
,,,  chronological this is an approach that,
,,,  you can use where time is your key,
XqOC58-strg5,0.55,1.07,  variable if you 're teaching somebody how,No
,,,  to do something for example you might,
,,,  talk about the three step involved,
,,,  first second third step you often see,
,,,  this for how to type presentation if,
,,,  it 's a before during and after,
XqOC58-strg6,1.09,1.21,  presentation that 's also using time a a,Structure
,,,  key variable but here you might talk,
,,,  about your life before an issue or time,
,,,  and then during which would be maybe the,
,,,  focus the transformational experience or,
,,,  a certain period of your life that wa,
XqOC58-strg7,1.22,1.33,  the center and then after word that 's,No
,,,  another way to use time spatial is,
,,,  another way to arrange main point this,
,,,  is not the most common but I may use it,
,,,  once in a while I 'm talking about my,
,,,  life for example if someone want me to,
XqOC58-strg8,1.35,1.47,  talk about different place I 've lived,Structure
,,,  in my journey I might organize it in,
,,,  term of living in the East then I lived,
,,,  in the West and last the South where,
,,,  we 're using direction or space symptom,
,,,  cause and treatment is another option,
XqOC58-strg9,1.49,1.58,  especially in the medical world if,Structure
,,,  you 're doing a presentation that,
,,,  involves anything medical or healthcare,
,,,  related frequently in your physician,
,,,  and other medical professional talk,
,,,  with these three main point if you 're,
XqOC58-strg10,2,2.1,  doing a persuasive presentation it 's,No
,,,  very likely you 'll be ordering them in a,
,,,  problem benefit main point,
,,,  order I have a whole separate video on,
,,,  this it 's a pretty sophisticated in,
,,,  Psychological approach to organ,
XqOC58-strg11,2.12,2.22,  main point it 's a little more,Structure
,,,  intermediate or advanced but it is a,
,,,  great approach if you want to convince,
,,,  people to your point of view or convince,
,,,  them to take some action I have a whole,
,,,  separate video like I mentioned I 'll put,
XqOC58-strg12,2.24,2.34,  the link to that video in the,Structure
,,,  description below now we get to the,
,,,  topical approach to organizing main,
,,,  point this one often throw people off,
,,,  because there 's no one right way to,
,,,  select the subtopics of your,
XqOC58-strg13,2.37,2.5,  presentation if you have a subject,Structure
,,,  that 's not chronological that 's not,
,,,  problem solution benefit then how do you,
,,,  do it well you have to think about the,
,,,  overall topic and then break it down,
,,,  into it subtopics that 's right I think,
XqOC58-strg14,2.52,3.02,  that 's a more accurate way to describe,Structure
,,,  this subtopics so the idea here is you,
,,,  have a whole you have a subject you 're,
,,,  speaking on and you have a focus a main,
,,,  point a thesis then you have to figure,
,,,  out well what are the natural part of,
XqOC58-strg15,3.04,3.18,  that thesis of that whole and those,Structure
,,,  become your main point your main point,
,,,  will depend upon the unique aspect of,
,,,  the subject itself no two topic or,
,,,  alike and so you 'll have to figure that,
,,,  out a you go there 's a little more art,
XqOC58-strg16,3.2,3.31,  to this than science so for example if,No
,,,  you 're talking about dinosaur one way,
,,,  to do it would be to talk about the land,
,,,  sea and air dinosaur if you 're doing,
,,,  your research and you 're reading about,
,,,  dinosaur that 's one of the main way,
XqOC58-strg17,3.33,3.44,  that your author and researcher will,Structure
,,,  break this up but it 's not the only way,
,,,  you might talk about small medium and,
,,,  large dinosaur and so you have to,
,,,  figure out what your main point is to,
,,,  the whole presentation and then figure,
XqOC58-strg18,3.46,3.58,  out how to break that into it natural,Structure
,,,  part you might be talking about meat,
,,,  for example in a different subject a,
,,,  different presentation and you might,
,,,  discus beef chicken and fish a your,
,,,  main point but a you 're reading and a,
XqOC58-strg19,4,4.09,  you 're researching your focus might,Structure
,,,  change a little bit annually I 'm not,
,,,  really talking about meat a much a I,
,,,  am about protein source for your diet,
,,,  so then you might back out and rearrange,
,,,  these and talk about meat bean and,
XqOC58-strg20,4.11,4.22,  supplement I 've seen people do it this,No
,,,  way because these are different,
,,,  approach to different way to get your,
,,,  protein in your diet may be camping gear,
,,,  is a topic you 're passionate about,
,,,  isotopic I love to talk about a lot of,
XqOC58-strg21,4.24,4.34,  my video because it 's,No
,,,  my main thing I do in the summertime,
,,,  and the nice weather I camp with my,
,,,  family and if I were doing that I would,
,,,  talk about maybe my tent sleeping bag,
,,,  and backpack that 's one of the way to,
XqOC58-strg22,4.36,4.48,  discus the gear these are the subtopics,No
,,,  of camping gear that you commonly hear,
,,,  about when you reading in magazine and,
,,,  researching it so you if you 're in a,
,,,  professional situation this is where it,
,,,  get a little tricky because let 's say,
XqOC58-strg23,4.5,5,  you 're doing an update at a meeting well,Structure
,,,  every audience is there is different,
,,,  people at every meeting you go to and it,
,,,  ha on what level of executive or,
,,,  manager you 're speaking to and well ti,
,,,  their time a year and what the overall,
XqOC58-strg24,5.03,5.12,  focus and agenda is for the meeting but,Structure
,,,  you might for example if you 're doing a,
,,,  normal update on your department you,
,,,  might talk about the different project,
,,,  the budget and the staffing that 's three,
,,,  way three topic to break up your,
XqOC58-strg25,5.15,5.27,  update into so the part have to be from,Structure
,,,  the same hole and that 's a real lesson,
,,,  to take away from this if you have a,
,,,  subject you 've really got to figure out,
,,,  what the natural part are and because,
,,,  when you go off in the wrong direction,
XqOC58-strg26,5.29,5.39,  something 's not going to seem right to,Structure
,,,  listener it wo n't hang together and be,
,,,  logical if you change the pattern you,
,,,  change the variable you 're using to,
,,,  decide on your main point for example,
,,,  if I were talking about camping gear and,
XqOC58-strg27,5.41,5.53,  I talked about tent and sleeping bag,No
,,,  and I threw in this weird extra point,
,,,  about saving money that 's going to be,
,,,  awkward that 's going to be odd and it 's,
,,,  breaking the pattern in the topical,
,,,  order here and changing subtopics in a,
XqOC58-strg28,5.56,6.04,  way that 's going to stand out a little,Structure
,,,  bit it 's not going to have that not,
,,,  natural logical flow you might also be,
,,,  talking about dinosaur or come back to,
,,,  this example small medium and then you,
,,,  throw in there oh and also we 'll talk,
XqOC58-strg30,6.06,6.31,  about dinosaur that fly that 's again,Structure
,,,  going to break your pattern so you have,
,,,  to figure out what your hole is and then,
,,,  break that into it natural part and,
,,,  that 's really the key aspect of the,
,,,  topical main point approach you want to,
,,,  figure out how to break the hole into,
,,,  it part so I hope this video ha been,
,,,  helpful and I encourage you to use it in,
,,,  your next presentation so god bless and,
,,,  I will see you next time,
bWfN-nczoJI1,0.04,0.14,  hey there welcome back to project,Structure
,,,  management made easy today we 're going,
,,,  to be talking about how you can,
,,,  structure your presentation so let 's,
,,,  get to it,
,,,  now that we 've had a chance to talk,
bWfN-nczoJI2,0.16,0.29,  about visuals and body language we can,Structure
,,,  now get into the presentation itself,
,,,  where do you start regardless of,
,,,  different presentation goal there 's one,
,,,  thing everyone love a good story I 'm,
,,,  going to show you how you can structure,
bWfN-nczoJI3,0.31,0.43,  your presentation like a story so that,Structure
,,,  you keep your audience engaged your,
,,,  memorable they leave feeling a if,
,,,  they 've learned something and you 've,
,,,  changed their perspective and maybe they,
,,,  may even be motivated to take action at,
bWfN-nczoJI4,0.45,0.57,  the end first we want to start with what,Structure
,,,  is whether you 're doing a sale pitch or,
,,,  an annual investor meeting the status,
,,,  quo is what you want to point out first,
,,,  and foremost this is important because,
,,,  your audience is trusting you to fill,
bWfN-nczoJI5,0.59,1.13,  them in on what is what is the current,No
,,,  state of affair where do we stand it 's,
,,,  your responsibility a a presenter to,
,,,  build the tension and allow a they say,
,,,  the plot to thicken after you 've,
,,,  established what is and why the meeting,
bWfN-nczoJI6,1.15,1.26,  is happening it 's time to show them a,Structure
,,,  better way this is an opportunity to,
,,,  discus alternative new idea and,
,,,  option to solve what is look at what is,
,,,  and what could be for each point you are,
,,,  trying to make this help keep their,
bWfN-nczoJI7,1.28,1.4,  attention just like a story that will be,Structure
,,,  lost in both hope and despair,
,,,  simultaneously that 's a good thing let 's,
,,,  take a general quarterly marketing,
,,,  meeting for example it would sound,
,,,  something like this,
bWfN-nczoJI8,1.41,1.55,  we missed our cue three lead number by,Structure
,,,  12 % this could impact our,
,,,  end bonus if we do n't,
,,,  finish strong in q4 but our we have a,
,,,  new content strategy team that will be,
,,,  working to bring the leader they are,
bWfN-nczoJI9,1.58,2.11,  top performer in the industry and have,No
,,,  the potential to help u supersede our,
,,,  goal but the team requires new tool in,
,,,  order to be effective at their job in,
,,,  that case we 'll be implementing,
,,,  for them this is called the persuasive,
bWfN-nczoJI10,2.14,2.25,  story structure it pull you back and,Structure
,,,  forth keep you on the edge hoping that,
,,,  there are solution to all these,
,,,  problem,
,,,  it 's what the best storyteller do and,
,,,  what the best speaker do some really,
bWfN-nczoJI11,2.28,2.42,  good example of using this method is,No
,,,  when Steve Jobs gave the convocation,
,,,  address at Stanford University or when,
,,,  JK Rowling spoke at Harvard you should,
,,,  really check out those speech finally,
,,,  you want to make the ending effective by,
bWfN-nczoJI13,2.44,3,  involving a call to action so that your,Structure
,,,  team is inspired and ready to make,
,,,  thing happen if you 're looking for more,
,,,  tip check out HBO 's guide to persuasive,
,,,  presentation so that 's it for how you,
,,,  can structure your presentation next,
,,,  week we 're going to be getting into some,
,,,  agile project management see you then,
RVPW9MWPO3Y1,0,0.12,  if you 're taking this course one of the,Structure
,,,  question that might have drawn you into,
,,,  the course is the question of why do,
,,,  McKenzie and Bain & BCG presentation,
,,,  feel or look so different than,
,,,  everything else so I want to unveil this,
RVPW9MWPO3Y2,0.15,0.28,  some of the secret here with the three,Structure
,,,  core quote unquote secret I 'll teach,
,,,  you here and the whole goal is to avoid,
,,,  presentation like this if you 've ever,
,,,  been in a presentation where somebody 's,
,,,  presenting a slide like this you know,
RVPW9MWPO3Y3,0.3,0.47,  how painful it is to be in the audience,Structure
,,,  let 's avoid that so what make McKinsey,
,,,  presentation different I would argue,
,,,  it 's something I 'm calling flow which is,
,,,  that the presentation is easy to digest,
,,,  even though it ha complex information,
RVPW9MWPO3Y4,0.49,1.08,  and is presented in a way that is very,Structure
,,,  easy to consume so how doe flow play,
,,,  out it 's three thing one is vertical,
,,,  flow this is the core idea that the,
,,,  title is the cell what you want to use,
,,,  the title in PowerPoint to really tell,
RVPW9MWPO3Y5,1.12,1.28,  the audience what the takeaway of the,No
,,,  information is and what they should do,
,,,  next second is the horizontal flow the,
,,,  deck from slide to slide ha a story and,
,,,  is part of a larger narrative and make,
,,,  sense and third is the overall flow and,
RVPW9MWPO3Y6,1.32,1.48,  this really come together through,Structure
,,,  mastering the pyramid principle and mici,
,,,  concept which we have been hammering,
,,,  over and over again in this course,
,,,  finally one thing that really set apart,
,,,  presentation especially from my,
RVPW9MWPO3Y7,1.5,2.03,  experience have been McKinsey and BCG,No
,,,  wa the amount of feedback that people,
,,,  get often you 're getting a ton of,
,,,  feedback from peer one slide doe n't,
,,,  just get created and sent to a client,
,,,  it 's often looked at hundred of time,
RVPW9MWPO3Y8,2.06,2.19,  and colleague are giving people note,Structure
,,,  saying maybe you could put the title,
,,,  this way maybe you could synthesize it,
,,,  more effectively so a good lesson here,
,,,  is to make sure you 're finding someone,
,,,  in your team that you trust and can,
RVPW9MWPO3Y9,2.21,2.37,  challenge you to help make your content,Structure
,,,  better vertical flow is perhaps the most,
,,,  important concept when building out a,
,,,  PowerPoint presentation it 's the concept,
,,,  that the title match the content there,
,,,  need to be an alignment between what,
RVPW9MWPO3Y10,2.39,2.52,  you 're actually showing in the slide and,Structure
,,,  the title which tell the audience what,
,,,  to think or synthesizes the information,
,,,  on the slide often people put together,
,,,  slide with lot of information and then,
,,,  add a title that 's just description that,
RVPW9MWPO3Y11,2.55,3.08,  say something like quarter three data,Structure
,,,  right and then you 're looking at all,
,,,  this information it 's just information,
,,,  you do n't actually know what the key,
,,,  takeaway or the insight is so this is,
,,,  one of my favorite example because it 's,
RVPW9MWPO3Y12,3.11,3.29,  done where the content ha no word but,No
,,,  the takeaway is there 's more than one,
,,,  way to create a square and we show and,
,,,  prove this visually another thing to,
,,,  remember here is a lot of company and,
,,,  just people in general are moving to a,
RVPW9MWPO3Y13,3.31,3.44,  sixteen by nine layout so vertical logic,No
,,,  I do n't want to confuse you here can,
,,,  also apply horizontally the key is just,
,,,  what are people going to read first,
,,,  right,
,,,  same thing here there 's more than one,
RVPW9MWPO3Y14,3.46,4.02,  way to create a square and then you,No
,,,  prove it in the core of the slide again,
,,,  put the takeaway where people look first,
,,,  here 's another example I love very,
,,,  simple visual not a lot of content one,
,,,  out of four people are green right and,
RVPW9MWPO3Y15,4.04,4.19,  then you have the content that back,Structure
,,,  this up and show it horizontal flow is,
,,,  the second concept and it build on the,
,,,  first one so once you have the title,
,,,  matching the content you want to make,
,,,  sure that your individual slide when,
RVPW9MWPO3Y16,4.22,4.35,  combined actually tell a story going,Structure
,,,  from slide one to slide two,
,,,  side three and so on doe it actually,
,,,  make sense there 's a couple technique,
,,,  for doing that but the core idea is do,
,,,  the title tell the story if they do n't,
RVPW9MWPO3Y17,4.38,4.54,  you still have work to do,No
,,,  so an easy way to check this you just go,
,,,  through your slide one by one in this,
,,,  you can do this in the slide sorter view,
,,,  or just flip through or even just,
,,,  printing it and look at the title flip,
RVPW9MWPO3Y18,4.57,5.11,  through doe it tell a story another way,No
,,,  you can do this is in PowerPoint just go,
,,,  to the outline view in the top left and,
,,,  you can just highlight copy and paste,
,,,  the title to word and then you can,
,,,  start editing it a you 're writing it,
RVPW9MWPO3Y19,5.14,5.27,  you can also use this to turn it into an,Structure
,,,  executive summary but the point is just,
,,,  get the title in a different format so,
,,,  they 're easy to read and say do these,
,,,  even make sense so what doe a good,
,,,  slide look like let 's go through the,
RVPW9MWPO3Y20,5.29,5.45,  element that make up a slide guy it is,Structure
,,,  solid now this slide is all fake data,
,,,  but put together to show a couple of key,
,,,  principle so let 's look at it in more,
,,,  depth first the title provides a clear,
,,,  takeaway it 's a the company is growing,
RVPW9MWPO3Y21,5.48,6.03,  consistently driven by three key action,Structure
,,,  now that also summarizes all the,
,,,  information in the slide a key thing to,
,,,  avoid is not having excess information,
,,,  in the slide and you can confirm this by,
,,,  saying doe the title cover everything,
RVPW9MWPO3Y22,6.05,6.18,  if not perhaps there 's content in the,No
,,,  slide that you do n't actually need also,
,,,  in this slide the subtitle offer clear,
,,,  takeaway instead of just saying revenue,
,,,  and labeling it like many chart are,
,,,  labeled say revenue quadrupled in four,
RVPW9MWPO3Y23,6.2,6.34,  year it give the audience a frame of,No
,,,  reference for the degree of change also,
,,,  we have another subtitle three key,
,,,  action drove revenue growth that frame,
,,,  up the three key reason below,
,,,  also we use bolding and spacing to,
RVPW9MWPO3Y25,6.37,7.06,  really pull out what are the three key,Structure
,,,  element geographic expansion building,
,,,  out the sale team and acquiring a,
,,,  competitor again let 's look at the slide,
,,,  with the shape and the argument is up,
,,,  top there 's more than one way to create,
,,,  a square that 's what you want to,
,,,  persuade the audience of and then you,
,,,  have the proof in the content and you,
,,,  want to use this core idea for every,
,,,  slide you create,
4prTn3SnLyI1,0.01,0.11,  hello welcome to robin 's daily english,No
,,,  we know good presentation skill are the,
,,,  most important skill,
,,,  because if you have effective,
,,,  presentation skill,
,,,  this mean you are good at communicating,
4prTn3SnLyI2,0.15,0.26,  however one of the key fact of an,Structure
,,,  effective presentation is it,
,,,  structure a good structure help you,
,,,  remain,
,,,  calm stay on topic and avoid any awkward,
,,,  silence,
4prTn3SnLyI3,0.28,0.4,  during the presentation a typical,Structure
,,,  presentation structure cover,
,,,  all the vital section and is a good,
,,,  starting point for yours,
,,,  it allows your audience to easily follow,
,,,  you during the presentation,
4prTn3SnLyI4,0.43,0.57,  now let 's see the different part of our,No
,,,  typical presentation,
,,,  part one greeting before you start,
,,,  delivering your talk,
,,,  greet the audience for instance,
,,,  you can greet like this good morning,
4prTn3SnLyI5,1,1.16,  dear lady and gentleman,No
,,,  or good morning dear colleague,
,,,  the selection of greeting depends on the,
,,,  time of your presentation,
,,,  a well a on the type of your audience,
,,,  based on the time of the presentation,
4prTn3SnLyI6,1.19,1.3,  you may,No
,,,  say good morning good afternoon or good,
,,,  evening,
,,,  so check with the time of the,
,,,  presentation beforehand,
,,,  also check about the target audience 's,
4prTn3SnLyI7,1.34,1.5,  gender beforehand we usually say,No
,,,  dear lady and gentleman,
,,,  but no female audience might be present,
,,,  during the presentation,
,,,  if you greet dear lady and gentleman,
,,,  but there is no lady,
4prTn3SnLyI8,1.52,2.08,  it will create an awkward situation for,Structure
,,,  you,
,,,  part two introduce yourself,
,,,  in this part you should introduce   yourself,
,,,  your introduction should include your,
4prTn3SnLyI9,2.1,2.22,  name,No
,,,  and job position a well a the name of,
,,,  the organization,
,,,  that you are associated with,
,,,  for example if your name is tony,
,,,  morrison,
4prTn3SnLyI10,2.23,2.37,  and you are working a the marketing,No
,,,  manager of,
,,,  global id company you can say,
,,,  my name is mark tony morrison i 'm the,
,,,  marketing manager of global i.t company,
,,,  on the other hand if you are a student,
4prTn3SnLyI11,2.4,2.58,  and doing the bsc software engineering,No
,,,  at x university your name is,
,,,  let 's say jenny anderson,
,,,  you can tell i 'm jenny edison,
,,,  a student of the bsc software,
,,,  engineering,
4prTn3SnLyI12,2.58,3.13,  at x university,Structure
,,,  part 3 introduce your topic,
,,,  in this section tell your audience what,
,,,  you are going to talk about in a,
,,,  conscious,
,,,  organized matter and tell them,
4prTn3SnLyI13,3.16,3.29,  why the topic you are going to present,No
,,,  is,
,,,  relevant your audience need to know,
,,,  that what you are presenting is,
,,,  important,
,,,  so tell them a few important,
4prTn3SnLyI14,3.33,3.46,  point about the topic that you will,Structure
,,,  discus elaborately later,
,,,  for instance your topic is,
,,,  ultra first accounting software and you,
,,,  would like to,
,,,  introduce this to your audience,
4prTn3SnLyI15,3.5,4.02,  you can say today i,No
,,,  will talk about ultra first accounting,
,,,  software,
,,,  that is first data entry capability,
,,,  and,
,,,  improved accounting security,
4prTn3SnLyI16,4.06,4.19,  ultrafirst accounting software ha,No
,,,  already,
,,,  gained the trust of the corporate sector,
,,,  here based on my experience i would like,
,,,  to draw your attention,
,,,  to an important issue that is,
4prTn3SnLyI17,4.22,4.39,  question session in this section,Structure
,,,  you should share your policy on question,
,,,  session usually during any presentation,
,,,  if audience asks question,

df2XcxcdE1A1,0,0.14,  hello i am Ram Gopal from presentation,No
,,,  process calm in this edition of,
,,,  PowerPoint diagram tutorial series you,
,,,  will learn how to create brick wall,
,,,  texture in PowerPoint the brick wall,
,,,  texture you will learn to create look,
df2XcxcdE1A2,0.16,0.32,  like this is n't this beautiful once you,No
,,,  create the 2d version you can also,
,,,  create the 3d version by applying 3d,
,,,  effect to the texture that we have,
,,,  created let u see how to create the,
,,,  brick wall texture from scratch by going,
df2XcxcdE1A3,0.34,0.51,  to a new slide the first step is to go,No
,,,  to auto ship menu and under rectangle,
,,,  pick up this basic rectangle shape and,
,,,  draw the size of a brick so this this is,
,,,  the brick that you are going to,
,,,  replicate now select that one and while,
df2XcxcdE1A4,0.54,1.11,  holding the ctrl button move the,No
,,,  rectangle to the desired position you,
,,,  can have it a close to the previous one,
,,,  a you want now select both of them and,
,,,  while holding ctrl make one more copy,
,,,  and hold them there and if you want one,
df2XcxcdE1A5,1.15,1.3,  more brick here you can hold ctrl and,No
,,,  move it here so now we have got the,
,,,  first level of brick ready the first,
,,,  the bottom level ready now select all of,
,,,  them press ctrl G to group them and now,
,,,  this whole group can be replicated so,
df2XcxcdE1A6,1.33,1.5,  you are going to press ctrl tab and make,No
,,,  a copy here now when you make,
,,,  another copy of the same what it doe n't,
,,,  look like a brick wall so all you need,
,,,  to do is to move this slightly off so,
,,,  that you 're able to see a proper brick,
df2XcxcdE1A7,1.53,2.12,  wall arrangement now once you do that,No
,,,  once again the next step is to ungroup,
,,,  them group and group now align this,
,,,  brick with the bottom one so there we,
,,,  are we are able to do that and here,
,,,  again do the same thing for this one now,
df2XcxcdE1A8,2.16,2.29,  this look more like the brick wall,No
,,,  arrangement now that we have done this,
,,,  ctrl G so that you can group them and,
,,,  all you need to do is to keep,
,,,  duplicating this till the time you get,
,,,  the height your desire maybe I can,
df2XcxcdE1A9,2.34,2.55,  select all of them once again and have,No
,,,  them arranged on top and there we are,
,,,  the structure is ready now ungroup all,
,,,  of them now we have individual brick,
,,,  available now the time is it is now time,
,,,  to add some gradient to these shape now,
df2XcxcdE1A10,3,3.13,  select all of them now go to shape fill,No
,,,  and the color I 'm going to use is this,
,,,  one called a red accent to darker,
,,,  twenty percent now this look,
,,,  fairly plain I do n't want it that way so,
,,,  i am going to give some gradient color,
df2XcxcdE1A11,3.15,3.27,  so once again let me go to shape fill,No
,,,  and this time go to gradient and the,
,,,  gradient i 'm going to choose is this one,
,,,  called a linear right now this look,
,,,  more like a brick wall texture and the,
,,,  shape outline can be something greyish,
df2XcxcdE1A12,3.3,3.44,  like this one which you want to have,No
,,,  slightly thicker,
,,,  outline you can do that and there it is,
,,,  so there we have the 2d version of the,
,,,  brick wall texture let me show you how,
,,,  to apply the 3d to the same one so let,
df2XcxcdE1A13,3.48,4.04,  me select all of that and press ctrl G,No
,,,  to group it right click go to format,
,,,  shape and let me go to effect option,
,,,  and under 3d rotation let me choose the,
,,,  preset called a perspective contrasting,
,,,  left which is under perspective so click,
df2XcxcdE1A14,4.06,4.21,  on that one and you can see a 3d,No
,,,  perspective applied to the wall now the,
,,,  wall is slightly tilted in the direction,
,,,  that you do n't want so let me go to c 0,
,,,  tation and let me call it zero degree,
,,,  and there the wall is straight now we,
df2XcxcdE1A15,4.24,4.4,  need to apply depth so that we are able,No
,,,  to mimic a proper wall here so let me go,
,,,  to 3d format and the depth I am going to,
,,,  add is say 30 if you are not happy with,
,,,  the thickness of the brick you can,
,,,  always add 50 and the shape outline can,
df2XcxcdE1A16,4.44,5,  actually be either removed to get this,No
,,,  effect or you can go to depth and add,
,,,  this color for the depth so that is how,
,,,  it is done now to get a little more of,
,,,  bevel effect all you need to do is to go,
,,,  back once again to 3d format and you can,
df2XcxcdE1A17,5.03,5.21,  apply this the front level and also the,No
,,,  bevel for the bottom and this is this is,
,,,  the the brick 3d brick texture now you,
,,,  can apply,
,,,  shadow and the perspective shadow this,
,,,  is called a perspective diagonal upper,
df2XcxcdE1A18,5.23,5.42,  right and there it is our 3d wall is,No
,,,  complete a 3d wall is a very beautiful,
,,,  metaphor for obstacle and you can use it,
,,,  quite a lot in concept based business,
,,,  light let me show you some application,
,,,  of brick wall taken from our PowerPoint,
df2XcxcdE1A19,5.45,6.01,  CEO pack this is the first example here,No
,,,  we talk about overcoming obstacle to be,
,,,  number one and here you have number one,
,,,  behind the wall and we are able to reach,
,,,  beyond the wall by using a ladder so you,
,,,  can write your text here let me give you,
df2XcxcdE1A20,6.03,6.16,  another example here here it show,No
,,,  crossing the barrier to reach your goal,
,,,  and you can talk about the barrier here,
,,,  let me show you another example and this,
,,,  one is about a bridge where we talk,
,,,  about the current situation and the,
df2XcxcdE1A21,6.18,6.32,  desired situation and the various stage,No
,,,  of moving to the desired situation so,
,,,  these are some of the various way in,
,,,  which you can use brick wall texture in,
,,,  PowerPoint if you are a busy business,
,,,  presenter who doe n't have the time to,
df2XcxcdE1A22,6.34,6.45,  create such professional looking,No
,,,  graphic for yourself you can always,
,,,  take a look at our off,
,,,  solution like PowerPoint CEO pack,
,,,  volume 1 and 2 the 2 CEO pack have more,
,,,  than 1600 fully irritable chart and,
df2XcxcdE1A23,6.48,6.59,  graphic for CEOs and busy business,No
,,,  presenter like you just choose the,
,,,  template that match your thought and,
,,,  template that match your thought and,
,,,  replace the sample text with your own,
,,,  text and your business let 's get ready,
,,,  in no time creating professional quality,
df2XcxcdE1A25,7.02,7.25,  business slide ha never been easier,No
,,,  hope you like the tutorial on creating,
,,,  big brick wall texture in PowerPoint if,
,,,  you want to learn more such tutorial,
,,,  video and if you want to read some,

7sLXTR9AxKg1,0.02,0.16,  the PGR 9 is the name given at aut to,Structure
,,,  the process by which doctoral student,
,,,  formally propose their research project,
,,,  within the first 12 month of their,
,,,  candidature this process is also called,
,,,  the confirmation of candidature because,
7sLXTR9AxKg2,0.18,0.31,  when successfully completed the doctoral,Structure
,,,  student status move from provisional to,
,,,  confirmed to complete the PG online,
,,,  process each doctoral student must,
,,,  submit a written research proposal of up,
,,,  to 10000 word and give an oral,
7sLXTR9AxKg3,0.34,0.48,  presentation in this video we 'll talk,No
,,,  about the oral presentation component of,
,,,  the PG online you can expect to have,
,,,  about 40 to 60 minute for your PG,
,,,  online presentation including time for,
,,,  question and answer you can use visual,
7sLXTR9AxKg4,0.51,1.02,  aid in your presentation and you 'll,Structure
,,,  have an audience usually consisting of,
,,,  your PG online reviewer your,
,,,  supervisor colleague from your school,
,,,  and faculty and pep,
,,,  interested outsider bear in mind though,
7sLXTR9AxKg5,1.05,1.17,  that each faculty in school handle PG,No
,,,  online presentation differently so the,
,,,  parameter of your presentation may vary,
,,,  slightly from others when you begin to,
,,,  draft your PG online presentation,
,,,  remember that your reviewer will have,
7sLXTR9AxKg6,1.19,1.32,  all the detail in your written research,Structure
,,,  proposal instead of giving a close view,
,,,  of all the detail focus on the big,
,,,  picture the heading in the written PG,
,,,  online proposal can guide the structure,
,,,  of your presentation of these heading,
7sLXTR9AxKg7,1.35,1.47,  though some will be of greater interest,Structure
,,,  to a general audience,
,,,  make sure you prioritize content about,
,,,  your research question research,
,,,  rationale and significance relevant,
,,,  literature research design and progress,
7sLXTR9AxKg8,1.51,2.07,  to date you may also like to discus,No
,,,  your own positioning a the researcher,
,,,  if this is relevant to your project the,

,,,  be sure that your visual aid are n't too,
7sLXTR9AxKg9,2.09,2.21,  busy aim for simple slide with,No

7sLXTR9AxKg10,2.24,2.37,  using color that remain visible even,No

,,,  attention away from you a the presenter,
,,,  when question time arrives bear in mind,
7sLXTR9AxKg11,2.4,2.51,  that it 's okay if you do n't have all the,Structure
,,,  answer at this early stage in your,
,,,  research the most important thing is to,
,,,  show that you are open to idea and that,
,,,  you are thinking deeply about your,
,,,  project and it design for more on the,
7sLXTR9AxKg12,2.55,3.08,  PGR line you can come to our 2pg online,No

Ujw_21AuU5k1,0,0.13,   Everybody love a good story,Structure
,,,  and story are a great way to open a presentation .,
,,,  That attention is a key moment,
,,,  in every presentation .,
,,,  A lot of people tell me though I 'm just not,
,,,  a good storyteller .,
Ujw_21AuU5k2,0.14,0.27,  Well I 'm going to show you a very simple recipe,No
,,,  that 'll help you improve .,
,,,  Hello I 'm Alex Lyon and this is Communication Coach .,
,,,  We 're here to help you increase your impact,
,,,  to lead your team to higher level of excellence,
Ujw_21AuU5k3,0.31,0.43,  and presentation are a really important part,Structure
,,,  of your leadership and the attention,
,,,  that first part of the open of your presentation,
,,,  is critical to gain your audience 's interest,
,,,  and story are a great way to do that,
,,,  so let 's unpack this a little bit .,
Ujw_21AuU5k4,0.45,0.57,  First your story have to be concise .,Structure
,,,  That mean about 60 second maybe even 30 second,
,,,  for a shorter presentation .,
,,,  You do n't want to get long,
,,,  the first thing out of your mouth in a presentation .,
,,,  So keep it tight and that may take,
Ujw_21AuU5k5,0.58,1.1,  a few repetition through the story,Structure
,,,  a you 're practicing to pare it down to the bare essential .,
,,,  To next tip is to make sure you follow,
,,,  the classic story format .,
,,,  There 's like a little template that you can follow,
,,,  to make sure you 're telling what sound like a story .,
Ujw_21AuU5k6,1.13,1.25,  Every story ha for example a beginning middle and ending .,Structure
,,,  The beginning is really simple .,
,,,  You can do it in about once sentence,
,,,  and that 's where you establish the time,
,,,  the people and the place or setting .,
,,,  So it sound a little bit like this .,
Ujw_21AuU5k7,1.27,1.38,  Several year ago my brother wa hanging out,No
,,,  in the garage with his young son,
,,,  working on their motorcycle .,
,,,  So that just told you the time several year ago,
,,,  the people my brother and his son,
,,,  and the context or the place the garage .,
Ujw_21AuU5k8,1.41,1.52,  Next you move to the body of the presentation,Structure
,,,  and that 's where all the action take place .,
,,,  That 's where you build up to a climactic event .,
,,,  Here 's an example .,
,,,  They were hanging out in the garage,
,,,  working on their motorcycle handing tool,
Ujw_21AuU5k9,1.54,2.07,  back and forth and at one moment his young son,No
,,,  turned to my brother and said dad am I small for seven ?,
,,,  My brother turned to him and said,
,,,  buddy why would you say that ?,
,,,  He said because the kid at school,
,,,  were calling me a shrimp .,
Ujw_21AuU5k10,2.1,2.18,  By the time you get to that line,Structure
,,,  the kid at school are calling me a shrimp,
,,,  you have reached the climactic moment of that story,
,,,  the high emotional point .,
,,,  The whole reason you 're telling the story,
,,,  is to get to that moment so you have to figure out,
Ujw_21AuU5k11,2.2,2.32,  what your climactic event is in the story,Structure
,,,  and get there within a couple of move .,
,,,  The next part is the ending or the resolution .,
,,,  This is where you have to bring everything to a close,
,,,  'cause you left them on the cliff there,
,,,  with the climactic event .,
Ujw_21AuU5k12,2.34,2.47,  It sound a little bit like this for this story .,No
,,,  My brother leaned in and looked him in the eye and said,
,,,  buddy you are just perfect for seven .,
,,,  The doctor said so himself at our last visit,
,,,  and I know that you 're gon na continue to grow,
,,,  into a strong and healthy young man .,
Ujw_21AuU5k13,2.51,3.02,  Period .,Structure
,,,  That 's the resolution the ending to the story .,
,,,  Beginning middle and end and if we squashed it,
,,,  all together the story would be,
,,,  between 30 and 60 second .,
,,,  Now there 's a hidden fourth point in every story .,
Ujw_21AuU5k14,3.04,3.15,  It 's the moral to the story the lesson learned .,Structure
,,,  The whole reason you 're telling the story,
,,,  is to drive to the heart,
,,,  of the message of your presentation .,
,,,  That 's why we tell a story to draw their interest,
,,,  into the heart of the message .,
Ujw_21AuU5k15,3.16,3.25,  You do n't want to tell some unrelated story,Structure
,,,  just 'cause it 's funny or it 's a nice story .,
,,,  It ha to go to the central idea,
,,,  that you 're gon na express in the presentation .,
,,,  You can express this moral directly,
,,,  or it can come out in the flow of the introduction .,
Ujw_21AuU5k16,3.28,3.36,  That 's up to you .,Structure
,,,  I personally like to come at the moral to the story,
,,,  in a little bit of a subtle way .,
,,,  I do n't like to state it directly .,
,,,  It sound a little bit like I 'm trying to teach them,
,,,  the lesson learned too soon .,
Ujw_21AuU5k17,3.38,3.49,  It 'll come out in the rest of the presentation .,No
,,,  One of the great technique when you 're sharing,
,,,  an attention though is leave a little bit,
,,,  for example the resolution of the story,
,,,  for the ending of the presentation your closing,
,,,  your clencher the very last thing you do .,
Ujw_21AuU5k18,3.51,4.02,  This is very satisfying .,Structure
,,,  I talk about this in another video,
,,,  called How To Open and Close a Presentation,
,,,  and it 's where you tell most of the story here,
,,,  and then you tell your whole presentation,
,,,  and then you remind u of what you 're saying earlier,
Ujw_21AuU5k19,4.04,4.14,  and finish it off .,Structure
,,,  So I 'll give you an example here,
,,,  where I tell most of it and then I break it,
,,,  right after the climactic event .,
,,,  Many year ago I wa hanging out on campus,
,,,  and I saw this beautiful woman standing there .,
Ujw_21AuU5k20,4.18,4.29,  Over the next few week I tried to get to know her,No
,,,  and made some small talk and finally got up the gut,
,,,  to ask her out .,
,,,  She looked me straight in the eye,
,,,  and with a huge smile said no thanks I 'm not interested .,
,,,  And then she zipped her mouth .,
Ujw_21AuU5k21,4.33,4.45,  I wa devastated .,No
,,,  See that 's the climactic event there .,
,,,  She 's rejected me and then that 's all .,
,,,  She gave me no wiggle room whatsoever .,
,,,  So let 's say now I 'm telling a story,
,,,  I 'm telling a presentation about perseverance,
Ujw_21AuU5k22,4.48,5,  or relationship or rejection or taking risk,Structure
,,,  whatever the topic is for that particular presentation .,
,,,  I tell my whole introduction all the body point,
,,,  I say in conclusion and I wrap thing up,
,,,  and there 's this one final moment,
,,,  called the closing or the clencher .,
Ujw_21AuU5k23,5.02,5.11,  And I can bring the story back around,Structure
,,,  reminding people that I shared it earlier,
,,,  and then give them the resolution .,
,,,  It 's a very satisfying prize .,
,,,  They love it .,
,,,  So it sounded a little bit like this .,
Ujw_21AuU5k24,5.13,5.28,  Well even though I wa rejected,No
,,,  by that beautiful woman in the student union,
,,,  many year ago she finally did go on a date with me,
,,,  and 15 year later I am still proud to call her my wife .,
,,,  That by the way is a true story,
,,,  and I love it because it ha this natural element,
Ujw_21AuU5k25,5.32,5.4,  where you feel like you 've got most of the story,Structure
,,,  but then there 's a little bit more to it .,
,,,  So if you have a story like that but you can break,
,,,  in a nice spot and bring it back around,
,,,  it 's very satisfying .,
,,,  As you can tell the story should come,
Ujw_21AuU5k26,5.43,5.52,  from some relatively predictable source .,Structure
,,,  Your own life .,
,,,  The people in the life around you with permission .,
,,,  You do n't want to just tell story,
,,,  without asking permission .,
,,,  You may read biography and thing like that,
Ujw_21AuU5k27,5.54,6.02,  and gain story from that .,Structure
,,,  One of the thing I recommend against however,
,,,  is taking story from other speaker,
,,,  that they 're already telling or other author,
,,,  that they 're already telling .,
,,,  You want your story to be fresh and original .,
Ujw_21AuU5k28,6.04,6.16,  It 's gon na be way more impactful .,Structure
,,,  So question of the day what are your tip,
,,,  for telling great story ?,
,,,  I would love to hear your comment in that section below .,
,,,  So thanks God bless and I hope you tell,
,,,  a great story in your next presentation .,

,,,  if you a the mc want to captivate your audience with the introduction,
,,,  start here minimize the use of the speaker 's basic bio point,
,,,  the audience can find that information on a website or event program,

dXWRPWcxvGU10,3.24,3.41,  event 's theme to the audience 's need how do you find,Structure
,,,  the right story well reach out to the speaker or,

,,,  introduction that delivers a fun narrative now,
,,,  directly connecting with the speaker ensures two thing one you 're telling a,

,,,  example of an introduction that wa used during a,
,,,  previous tedx vancouver showcase the theme of the showcase identity and i,
,,,  reached out to all of the speaker and asked them,
,,,  one question what make you feel relevant,
dXWRPWcxvGU12,4.08,4.26,  then i asked them to tell me the story of the conversation when they realized,No
,,,  their true identity now this wa a fun example for,
,,,  all of the speaker but one in particular wa speaker scott jones who,
,,,  is a friend from the tv industry and his intro went like this,
,,,  our next speaker is a tv host and digital medium thought leader whose,
,,,  mission is to be a distinguished voice for geek,
dXWRPWcxvGU13,4.3,4.5,  and gamers around the world when return of the jedi,No

,,,  a host efficiently build that speaker up and then,
,,,  let the speaker hit the ground running you want to try and land,
,,,  your intro time around 30 to 45 second so you can create anticipation,
,,,  and leave the audience wanting more remember brevity,
,,,  is your audience 's best friend finally end,
dXWRPWcxvGU16,5.4,6,  with their full name a soon a the audience hears the speaker 's full name,No
,,,  it 's almost instinctual they will begin their welcoming applause,
,,,  this is a common trap in introduction where host say the speaker 's full name,
,,,  and they still have about three or four more line to read make the,
,,,  speaker 's full name the last thing you read in the,
,,,  introduction it 's a easy a working through the personalized intro and then,

KVbRQ0cE0Ok1,0.03,0.21,  you have to also use a visual aid do n't,No
,,,  panic I 'm here to help but first thing,
,,,  first what is a visual aid a visual aid,
,,,  is a clarifying device that help your,
,,,  audience to understand your speech your,
,,,  visual aid should be a supplement to,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok2,0.25,0.4,  what you are saying it should enhance,No
,,,  and help your audience to understand,
,,,  your message a visual aid could be a,
,,,  PowerPoint presentation a video clip a,
,,,  handout an artifact or even some sort of,
,,,  prop that you bring to class for most,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok3,0.43,0.57,  public speaking class you will be,No
,,,  required to bring a photo or some sort,
,,,  of digital presentation these visual,
,,,  aid will be used in conjunction with,
,,,  your speech in order to better inform,
,,,  persuade or entertain your audience here,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok4,1.01,1.16,  are five basic point for using visual,No
,,,  aid one plan or write your speech,
,,,  before finding your visual aid your,
,,,  speech should not be centered on your,
,,,  visual aid you should have a cohesive,
,,,  effective speech that ha been enhanced,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok5,1.19,1.36,  by the use of your visual aid to make,No
,,,  sure that your visual aid are assisting,
,,,  and accomplishing the purpose of your,
,,,  speech they should help to clarify,
,,,  provide information or to persuade make,
,,,  sure that your visual aid,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok6,1.37,1.53,  are helping with your presentation not,No
,,,  distracting from what you are saying 3,
,,,  make sure your visual aid are visible,
,,,  to the entire audience your visual aid,
,,,  should be big enough and also should be,
,,,  clear enough for everyone in the,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok7,1.56,2.13,  audience to be able to see,No

KVbRQ0cE0Ok8,2.15,2.27,  to keep in mind is not to stand in front,No
,,,  of your visual aid if you 're standing in,
,,,  front of the visual aid you 're blocking,
,,,  someone from being able to see what you,
,,,  are presenting also do n't show your,
,,,  visual aid for the entirety of your,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok9,2.29,2.42,  speech pick out certain point during,No
,,,  your speech that would make sense to,
,,,  have your visual aid being displayed and,
,,,  only show your visual aid during that,
,,,  specific part and then put it away one,
,,,  way you can do this is by putting a,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok10,2.44,2.58,  blank slide in between your photo in,No
,,,  your digital presentation so if you have,
,,,  a photo that 's displaying what you 're,
,,,  talking about you can refer to it and,
,,,  then click it to the next slide and have,
,,,  it be a blank slide so it 's not,
KVbRQ0cE0Ok11,3,3.15,  distracting step 5,No
,,,  have a back plan thing happen all,
,,,  the time especially on important day,
,,,  like when you need to be giving a speech,

WHH8Gx0u9Is1,0.17,0.29,  welcome to my youtube channel PowerPoint,No
,,,  University in this tutorial I am going,
,,,  to show you a process flow diagram in,
,,,  PowerPoint which you can do it in le,
,,,  than five minute you can see here I,
,,,  have just created the symbol for the,
WHH8Gx0u9Is2,0.31,0.42,  start then the decision and then after,Structure
,,,  ated process three process process 1,
,,,  process to a process 3 and based on the,
,,,  process the action will be taken and the,
,,,  end so let 's see how to create this,
,,,  process flow diagram in PowerPoint in,
WHH8Gx0u9Is3,0.45,1.03,  le than 5 minute add a new slide and,No
,,,  change the background to gradient fill,
,,,  go to view enables the guide go to,
,,,  insert shape select an oval shape just,
,,,  click it will create one all shape here,
,,,  and shape fill use some nice color and,
WHH8Gx0u9Is4,1.07,1.26,  shape outline make it white color and,No
,,,  increase the weight to this one and,
,,,  press control D to duplicate I am going,
,,,  to add another symbol for the decision,
,,,  and to change the symbol go to format,
,,,  edit shape change shape and for the,
WHH8Gx0u9Is5,1.3,1.44,  decision the symbol is this one you can,No
,,,  see under flowchart this is the,
,,,  flowchart decision I 'll just click that,
,,,  one increase the size a little bit more,
,,,  and then press control D I am going to,
,,,  create three process here and the,
WHH8Gx0u9Is6,1.47,2.05,  symbol for the process is this one you,No
,,,  can go to edit shape you can see here,
,,,  this is a alternate process or you can,
,,,  use any of this click that one increase,
,,,  the size and reduce the width press,
,,,  control D so this is the second one and,
WHH8Gx0u9Is7,2.09,2.27,  ctrl D is a third one and make sure that,No
,,,  this is aligned properly and it 's,
,,,  vertical also properly and once this is,
,,,  done I 'm going to press control D for,
,,,  this to duplicate and here I am going to,
,,,  add another,
WHH8Gx0u9Is8,2.28,2.42,  cymbal which is if you want you can just,No
,,,  see here you have got a variety of and,
,,,  for example say this one a flowchart our,
,,,  data here I 'll just click so it change,
,,,  to this one and the last one is the end,
,,,  I 'm just going to select this this is,
WHH8Gx0u9Is9,2.45,2.58,  start and this is the end and put it,Structure
,,,  here so you can see here our basic,
,,,  design is ready then I 'm going to add,
,,,  the arrow to add the arrow go to,
,,,  insert shape and select any arrow here,
,,,  the line and just draw a straight line,
WHH8Gx0u9Is10,3.01,3.17,  here straight arrow you can see here and,No
,,,  I 'm just going to view or remove the,
,,,  guide and right mouse click go to,
,,,  format shape and you can change the,
,,,  color for example I 'm going to use,
,,,  orange color and increase the width you,
WHH8Gx0u9Is11,3.21,3.37,  can see here the arrow and then I 'm,No
,,,  going to end arrow type I need something,
,,,  like this and end arrow size which is a,
,,,  bigger one so we got this one and then,
,,,  I 'm going to add the arrow from the,
,,,  decision to the three process for that,
WHH8Gx0u9Is12,3.4,3.58,  select arrow press control D and bring,No
,,,  the arrow here and one more arrow here,
,,,  but here I need a different arrow here,
,,,  for that right mouse click you can,
,,,  change the connector type to connector,
,,,  elbow and you 'll get this particular,
WHH8Gx0u9Is13,4.01,4.24,  arrow and then I 'm just going to ctrl D,No
,,,  to duplicate it put it here and put it,
,,,  here one more and then I 'm just going to,
,,,  copy this ctrl D and put it here and,
,,,  then I 'm going to add the same arrow,
,,,  ctrl D one hand will be this side which,
WHH8Gx0u9Is14,4.29,4.49,  is going to the data part and again,No
,,,  control D one end is here the other and,
,,,  I 'm just dragging it here and again one,
,,,  more arrow control,
,,,  d reduce the size and put it here and,
,,,  control D one more arrow which is going,
WHH8Gx0u9Is15,4.53,5.18,  from this to this so you can see here,No
,,,  our design is over we have to just add,
,,,  the text now to add the text go to,
,,,  insert text box and type it here start,
,,,  make it white century gothic make it,
,,,  bold and reduce the size to 14 Center,
WHH8Gx0u9Is16,5.21,5.35,  align and put it here,No
,,,  and similarly you can add the text to,
,,,  all other symbol so you can see here I,
,,,  have added the text decision process 1,
,,,  process to process 3 and then the action,
,,,  and the end so this is the simplest way,
WHH8Gx0u9Is17,5.38,6.01,  you can create the process flow diagram,No
,,,  that 's it from me friend thank you for,

,,,  building infographics,
,,,  to display your information if you 've,
,,,  been listening and following suit,
k4dEKe6OMWw3,0.26,0.39,  well excellent but now i want to make,No
,,,  sure you 're taking advantage of the,
,,,  tool that vizmi provides and,
,,,  few others do that is animation within,
,,,  your infographic hello world i 'm mike,
,,,  plogger and i 'm here with vizme to help,
k4dEKe6OMWw4,0.4,0.48,  you,No

,,,  creative thinking,
,,,  just you and visme together a one,
,,,  shall we,
k4dEKe6OMWw6,1.05,1.13,  first thing first and that 's just,Structure
,,,  getting started often that 's the most,
,,,  difficult part for,
,,,  all of u taking that first step can be,
,,,  scary but,
,,,  rest assured that visby 's platform is,
k4dEKe6OMWw7,1.15,1.26,  built to make your life,No
,,,  easier once you 've found a fitting,
,,,  template from visumi 's vast selection,
,,,  and adjusted the text,
,,,  to fit your purpose click on graphic,
,,,  in the far,
k4dEKe6OMWw8,1.26,1.41,  left toolbar and scroll down slightly to,No
,,,  animated graphic,
,,,  the first option you 'll see is,
,,,  illustration once you click on that,
,,,  10 different category of more than 300,
,,,  animated illustration will appear,
k4dEKe6OMWw9,1.44,1.55,  everything from finance to sport to,Structure
,,,  real estate or science vismy 's thought,
,,,  of it all,
,,,  consider your purpose let 's say for this,
,,,  example your infographic is all about,
,,,  going green and helping the environment,
k4dEKe6OMWw10,1.57,2.07,  we click on that category and find three,No
,,,  more,
,,,  with each category you 'll have three,
,,,  option flat,
,,,  outline or isometric flat is a it,
,,,  sound,
k4dEKe6OMWw11,2.08,2.17,  the 2d animation appear a if they 've,No
,,,  been placed on a page from a straight on,
,,,  view you 'll find a lot of the same,
,,,  design in outline,
,,,  but they wo n't be filled in with color,
,,,  you can actually choose one of the,
k4dEKe6OMWw12,2.19,2.28,  outline,No
,,,  and edit the color a you see fit,
,,,  either with a pre palette,
,,,  or with your very own creation and the,
,,,  last category is,
,,,  isometric these appear to pop off the,
k4dEKe6OMWw13,2.3,2.42,  page in a 3d type of way,No
,,,  it 's a if the viewer is looking down on,
,,,  the graphic from an angle,
,,,  rather than from straight on,
,,,  another way to use animation in your,
,,,  infographics is through character,
k4dEKe6OMWw14,2.45,2.54,  whether it 's people mascot or even,No
,,,  robot,
,,,  these animation can really bring an,
,,,  infographic to life,
,,,  visme ha over 50 character you can use,
,,,  in an infographic or really any design,
k4dEKe6OMWw15,2.57,3.05,  right now let 's say you work in,Structure
,,,  healthcare go to the professional tab,
,,,  scroll down and you 'll find a doctor,
,,,  when you first put him in the,
,,,  infographic,
,,,  he 'll kindly wave back to you a if he 's,
k4dEKe6OMWw16,3.07,3.15,  thanking you for bringing him,No
,,,  to life but if you do n't like that way,
,,,  for your purpose,
,,,  there 's a variety of other pose that,
,,,  you can choose from,
,,,  maybe you want him pointing to text or,
k4dEKe6OMWw17,3.18,3.26,  coming up with a good idea,Structure
,,,  or maybe even giving two thumb up a if,
,,,  he 's telling,
,,,  a patient that you 're good to go you can,
,,,  even adjust,
,,,  how many time he or she repeat in,
k4dEKe6OMWw18,3.28,3.42,  action and how quickly they do so,No
,,,  your wish is their command,
,,,  if you 're looking for a way to draw,
,,,  attention to a piece of text or a chart,
,,,  gesture might be just what you 're,
,,,  looking for you can have gesture with,
k4dEKe6OMWw19,3.44,3.53,  or without object or,No
,,,  gesture that encourage interaction the,
,,,  first two category are,
,,,  great for pointing a viewer 's eye,
,,,  towards a vital,
,,,  piece of the graphic if there 's,
k4dEKe6OMWw20,3.55,4.04,  something that your audience must see,No
,,,  use these interaction can be used for a,
,,,  wide range of purpose,
,,,  hand can shake they can give high five,
,,,  give thumb up or thumb down,
,,,  or you can even make a heart with two,
k4dEKe6OMWw21,4.06,4.16,  hand coming,No
,,,  together keep in mind all of the same,
,,,  setting that we 've talked about with,
,,,  other animation apply here a well any,
,,,  illustration,
,,,  character or gesture color can be,
k4dEKe6OMWw22,4.18,4.32,  changed within,No
,,,  the dashboard to fit your need do n't,
,,,  let the default color scare you away,
,,,  from the animation design itself,

k4dEKe6OMWw23,4.34,4.42,  much you love them in your infographics,No
,,,  mail opening in firework and symbol oh,

k4dEKe6OMWw24,4.44,4.53,  mind just type it in the search bar to,No
,,,  save you some time this is a good time,
,,,  to point out the animate tab in the,
,,,  upper right portion,
,,,  of the page if you have n't explored,
,,,  already this tab allows you to,
k4dEKe6OMWw25,4.55,5.03,  manipulate the,No
,,,  movement of your animation you can,
,,,  adjust how they enter and exit your,
,,,  design,
,,,  whether it 's a fade or spin into sight,

,,,  up to you,
,,,  have some fun with it and see what you,
,,,  like best however,
,,,  i will say it 's important to note that,
,,,  you do n't want to overwhelm your viewer,
k4dEKe6OMWw27,5.14,5.26,  with,No
,,,  too many animation type stick to one or,
,,,  two throughout your infographic to keep,
,,,  it clutter free,

,,,  visme 's dashboard a well,
,,,  you can create custom chart table map,
,,,  and diagram however you 'd like in the,
k4dEKe6OMWw30,5.56,6.06,  far left sidebar go to data and click,No

,,,  presentation,
k4dEKe6OMWw34,6.42,6.56,  do n't go crazy remember keep it clean,No

Q4SCn6J4ako1,0,0.28,  today we 're going to talk about how you,No
,,,  can most effectively build visual note,
,,,  into a presentation that you 're giving,
,,,  let 's sketch it out welcome to purple to,
,,,  visual video I am your host Doug Neil,
,,,  and this question of how to build in,
Q4SCn6J4ako2,0.32,1.04,  more visuals into a talk that you 're,Structure
,,,  giving is one of the question that I,
,,,  most frequently get asked so let 's jump,
,,,  right into it first up I think it 's,
,,,  important to start with the takeaway in,
,,,  mind and then build your presentation,
Q4SCn6J4ako3,1.06,1.19,  around that takeaway by clearly defining,Structure
,,,  what you want folk to get out of any,
,,,  particular presentation that you 're,
,,,  giving you make it that much easier to,
,,,  build your presentation in a way that,
,,,  achieves that outcome,
Q4SCn6J4ako4,1.24,1.44,  I have a particular goal in mind for you,Structure
,,,  with this presentation so we 're gon na,
,,,  return to this first point here at the,
,,,  end of the video to see if I have done a,
,,,  good enough job of building up to the,
,,,  takeaway another tip that I have found,
Q4SCn6J4ako5,1.46,2,  to be useful is to introduce a single,Structure
,,,  idea at a time even if you 're building,
,,,  up to a larger picture by introducing a,
,,,  single idea at a time and building up,
,,,  that big picture you make it that much,
,,,  easier for the audience to follow along,
Q4SCn6J4ako6,2.08,2.2,  if in contrast you started by throwing,Structure
,,,  up this big complicated diagram then you,
,,,  would likely overwhelm at your audience,
,,,  they 'd be looking all over the place and,
,,,  probably would stop listening to what,
,,,  you 're saying but when you slowly build,
Q4SCn6J4ako7,2.23,2.39,  up that picture one idea at a time your,No
,,,  audience wo n't get lost,
,,,  tip number three use a few word on the,
,,,  screen a possible everyone is tired of,
,,,  text slide so a you explore the,
,,,  balance between visuals and word a you,
Q4SCn6J4ako8,2.42,2.59,  put together your presentation see if,Structure
,,,  you can use a few word a possible and,
,,,  rely more on the visuals to convey the,
,,,  information,
,,,  do n't forget that you have your voice to,
,,,  share idea and the power of having a,
Q4SCn6J4ako9,3.02,3.16,  visual on the screen is that an engaging,No
,,,  visual that 's connected to what you 're,
,,,  saying make it easier to remember the,
,,,  whole package the combination of those,
,,,  thing moving forward so the next time,
,,,  you have a presentation to give and you,
Q4SCn6J4ako10,3.18,3.3,  want to add a visual component to your,No
,,,  presentation keep these three idea in,
,,,  mind,
,,,  start with the takeaway then build,
,,,  around of that introduce one idea at a,
,,,  time and use a few word on the screen,
Q4SCn6J4ako11,3.33,3.46,  a possible let 's return now to that,Structure
,,,  first point to see how well I have,
,,,  reached the takeaway that I have been,
,,,  shooting for in this presentation my,
,,,  goal is to give you enough idea about,
,,,  how to build some visual note into your,
Q4SCn6J4ako12,3.49,4.02,  presentation so that you feel confident,No
,,,  to get started doing it but not so many,
,,,  idea that you feel overwhelmed so if,
,,,  you now feel that you have even a little,
,,,  bit more confidence in building visual,
,,,  note into your next presentation then I,
Q4SCn6J4ako13,4.05,4.21,  consider this presentation a success,Structure
,,,  thank you so much for watching good luck,
,,,  with the next presentation that you put,
,,,  together and I 'll see you next time,
,,,  I hope you enjoyed at that video I would,
,,,  love to hear what you think of these,
Q4SCn6J4ako14,4.23,4.38,  idea so please do what leave a comment,No
,,,  below or connect with me on Twitter at,
,,,  Douglas P Neil on Instagram on Facebook,
,,,  we 're verbal  visual and on snapchat,
,,,  which is becoming kind of a fun platform,
,,,  I 've only been on it for a little bit,
Q4SCn6J4ako16,4.4,5.07,  but I 'm enjoying the dynamic of sharing,No
,,,  bit and piece of my day so if you 're,
,,,  not on snapchat check it out and come,
,,,  say hello and if you would like to dig,
,,,  deeper into the development of your,
,,,  visual note skill then be sure,
,,,  to check out the online course and the,
,,,  ongoing community that we have got going,
,,,  at herbal to visual classroom calm until,
,,,  next time,
17aIhDQ1k8s1,0.1,0.2,  hi,Structure
,,,  i 'm wendy from rural storytelling,
,,,  project today,
,,,  i 'll be going over how we can use,
,,,  presentation a an aid to storytelling,
,,,  and different key technical component,
17aIhDQ1k8s2,0.22,0.33,  of presentation,Structure
,,,  to help do that for today we 're going to,
,,,  go through some objective,
,,,  the first one which would be learning,
,,,  how to be an active listener and to give,
,,,  feedback to our own peer,
17aIhDQ1k8s3,0.35,0.44,  we 're going to also learn about how we,No
,,,  use presentation a an aid to tell our,
,,,  own story,
,,,  and lastly we 'll go over some key,
,,,  technical presentation,
,,,  skill on how we can effectively tell,
17aIhDQ1k8s4,0.47,0.57,  our own story,No
,,,  there are some thing that you should,
,,,  keep in mind of when you 're listening to,
,,,  someone give a speech,
,,,  you want to be an active listener and,
,,,  that mean,
17aIhDQ1k8s5,0.58,1.08,  asking question if you have any and,No
,,,  jotting down,
,,,  what do you like about this speaker 's,
,,,  story,
,,,  speech what do you think can be improved,
,,,  and what reaction do you have after,
17aIhDQ1k8s6,1.1,1.2,  listening,No
,,,  to the speaker 's story speech once you,
,,,  are keeping those in mind a you 're,
,,,  listening,
,,,  you can provide those comment and,
,,,  feedback after,
17aIhDQ1k8s7,1.23,1.32,  now that we know how to actively listen,No
,,,  and get see,
,,,  back when we 're listening to someone,
,,,  give a speech,
,,,  we 're going to learn how we can use,
,,,  presentation,
17aIhDQ1k8s8,1.33,1.47,  a a way to aid storytelling,No
,,,  when we use presentation we can provide,
,,,  visuals,
,,,  and text to help guide u,
,,,  through your speech and your story,
,,,  because of those it becomes really,
17aIhDQ1k8s9,1.5,2,  helpful,No
,,,  to have that to keep your audience,
,,,  engaged what you 're,
,,,  talking about and also help you,
,,,  to guide you through your storytelling,
,,,  when you have some slide to look over,
17aIhDQ1k8s10,2.02,2.13,  to serve a your note,No
,,,  and to also let the audience see,
,,,  what you 're really talking about which,
,,,  is why,
,,,  presentation are really helpful when it,
,,,  come to storytelling,
17aIhDQ1k8s11,2.15,2.24,  now that we know that we 're going to go,No
,,,  into,
,,,  learning how we can do those but the,
,,,  technical,
,,,  presentation skill,
,,,  first off there are animation which,
17aIhDQ1k8s12,2.27,2.4,  help keep the audience focused,No
,,,  enhance their visual impact,
,,,  just like that that is one one animation,
,,,  just to keep the audience focused on,
,,,  this next,
,,,  on this next technical aspect that i am,
17aIhDQ1k8s13,2.43,2.54,  showing you,Structure
,,,  transition which is a period of,
,,,  changing from one slide to another,
,,,  it 's really helpful to help to divide,
,,,  your topic into smaller piece when you,
,,,  incorporate transition,
17aIhDQ1k8s14,2.58,3.1,  visuals help guide the audience on what,No
,,,  the speaker is talking about,
,,,  they also keep the presentation,
,,,  interesting because there 's,
,,,  there are image to help the audience,
,,,  see what the speaker is trying to,
17aIhDQ1k8s15,3.13,3.25,  illustrate,No
,,,  in his or her presentation the note,
,,,  help to guide the speaker during the,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  three platform that i highly recommend,
,,,  is google slide,
17aIhDQ1k8s16,3.26,3.38,  powerpoint and prezi glue slice is,No
,,,  helpful to use,
,,,  when you 're using it online and you want,
,,,  to collaborate with others,
,,,  to work on a presentation together,
,,,  microsoft powerpoint is good with,
17aIhDQ1k8s17,3.4,3.54,  offline use when you do n't have wi,No
,,,  and it ha a lot of it ha a lot more,
,,,  animation feature that you can use,
,,,  and prezi is really good with really,
,,,  long presentation,
,,,  and just like what i 'm using right now,
17aIhDQ1k8s18,3.56,4.11,  which is prezi it can get a little,No
,,,  complicated,
,,,  and the only only setback is that,
,,,  in the free version the version,
,,,  the powerpoint that you save is open to,
,,,  the public,
17aIhDQ1k8s19,4.12,4.23,  so you do n't have private access,No
,,,  when you 're using presentation keep in,
,,,  mind that you do n't have to use a lot of,
,,,  text,
,,,  just a long a you have visuals and,
,,,  some thing,
17aIhDQ1k8s21,4.24,4.4,  to help the audience to be gain the same,Structure
,,,  momentum,
,,,  and be in the same pace with you,
,,,  and follow along to your story,
,,,  that 's all for today i hope this is,
,,,  helpful and learning more about how we,
,,,  can incorporate story,
,,,  into our presentation,
d5jhyhZ9pZ01,0.09,0.22,  hi everyone it 's so nice to see you,No
,,,  again and thank you for sticking with u,
,,,  and clicking on this video I 'm teacher,
,,,  of mine and in this public speaking,
,,,  series you are going to learn how to be,
,,,  an amazing public speaker where 's my my,
d5jhyhZ9pZ02,0.28,0.57,  visual aid but Oh tell me carry can,No
,,,  see now oh we 're not going to be talking,
,,,  about that visual aid we 're going to be,
,,,  talking about visual aid that you can,
,,,  use in your presentation,
,,,  according to research with visual aid,
d5jhyhZ9pZ03,1,1.17,  you can say something without even,No
,,,  seeing you know so today in this video I,
,,,  am going to tell you about visual aid,
,,,  you can use in your speech firstly,
,,,  know what a visual aid is now visual,
,,,  aid are thing or object that you use,
d5jhyhZ9pZ04,1.21,1.37,  in your presentation to even even your,No
,,,  clothes or a visual age for example a,
,,,  man who is wearing a suit and tie is,
,,,  trying to tell the audience that he is,
,,,  mature and professional picture and,
,,,  video are also a visual aid even thing,
d5jhyhZ9pZ05,1.4,1.55,  or object that you hold in your hand,No
,,,  which are known a prop are also a,
,,,  visual aid and all of these help your,
,,,  audience understand your speech better,
,,,  second is know when and how to use a,
,,,  visual aim you should use visual aid,
d5jhyhZ9pZ06,1.58,2.14,  when you want to make something very,No
,,,  clear for example I can show you my,
,,,  favorite food or my favorite animal but,
,,,  do n't use too many image or too many,
,,,  prop or else just keep the focus away,
,,,  from your presentation here are some,
d5jhyhZ9pZ07,2.18,2.32,  extra tip for you first wear clothes,No
,,,  that are suitable for your presentation,
,,,  for example if you 're going to talk,
,,,  about something very serious wear a suit,
,,,  or something that look professional,
,,,  next if you do n't have a computer or,
d5jhyhZ9pZ08,2.35,2.48,  projector you can use prop item that,No
,,,  you can hold in your,
,,,  during the presentation but this usually,
,,,  work better when you 're going to talk,
,,,  explicitly about this prop like for,
,,,  example your favorite pen or your,
d5jhyhZ9pZ09,2.51,3.09,  favorite book or even your favorite toy,No
,,,  now let 's try an activity to practice,
,,,  using visual aid in our presentation,
,,,  first find a pen or a pencil then think,
,,,  of three thing that are useful or,
,,,  thing that you like about that pen or,
d5jhyhZ9pZ011,3.12,4.2,  pencil after that present that to your,No
,,,  class using pen or pencil let me give,
,,,  you an example this is a very useful pen,
,,,  it 's blue in color and it us blue ink,
,,,  I use this pen to write amazing speech,
,,,  for my public speaking class,
,,,  visual aid are tough to use but do n't,
,,,  worry with enough practice you 'll be a,
,,,  master of them in no time so that 's all,
,,,  for today and I 'll see you guy in the,
,,,  next public speaking video bye,
F977vuuxAGA1,0,0.11,  hello and congratulation on getting,No
,,,  access to this video course,
,,,  on how to create engaging presentation,
,,,  so this video course is all about prezi,
,,,  which is,
,,,  the software platform that enables you,
F977vuuxAGA2,0.13,0.22,  to create,No
,,,  engaging presentation now why did we,
,,,  choose this over powerpoint well,
,,,  i 'll talk about that in just a minute a,
,,,  you know,
,,,  creating engaging video and,
F977vuuxAGA3,0.24,0.34,  presentation,No
,,,  is very much important in this day and,
,,,  age,
,,,  especially when many different social,
,,,  medium platform or,
,,,  other platform look for high engagement,
F977vuuxAGA4,0.38,0.49,  right in order to sell something you,No
,,,  need to have an engaging,
,,,  presentation at least to gain people 's,
,,,  trust,
,,,  and get them to interact with you now,
,,,  powerpoint ha come a long way a well,
F977vuuxAGA5,0.52,1.04,  a,Structure
,,,  prezi but when you see prezi next which,
,,,  is the latest version of,
,,,  prezi you will be wowed,
,,,  so with that said let me jump right into,
,,,  this introduction so,
F977vuuxAGA6,1.06,1.15,  what i want to do is give you a quick,Structure
,,,  overview of what 's inside,
,,,  this video course this is the,
,,,  introduction,
,,,  video number two is prezi made easy,
,,,  and i 'll talk about the difference,
F977vuuxAGA7,1.17,1.3,  between prezi next and prezi,No
,,,  classic which is the older version of,
,,,  prezi and how they are different,
,,,  and then we 'll talk about how to start,
,,,  your own prezi presentation in video,
,,,  number three,
F977vuuxAGA8,1.31,1.43,  video number four is the prezi site,Structure
,,,  overview,
,,,  and we 'll talk about how to dive in,
,,,  how to get started and all of that video,
,,,  number five will talk about how to start,
,,,  a,
F977vuuxAGA9,1.44,1.55,  new prezi and we 'll show you a demo,No
,,,  and everything like that and video,
,,,  number six we 'll talk about editing and,
,,,  customization,
,,,  how do you make it fit your need,
,,,  essentially,
F977vuuxAGA10,1.56,2.07,  and video number seven will talk about,No
,,,  shortcut key so,
,,,  a you begin to learn prezi having,
,,,  access to the shortcut key,
,,,  definitely can help speed up the whole,
,,,  process,
F977vuuxAGA11,2.08,2.19,  video number eight we 'll talk about,No
,,,  adding voiceovers,
,,,  and background sound so for those of you,
,,,  who want to take,
,,,  prezi and essentially turn it into a,
,,,  video,
F977vuuxAGA12,2.2,2.29,  this video will be for you so we 're,No
,,,  obviously going to be using a different,
,,,  software to do that,
,,,  but that said i 'm going to show you how,
,,,  to do that and of course last but not,
,,,  least,
F977vuuxAGA13,2.29,2.43,  video number nine we 're going to show,No
,,,  you how to collaborate,
,,,  via prezi so how do you collaborate via,
,,,  your team either in the sense of,
,,,  putting it all together or maybe,
,,,  collaboration,
F977vuuxAGA14,2.44,2.53,  in term of learning so we 'll show you,No
,,,  more in just a second so,
,,,  first thing first why prezi versus,
,,,  powerpoint,
,,,  you know obviously i could made this,
,,,  video course about powerpoint,
F977vuuxAGA15,2.55,3.08,  and powerpoint ha come a long way and,No
,,,  they have evolved over the year but the,
,,,  reason why we chose prezi over,
,,,  powerpoint is simply because prezi,
,,,  really allows you to,
,,,  really engage with your viewer,
F977vuuxAGA16,3.11,3.23,  and you 'll see in just a minute how,No
,,,  engaging it really is,
,,,  now you 'll notice in just a minute with,
,,,  prezi next they kind of have moved,
,,,  more towards the powerful function of,
,,,  powerpoint,
F977vuuxAGA17,3.24,3.35,  so essentially what they 've done is,No
,,,  they 've taken the most powerful feature,
,,,  of powerpoint,
,,,  and taken the most powerful feature of,
,,,  prezi and combined them together,
,,,  to make an amazing tool,
F977vuuxAGA18,3.38,3.5,  alright so with that said let 's jump,No
,,,  into,
,,,  video number two,
,,,  hello and welcome back this is video,
,,,  number two,
,,,  and we 're going to dive right in and i 'm,
F977vuuxAGA19,3.52,4.02,  going to talk about prezi,No
,,,  next which is the latest version of,
,,,  prezi,
,,,  versus prezi classic so,
,,,  a of now of making this video course,
,,,  you can either,
F977vuuxAGA20,4.04,4.14,  make your prezi classic video or prezi,No
,,,  next,
,,,  now keep in mind that if you make any,
,,,  prezi presentation,
,,,  in prezi classic you can not really,
,,,  import them into prezi next and you 'll,
F977vuuxAGA21,4.18,4.29,  get an,No
,,,  idea of what the major difference are,
,,,  that way you can,
,,,  decide on which one to go now prezi next,
,,,  new feature so prezi next is like i said,
,,,  the latest version,
F977vuuxAGA22,4.31,4.45,  of prezi and the main difference,No
,,,  one of the main difference is that,
,,,  prezi next,
,,,  run on html5 so a you will notice,
,,,  a good amount of presentation,
,,,  video player they 're all moving towards,
F977vuuxAGA23,4.48,5.01,  html5,No
,,,  that 's essentially the future while on,
,,,  the other hand,
,,,  classic prezi run on adobe flash so,
,,,  a you know certain browser a of now,
,,,  they have,
F977vuuxAGA24,5.01,5.15,  literally gotten rid of playing,No
,,,  adobe flash because many people,
,,,  consider it to be unsafe and prone to,
,,,  performance issue so that 's the big big,
,,,  thing,
,,,  and other than that frame for example,
F977vuuxAGA25,5.18,5.28,  which will make more sense when i dive,No
,,,  in,
,,,  are hidden until you 're ready to show,
,,,  them you can use,
,,,  fade in or fade out animation which,
,,,  allow you to,
F977vuuxAGA26,5.28,5.4,  manually hide content until you 're,No
,,,  actually ready to show them,
,,,  so the nice thing about prezi is a lot,
,,,  of item,
,,,  you can not see until you zoom in so kind,
,,,  of how you saw,
F977vuuxAGA27,5.42,5.51,  how i zoomed in so you saw the nine,No
,,,  different,
,,,  video topic and then i wa able to zoom,
,,,  in,
,,,  so that 's the nice thing about prezi,
,,,  compared to powerpoint is with,
F977vuuxAGA28,5.52,6.01,  powerpoint,No
,,,  you ca n't really do that but with prezi,
,,,  you can and you can do so much more,
,,,  which i 'll show you in just a minute and,
,,,  also with prezi next you can click,
,,,  and zoom on any frame during the,
F977vuuxAGA29,6.04,6.15,  presentation,No
,,,  and you are not stuck on just like,
,,,  following the slide path sequence,
,,,  number so,
,,,  with the previous classic prezi you can,
,,,  only go in order you have to go like,
F977vuuxAGA30,6.17,6.25,  in order of creating it but with prezi,No
,,,  next which i 'll show you in just a,
,,,  minute,
,,,  for example with the nine video i could,
,,,  either go in order,
,,,  or i could just pick and choose the,
F977vuuxAGA31,6.28,6.37,  bubble right,No
,,,  so that 's the main difference is you 're,
,,,  not stuck,
,,,  on having to follow step one step two,
,,,  step three step four,
,,,  and what that allows you to do is it,
F977vuuxAGA32,6.39,6.48,  allows you to create a more engaging,No
,,,  presentation so that way let 's say for,
,,,  example you 're doing a webinar,
,,,  or you 're doing a presentation or sale,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  you can pick and choose which circle,
F977vuuxAGA33,6.5,7,  that you want to go into,No
,,,  and you can skip some you do n't even,
,,,  have to go in order so that 's what make,
,,,  it more interactive,
,,,  doe that make sense so it provides,
,,,  analytics also by showing how many,
F977vuuxAGA34,7.03,7.17,  people viewed your presentation,Structure
,,,  who they shared it with and which part,
,,,  interest them most that 's amazing,
,,,  because you were not able to do that,
,,,  in the original classic prezi plus a,
,,,  you will see in a minute there 's is a,
F977vuuxAGA35,7.19,7.32,  cleaner slicker look,Structure
,,,  with subtopics and page a far a,
,,,  setting thing up,
,,,  the structure is just a lot more,
,,,  cleaner everything is structured,
,,,  properly,
F977vuuxAGA36,7.34,7.44,  and it 's just a lot easier a far a,No
,,,  usability go,
,,,  i remember back in the day with classic,
,,,  prezi you know setting thing up wa,
,,,  actually very complicated,
,,,  once you set thing up it looked really,
F977vuuxAGA37,7.46,7.55,  nice but to get to that point,No
,,,  you literally would have to sit there,
,,,  for hour setting up a prezi,
,,,  so nowadays setting up a prezi with,
,,,  pricing next,
,,,  is just so much easier with that said,
F977vuuxAGA38,7.59,8.11,  let 's move on to,Structure
,,,  video number three,
,,,  okay so welcome back this is video,
,,,  number three,
,,,  and we 're going to talk about how to,
,,,  start your prizzy,
F977vuuxAGA39,8.13,8.27,  presentation and i 'm really going to,Structure
,,,  talk specifically about,
,,,  prezi next structure how thing are,
,,,  structured in this prezi next,
,,,  new type of update and that way you,
,,,  have a better idea of how thing are,
F977vuuxAGA40,8.29,8.36,  broken down,No
,,,  so i do n't want to jump in straight,
,,,  ahead right now i want to talk about the,
,,,  structure,
,,,  and that way you can dive straight in in,
,,,  the next video after this all right so,
F977vuuxAGA41,8.38,8.5,  let 's jump in and just take a look at a,Structure
,,,  structure,
,,,  okay so let 's jump right in so the first,
,,,  thing you 're going to see,
,,,  is in this example i just chose a random,
,,,  template,
F977vuuxAGA42,8.51,9.01,  but typically with prezi next you 're,No
,,,  going to see these little,
,,,  bubble all right so these little,
,,,  bubble are basically topic,
,,,  so the nice thing about prezi next is i,
,,,  could switch between this one,
F977vuuxAGA43,9.02,9.13,  this one and this one i do n't have to go,No
,,,  in any order,
,,,  which is nice but these are basically,
,,,  topic all right so,
,,,  when you click on one of these click,
,,,  this one here,
F977vuuxAGA44,9.14,9.26,  you 'll see these here and what these are,No
,,,  are,
,,,  are subtopics so this is the subtopic so,
,,,  we went from,
,,,  topic a a very general to sub topic,
,,,  so this right here is a subtopic so you,
F977vuuxAGA45,9.29,9.4,  can add,Structure
,,,  more element to the subtopic so if you,
,,,  click subtopic,
,,,  and there 's two topic type there 's,
,,,  planet in stack,
,,,  planet basically allows you to add more,
F977vuuxAGA46,9.42,9.52,  circle,No
,,,  so we 'll do that now you can see that,
,,,  this wa the fourth circle,
,,,  so we had one two and three and four and,
,,,  of course you can always stretch it out,
,,,  if you would like,
F977vuuxAGA47,9.56,10.06,  but it always look professional no,No
,,,  matter what,
,,,  so the thing with a classic prezi wa,
,,,  you can go all,
,,,  out and if you know you were n't really,
,,,  very creative it would be hard to make,
F977vuuxAGA48,10.09,10.19,  it really look nice,Structure
,,,  and structured so now you do n't have to,
,,,  worry about that everything is now,
,,,  very much structured now if i clicked on,
,,,  that little circle that i clicked on,
,,,  just now,
F977vuuxAGA49,10.22,10.41,  and i clicked on subtopic here,Structure
,,,  and let 's add something here,
,,,  so you can a you can see you can add,
,,,  in more subtopics more subtopics and,
,,,  more,
,,,  now we could add slack topic type,
F977vuuxAGA50,10.45,10.58,  like this and with slack topic type,No
,,,  a you can see now it look like a,
,,,  powerpoint presentation,
,,,  but now you can add page underneath,
,,,  so think about page kind of like a,
,,,  powerpoint slide,
F977vuuxAGA51,11,11.1,  so they 're all they are is really just,Structure
,,,  different element,
,,,  different way to kind of showcase,
,,,  what you 're trying to teach what you 're,
,,,  trying to present,
,,,  so just to recap we 've got topic at the,
F977vuuxAGA52,11.13,11.23,  top,Structure
,,,  sub topic below that and you can do a,
,,,  many sub topic,
,,,  and then you can also do page a well,
,,,  so a long a you understand kind of how,
,,,  that is structured,
F977vuuxAGA53,11.26,11.37,  then getting creative and making your,Structure
,,,  presentation look really nice,
,,,  is actually a breeze so i just wanted to,
,,,  cover that,
,,,  initially before we actually jumped,
,,,  right in so,
F977vuuxAGA54,11.38,11.53,  now you understand how thing are set up,No
,,,  hello and welcome back this is video,
,,,  number four and let 's talk about the,
,,,  prezi site overview and i want to give,
,,,  you,
,,,  a better overview of before we jump in,
F977vuuxAGA55,11.56,12.08,  the template how to choose them we 'll,No
,,,  talk about prezi next,
,,,  the app and how basically everything,
,,,  work,
,,,  before we begin to edit and customize a,
,,,  prezi okay so in this particular video,
F977vuuxAGA56,12.11,12.25,  i 'm not really going to show you how to,Structure
,,,  build a prezi from scratch but i want to,
,,,  give you kind of an overarching,
,,,  overview of the prezi dashboard,
,,,  the app and all that 's available to you,
,,,  so that you know,
F977vuuxAGA57,12.26,12.37,  what the difference are between each,Structure
,,,  and that way you can make a better,
,,,  decision,
,,,  on what route you want to go,
,,,  now if you are just getting started i 'm,
,,,  not really aware,
F977vuuxAGA58,12.38,12.48,  of whether you 're able to see prezi,No
,,,  classic or not,
,,,  that may be something that is just,
,,,  available to older,
,,,  customer but if you do see prezi,
,,,  classic,
F977vuuxAGA59,12.49,12.59,  i highly recommend that you just stick,Structure
,,,  with prezi next,
,,,  and the reason being is because prezi,
,,,  next is just so much,
,,,  easier it 's structured everything look,
,,,  nice,
F977vuuxAGA60,13,13.12,  and it just give you more flexibility,No
,,,  without,
,,,  all the tedious work prezi classic we,
,,,  just happened to be very,
,,,  well versed with it so we know a little,
,,,  bit more about it but,
F977vuuxAGA61,13.13,13.25,  after we tested at prezi next recently,No
,,,  which is why if we go to prezi classic,
,,,  you 'll see that we have about 21,
,,,  presentation so we 've really been using,
,,,  prezi,
,,,  classic but prezi next on the other hand,
F977vuuxAGA62,13.29,13.37,  we 've only tested a few but from what,No
,,,  we 've tested we,
,,,  found that a lot of the prezis you 'll,
,,,  notice,
,,,  they have the circle of course you can,
,,,  change the circle,
F977vuuxAGA63,13.38,13.48,  to something else but they look very,No
,,,  similar,
,,,  they the layout is very similar they,
,,,  look sleeker,
,,,  more beautiful more engaging and all of,
,,,  that so,
F977vuuxAGA64,13.49,14,  just want to say if you are getting,No
,,,  started just start out with prezi next,
,,,  do n't go with anything else,
,,,  so the nice thing about president next,
,,,  also is you are able to see,
,,,  the analytics you can actually see the,
F977vuuxAGA65,14.03,14.14,  stats and that 's something that you wa,No
,,,  you were never really able to do with,
,,,  the older version now there is a prezi,
,,,  next app,
,,,  so a you can see here i 'm using,
,,,  a window computer and i have the prezi,
F977vuuxAGA66,14.18,14.28,  window app here the main difference is,No
,,,  just,
,,,  you know i 'm editing it on my window,
,,,  computer versus editing,
,,,  with the browser now,
,,,  you will also notice that they also have,
F977vuuxAGA67,14.31,14.43,  mobile apps too so it really depends on,No
,,,  your preference sometimes,
,,,  some people depend being who they are,
,,,  may want to edit on window may want to,
,,,  edit on the browser,
,,,  or even may want to edit on the mobile,
F977vuuxAGA68,14.46,14.56,  app so,No
,,,  really what it come down to is it 's not,
,,,  that something is better than the other,
,,,  it 's just a matter of preference,
,,,  which route do you want to take all,
,,,  right,
F977vuuxAGA69,14.59,15.09,  okay so welcome back this is video,Structure
,,,  number five,
,,,  and we 're gon na dive straight in and,
,,,  talk about how to start,
,,,  a new prezi basically,
,,,  building a prezi from scratch you can,
F977vuuxAGA70,15.12,15.24,  either build it from complete scratch,Structure
,,,  or you can actually just use a template,
,,,  which is actually a simpler route i,
,,,  highly recommend that route,
,,,  and for those of you who are super,
,,,  creative and,
F977vuuxAGA71,15.25,15.36,  i highly recommend if you really really,Structure
,,,  have,
,,,  started out using template and you 've,
,,,  gotten,
,,,  really well versed with the template,
,,,  then and only then do i actually,
F977vuuxAGA72,15.37,15.48,  recommend that you actually start from,Structure
,,,  a clean slate but if you 've never used,
,,,  prezi next before,
,,,  i highly recommend that you start with,
,,,  the template first,
,,,  get used to the actual animation the,
F977vuuxAGA73,15.51,16.01,  option and all of that,Structure
,,,  first before you move to a little bit,
,,,  more advanced all right so,
,,,  let 's start with some of the basic and,
,,,  move from there right so,
,,,  let 's go ahead and click new,
F977vuuxAGA74,16.03,16.16,  presentation,No
,,,  and let me go ahead and walk you around,
,,,  now you will notice that it doe take a,
,,,  little bit of time to load,
,,,  so depending on your internet connection,
,,,  and there you go so,
F977vuuxAGA75,16.17,16.29,  a you can see here we got many,Structure
,,,  different category we got sale and,
,,,  development we have marketing,
,,,  education hr and training in general,
,,,  and you 've got a huge amount of,
,,,  template,
F977vuuxAGA76,16.3,16.41,  really good looking template and in my,No
,,,  mind,
,,,  compared to the prezi classic,
,,,  this is just way better of course prezi,
,,,  compared to powerpoint the original,
,,,  classic version,
F977vuuxAGA77,16.42,16.57,  i thought wa better than powerpoint,No
,,,  regardless so these are just the,
,,,  a certain amount of template you have,
,,,  access to and a you can see you have,
,,,  a huge huge amount of template,
,,,  all right so let 's just go ahead and,
F977vuuxAGA78,16.58,17.14,  pick one of these and let 's just,No
,,,  go ahead and run with it so let 's go,
,,,  ahead and,
,,,  let 's just choose this one here alright,
,,,  so click on it,
,,,  it 's loading the template preview so we,
F977vuuxAGA79,17.17,17.29,  have a better idea of what it look like,No
,,,  so the nice thing about prezi is you,
,,,  know you can change the background you,
,,,  could change it to,
,,,  an image of your company of your,
,,,  building,
F977vuuxAGA80,17.3,17.41,  or you can change it to something else,No
,,,  it really is up to you so that 's where,
,,,  the customization process,
,,,  come in so the nice thing about this is,
,,,  you can take a look at it and see,
,,,  you know is this really right for me do,
F977vuuxAGA81,17.43,17.54,  i really want,No
,,,  to use this and let 's,
,,,  just go ahead and click use this,
,,,  template,
,,,  okay so that took a little bit more time,
,,,  but i went ahead and paused that so that,
F977vuuxAGA82,17.56,18.09,  we can zoom forward,No
,,,  but up at the top you can of course,
,,,  change the title of,
,,,  your prezi,
,,,  so we could call this sale pitch one,
,,,  you 've got file you can do new prezi you,
F977vuuxAGA83,18.12,18.24,  can save you can show info,No
,,,  about the prezi,
,,,  you can show your prezi so obviously,
,,,  this would go out,
,,,  and go to your other prezis which is not,
,,,  what we really want to do,
F977vuuxAGA84,18.26,18.36,  you can insert topic you can insert,No
,,,  text,
,,,  chart image video even,
,,,  to make it even more engaging shape,
,,,  arrow,
,,,  line icon and symbol,
F977vuuxAGA85,18.39,18.51,  comment and animation so there are a,No
,,,  lot of,
,,,  variety of different element that you,
,,,  can insert,
,,,  you can hide the background,
,,,  you could hide comment or show,
F977vuuxAGA86,18.53,19.02,  animation,No
,,,  you can go into presentation mode viewer,
,,,  presentation viewer you can preview it,
,,,  or,
,,,  see what it look like live so you 're,
,,,  really not going to need these until,
F977vuuxAGA87,19.04,19.13,  you 're actually,Structure
,,,  done with everything else now like i,
,,,  said earlier we have,
,,,  topic and then of course when you drill,
,,,  down,
,,,  further you will be able to see,
F977vuuxAGA88,19.15,19.27,  subtopics,No
,,,  like so and then you 're able to drill,
,,,  further,
,,,  which then will allow you to see page,
,,,  so before like i showed you there were,
,,,  page and then,
F977vuuxAGA89,19.28,19.42,  subtopics and of course you can zoom,No
,,,  back,
,,,  out and you 'll see animation,
,,,  now remember how i said previously that,
,,,  what the prezi next doe is it take the,
,,,  most powerful,
F977vuuxAGA90,19.44,19.56,  feature or the strength of the,No
,,,  classic prezi and microsoft,
,,,  powerpoint and it brings it all together,
,,,  and that 's what we have here so with,
,,,  animation i could actually animate it,
,,,  so that,
F977vuuxAGA91,19.58,20.07,  i do n't want certain element to,Structure
,,,  actually appear until i actually begin,
,,,  to click,
,,,  and that 's the beauty of animation just,
,,,  like a,
,,,  powerpoint concept,
F977vuuxAGA92,20.12,20.22,  hello and welcome back this is video,Structure
,,,  number six,
,,,  and we 're gon na dive straight in and,
,,,  continue where we left off,
,,,  in the previous video where i showed you,
,,,  kind of an overview of,
F977vuuxAGA93,20.24,20.35,  how to start out your prezi next,No
,,,  presentation and now we 're going to dive,
,,,  in and talk about editing and,
,,,  customization,
,,,  and we 'll talk about customizing your,
,,,  prezi your image your color and your,
F977vuuxAGA94,20.37,20.46,  animation,No
,,,  and everything else okay so now that you,
,,,  understand how thing are structured,
,,,  when it come to editing,
,,,  customization grabbing you know,
,,,  inserting image,
F977vuuxAGA95,20.48,20.59,  grabbing image out inserting your own,No
,,,  image all that,
,,,  it 's actually very easy process once,
,,,  you 're utilizing a template,
,,,  but like i said once you master the,
,,,  template process you can actually move,
F977vuuxAGA96,21,21.13,  straight into,Structure
,,,  beginning to start with a clean slate,
,,,  and do your own thing kind of thing,
,,,  so let 's just go ahead and go ahead and,
,,,  customize from the top,
,,,  down to the bottom so now we 're taking a,
F977vuuxAGA97,21.14,21.24,  look at the overview which is the,Structure
,,,  overarching,
,,,  view of everything and,
,,,  before i actually even move into,
,,,  anything let 's start kind of like a,
,,,  cumulative order,
F977vuuxAGA98,21.26,21.38,  so that it 's a better understandable,Structure
,,,  let 's say for example that we do n't want,
,,,  certain element right here,
,,,  to appear until we move forward,
,,,  so we can actually let 's click on the,
,,,  sale pitch for example,
F977vuuxAGA99,21.4,21.55,  and maybe the background,No
,,,  so we 'll select that and then of course,
,,,  you can,
,,,  move that back over here and we 'll click,
,,,  animation and then i 'm going to click,
,,,  plus,
F977vuuxAGA100,21.56,22.08,  so obviously you want to select the,No
,,,  element that you want to animate,
,,,  click plus and then choose what you want,
,,,  so we could do,
,,,  fade in fade out so fade in,
,,,  would usually naturally be okay when you,
F977vuuxAGA101,22.1,22.26,  actually come in,No
,,,  and maybe later on it 'll be fade out,
,,,  we could also fade in here,
,,,  we could also initially zoom in,
,,,  a well so you can zoom in you can add a,
,,,  zoom in area,
F977vuuxAGA102,22.28,22.41,  and all that so animation is just a,Structure
,,,  really,
,,,  cool way to make thing appear,
,,,  or when they 're not appeared appear,
,,,  a you begin the presentation so,
,,,  maybe you could start out with a kind of,
F977vuuxAGA103,22.44,22.53,  just a view,Structure
,,,  of the circle the element,
,,,  the the major topic and then of course,
,,,  the,
,,,  the background and then you begin the,
,,,  presentation and it 's like wow that,
F977vuuxAGA104,22.55,23.06,  look really cool kind of thing,No
,,,  so think about it from your your viewer,
,,,  standpoint,
,,,  what would make them think wow that 's,
,,,  really interesting or,
,,,  wow i did n't expect that to even happen,
F977vuuxAGA105,23.08,23.19,  kind of thing,No
,,,  so that 's that and that 's basically how,
,,,  animation work,
,,,  you can also specify when the animation,
,,,  happen so you can have it,
,,,  at the beginning of the presentation,
F977vuuxAGA106,23.22,23.34,  after the about which is these,No
,,,  topic here so every one of these,
,,,  circle are topic remember so,
,,,  you can have the animation appear after,
,,,  every single one of these,
,,,  topic here so you can actually specify,
F977vuuxAGA107,23.37,23.46,  it,Structure
,,,  in more detail but i just wanted to show,
,,,  you some brief,
,,,  kind of overview of the animation,
,,,  element themselves,
,,,  so now i 'm going to select the about,
F977vuuxAGA108,23.49,24.01,  topic and to customize it,No
,,,  very very easy to do so,
,,,  this obviously would be good for a sale,
,,,  pitch or an about,
,,,  presentation and all you have to do to,
,,,  customize it is select it,
F977vuuxAGA109,24.03,24.17,  double click it and highlight it and,No
,,,  then of course,
,,,  your office or your name or whatever,
,,,  so office location you can,
,,,  add the text here or if you want to,
,,,  insert,
F977vuuxAGA110,24.18,24.28,  a another element you can do that a,No
,,,  well so you can insert,
,,,  up here subtopic text chart image,
,,,  video,
,,,  shape arrow line icon and symbol,
,,,  so i could also insert an icon you can,
F977vuuxAGA111,24.32,24.42,  have,No
,,,  light icon and dark icon,
,,,  so if i select light icon you can see,
,,,  they have,
,,,  a light background on the back so we can,
,,,  select,
F977vuuxAGA112,24.43,24.55,  one of these and we can simply drag and,No
,,,  drop it over here,
,,,  like so or if we go back here and we do,
,,,  dar prezzies it 's just a dark background,
,,,  here,
,,,  so that 's really the main difference,
F977vuuxAGA113,24.57,25.09,  between light prezis and,No
,,,  dark prezi icon so you can also insert,
,,,  other element a,
,,,  well if you would like to you can also,
,,,  edit out the image so if you click on,
,,,  the image here,
F977vuuxAGA114,25.1,25.26,  we can click replace image,No
,,,  so we could go and look for an image,
,,,  and we could select an image like this,
,,,  and it 'll just upload it really fast a,
,,,  you can see here,
,,,  within a few second or le than 0.1,
F977vuuxAGA115,25.28,25.41,  second actually,No
,,,  so we could do that and we could go back,
,,,  just to kind of see what it look like,
,,,  so we can zoom in like that,
,,,  and go like that and so you can see how,
,,,  easy it is you select the image you,
F977vuuxAGA116,25.43,25.54,  click replace image,No
,,,  find the image that you want like that,
,,,  and replace it,
,,,  so what you see is kind of what you get,
,,,  what you see and then you can replace,
,,,  of course the color so you could select,
F977vuuxAGA117,25.57,26.08,  this purple item and then select a,No
,,,  different color,
,,,  like that so you know if you 've used,
,,,  powerpoint you use microsoft word,
,,,  the dashboard up here is fairly easy to,
,,,  use,
F977vuuxAGA118,26.1,26.19,  but you 'll notice that it change,No
,,,  depending on the element,
,,,  that you choose so if you choose an,
,,,  image it 'll tell you,
,,,  replace an image if you choose you know,
,,,  a color block it 'll tell you there 's,
F977vuuxAGA119,26.21,26.31,  different option for the color block,No
,,,  if you choose text on the other hand you,
,,,  have the opportunity to,
,,,  you know change the size increase it,
,,,  change the font,
,,,  type you can bold italicize background,
F977vuuxAGA120,26.34,26.43,  color,No
,,,  the color alignment so really basic,
,,,  stuff when it come to,
,,,  text stuff that you would see in a,
,,,  pretty much most word processing system,
,,,  now let 's say you want to add something,
F977vuuxAGA121,26.45,26.58,  and you you know you do n't like,No
,,,  where this image is so you can actually,
,,,  select the image and move it around,
,,,  and you can move the text around a well,
,,,  you do n't have to necessarily stick with,
,,,  the exact,
F977vuuxAGA122,26.59,27.1,  position of everything you know how,No
,,,  thing are set up in term of the,
,,,  template so if you do n't like something,
,,,  you know feel free to move it around you,
,,,  can actually do that very very easily,
,,,  with prezi now,
F977vuuxAGA123,27.13,27.3,  let 's say we want to zoom in,No
,,,  we can actually zoom in but we can also,
,,,  zoom out a well so let 's go back,
,,,  out and go back to overview,
,,,  and you might be wondering can you,
,,,  actually you know move thing around,
F977vuuxAGA124,27.32,27.42,  you know let 's say i do n't really want,Structure
,,,  this background here,
,,,  let 's say i want my own background well,
,,,  you can do that,
,,,  by going back to the overview clicking,
,,,  on background option,
F977vuuxAGA125,27.44,27.55,  and you can either upload a background,No
,,,  image you can revert,
,,,  to the template background if you make a,
,,,  mistake you can,
,,,  remove background image like so,
,,,  or we can revert back to this so,
F977vuuxAGA126,27.59,28.12,  one thing one place that i will tell you,No
,,,  to get your image from is,
,,,  bigstockphoto.com,
,,,  there are a lot of other place that you,
,,,  can go to to get image a well,
,,,  there are there 's pixabay.com there,
F977vuuxAGA127,28.16,28.28,  is also pixel p e x,No
,,,  e l s dot com you can also get really,
,,,  beautiful image there,
,,,  royalty free one so obviously if you 're,
,,,  doing this for,
,,,  like business related you 're going to,
F977vuuxAGA128,28.3,28.41,  want to get a commercial license so,No
,,,  you 're going to,
,,,  need to pay for the image that you use,
,,,  so with that said that aside if you,
,,,  click upload background image let 's just,
,,,  choose an image so,
F977vuuxAGA129,28.44,28.59,  let 's go and let 's see here,No
,,,  let 's maybe choose,
,,,  this one here so obviously this relates,
,,,  to outsourcing but you can see these,
,,,  have,
,,,  little circle and that 's actually,
F977vuuxAGA130,29.01,29.11,  really,Structure
,,,  convenient because i can actually move,
,,,  these circle topic here so let 's say,
,,,  for example,
,,,  i want to move this here and i want to,
,,,  make the circle a little bit bigger,
F977vuuxAGA131,29.14,29.26,  so that it fit perfectly on this here,No
,,,  so obviously the finger,
,,,  pointing here but i could put it over,
,,,  here i could,
,,,  you know put this over here and make it,
,,,  bigger so it fit the circle perfectly,
F977vuuxAGA132,29.28,29.46,  like that and i could do the same thing,No
,,,  over here,
,,,  like so so a you can see you can move,
,,,  the circle around now you 'll notice a,
,,,  i move the circle around you,
,,,  do you see those yellow line well those,
F977vuuxAGA133,29.49,30.03,  yellow line are pointing,No
,,,  to the circle so depending on the order,
,,,  that you have it in right now,
,,,  is the order that it 'll go through if,
,,,  you use the arrow the right arrow to,
,,,  move forward,
F977vuuxAGA134,30.04,30.16,  but you can obviously use the mouse to,No
,,,  select either or,
,,,  whatever item that you want and go into,
,,,  any order that you want but like i said,
,,,  if you do want to go in order you can,
,,,  and you can use the right arrow on your,
F977vuuxAGA135,30.18,30.3,  keyboard to essentially go,No
,,,  from one two three four five six,
,,,  but if i want to move let 's say for,
,,,  example six to number two,
,,,  i could easily do that and then of,
,,,  course it switch,
F977vuuxAGA136,30.32,30.42,  but i wanted to show you how easy it wa,No
,,,  see with the template,
,,,  you have the opportunity like you do n't,
,,,  have to use,
,,,  the way the lay thing are laid out or,
,,,  anything like that,
F977vuuxAGA137,30.43,30.54,  you can actually tweak it to your own,No
,,,  liking,
,,,  like that so there you go so you can see,
,,,  that i tweaked it i,
,,,  imported a background and that 's what it,
,,,  look like,
F977vuuxAGA138,30.55,31.05,  now within the subtopic excel you can,No
,,,  actually,
,,,  edit just the same way select it double,
,,,  click it,
,,,  to edit the text and of course i can add,
,,,  a subtopic remember you have two topic,
F977vuuxAGA139,31.07,31.2,  type you have planet or stack,Structure
,,,  planet basically add the circle around,
,,,  here so i could add,
,,,  another subtopic and it 'll appear here,
,,,  i can move it anywhere way i want i 'm,
,,,  going to leave it a it is i can add,
F977vuuxAGA140,31.21,31.36,  another subtopic,No
,,,  and another one like so,
,,,  and of course if i want kind of a,
,,,  powerpoint slide look,
,,,  i can choose the stack a you can see,
,,,  here so stack is going to look like this,
F977vuuxAGA141,31.38,31.49,  where they zoom all the way further in,No
,,,  and it look like a powerpoint slide,
,,,  and this is actually something that we,
,,,  we did,
,,,  for a while with prezi classic but,
,,,  it 's not something that you could easily,
F977vuuxAGA142,31.5,32.01,  do with prezi classic and that 's why i,No
,,,  recommend,
,,,  if you 're new to all this stick with,
,,,  prezi next all right,
,,,  so that 's pretty much the premise on how,
,,,  to use,
F977vuuxAGA143,32.02,32.15,  prezi,No
,,,  okay so welcome to video number seven,
,,,  and we,
,,,  are gon na go ahead and jump right in and,
,,,  talk about shortcut key,
,,,  so shortcut key are basically key,
F977vuuxAGA144,32.18,32.28,  within,Structure
,,,  prezi that have been programmed to allow,
,,,  you to speed thing up,
,,,  now you do n't really want to do this,
,,,  until you get a hang of at least a few,
,,,  template,
F977vuuxAGA145,32.29,32.4,  but once you actually understand the,No
,,,  dashboard and,
,,,  how everything is laid out then i,
,,,  recommend using shortcut key,
,,,  so that way you can just speed thing up,
,,,  and,
F977vuuxAGA146,32.41,32.52,  what would normally take you maybe 15,No
,,,  minute can now literally take you,
,,,  a click of a button all right so that,
,,,  said let 's,
,,,  jump right in okay so let 's go ahead and,
,,,  dive in,
F977vuuxAGA147,32.53,33.03,  everybody want to eventually speed up,Structure
,,,  the process,
,,,  nobody in that is watching this probably,
,,,  want to do it the wrong way but like i,
,,,  said,
,,,  if you actually you know start out,
F977vuuxAGA148,33.06,33.14,  working with template once you get a,No
,,,  hang of it,
,,,  then i 'd highly recommend that you use,
,,,  this that way you can understand the,
,,,  whole process,
,,,  of how everything work and that way,
F977vuuxAGA149,33.16,33.26,  you 're,No
,,,  better equipped with knowing when to,
,,,  actually use shortcut key,
,,,  now you do n't have to remember the exact,
,,,  key,
,,,  i 'm going to show you an article from,
F977vuuxAGA150,33.28,33.38,  prezi,Structure
,,,  where you 'll be able to get access to,
,,,  this article and you know utilize,
,,,  the shortcut key you can print out have,
,,,  it on your wall so you can always refer,
,,,  back to it later on,
F977vuuxAGA151,33.4,33.53,  but for now i just want to show it to,No
,,,  you in action,
,,,  so let 's say we,
,,,  want to select everything that is on,
,,,  this page so let 's do that so if you,
,,,  click control a now obviously this is,
F977vuuxAGA152,33.56,34.09,  going to be different,No
,,,  with mac computer it might be command,
,,,  a but what i just did wa i selected,
,,,  everything all the topic so control,
,,,  a is select all and that 's pretty,
,,,  standard with,
F977vuuxAGA153,34.11,34.24,  most word processing or even browser,No
,,,  function is,
,,,  ctrl a selects all by selecting all that,
,,,  enables you to move thing around,
,,,  a little bit better so instead of moving,
,,,  item like little,
F977vuuxAGA154,34.26,34.37,  topic one by one by one you can,No
,,,  literally select,
,,,  everything and move it around so you can,
,,,  select and move,
,,,  here and move it here now,
,,,  i could select all and i can also copy,
F977vuuxAGA155,34.4,34.51,  by clicking control,No
,,,  c or command key and control v,
,,,  which will basically copy everything,
,,,  now i do n't see where you would actually,
,,,  need to do that,
,,,  unless you had a lot of these item,
F977vuuxAGA156,34.54,35.05,  right,No
,,,  so if we were we wanted something,
,,,  similar to this,
,,,  maybe what we wanted to do is select,
,,,  that item,
,,,  so that 's number five,
F977vuuxAGA157,35.1,35.23,  so let 's see here that 's this one here,Structure
,,,  so that 's the timeline so i could select,
,,,  the timeline,
,,,  i could do control c control v,
,,,  and by doing control v you saw that now,
,,,  it 's there 's a number seven,
F977vuuxAGA158,35.25,35.35,  and it 's copied this exact element so if,Structure
,,,  you like an element and you want,
,,,  to kind of base it upon that very,
,,,  element because you 've done everything,
,,,  right,
,,,  then you can do control c and control v,
F977vuuxAGA159,35.38,35.52,  alright now if i want to go further in,Structure
,,,  let 's say,
,,,  let 's double click on this and we like,
,,,  the way this is set up,
,,,  and maybe we want another element,
,,,  we could do control c control v or,
F977vuuxAGA160,35.56,36.1,  maybe we just want to copy and paste,No
,,,  this,
,,,  text right here so,
,,,  you would want to select it like so,
,,,  and you can see that i 've clicked,
,,,  control c,
F977vuuxAGA161,36.1,36.21,  control v i 've copied and pasted and you,No
,,,  can see,
,,,  a duplicate so,
,,,  let 's say for example we want this one,
,,,  over here,
,,,  so what you do is you want to select the,
F977vuuxAGA162,36.24,36.34,  element so,No
,,,  if you look fairly carefully my mouse,
,,,  go over,
,,,  and this item highlight so,
,,,  i can actually select the item and let 's,
,,,  say i want to select this one this one,
F977vuuxAGA163,36.36,36.47,  and this one,No
,,,  to do that i 'll need to hold down the,
,,,  control,
,,,  key,
,,,  like that control c control v,
,,,  and you can actually duplicate it and,
F977vuuxAGA164,36.5,37.02,  there we go,No
,,,  so now i will say that took a little bit,
,,,  of time to do that but i can move it,
,,,  over here,
,,,  i can move this over here like that,
,,,  all right so that 's control c control v,
F977vuuxAGA165,37.05,37.15,  which are probably the most common,No
,,,  shortcut key that you 're,
,,,  actually going to use now let 's talk,
,,,  about some other shortcut key,
,,,  now i will say before you use keyboard,
,,,  shortcut key,
F977vuuxAGA166,37.17,37.28,  and you go to prezi and you search for,No
,,,  them you will notice that,
,,,  some will say this support page is only,
,,,  so there are some keyboard shortcut key,
,,,  that are only for,
,,,  prezi classic specifically so you only,
F977vuuxAGA167,37.3,37.4,  want to do,No
,,,  the one that are for prezi next if,
,,,  you 're using prezi next and the one for,
,,,  prezi classic if you 're using prezi,
,,,  classic,
,,,  but a you can see here there are,
F977vuuxAGA168,37.41,37.51,  different one for window and mac,No
,,,  obviously because there are different,
,,,  key on the different platform and,
,,,  different,
,,,  computer but with window you can see,
,,,  it 's ctrl a,
F977vuuxAGA169,37.52,38.01,  with mac it 's ctrl a to select all ctrl,No
,,,  c,
,,,  ctrl x is to cut it cut it mean that if,
,,,  you,
,,,  cut it it 'll disappear and then of,
,,,  course you can copy it somewhere else,
F977vuuxAGA170,38.05,38.15,  you can do all backspace to delete,Structure
,,,  you can do command and to drag thing,
,,,  around,
,,,  and there 's other element here a well,
,,,  to move thing around,
,,,  but for the most part you 're probably,
F977vuuxAGA171,38.17,38.31,  going to use these,No
,,,  right here a this is more common,
,,,  so to get here obviously let me give you,
,,,  the url,
,,,  of the link if you go to,
,,,  slash www.prezi.com slash kb,
F977vuuxAGA172,38.35,38.48,  slash create dash your dash,No
,,,  prezi no s so prezi,
,,,  slash shortcut now if you want to just,
,,,  go,
,,,  to their database you can do that and do,
,,,  a search just make sure,
F977vuuxAGA173,38.5,39.01,  that it say this support page is about,No
,,,  prezi next,
,,,  because there wa another keyboard,
,,,  shortcut,
,,,  page that wa specifically for the prezi,
,,,  classic so i wanted to make mention of,
F977vuuxAGA174,39.04,39.12,  that so,No
,,,  you do n't get confused you do n't learn,
,,,  something that is,
,,,  totally different and not related and,
,,,  that way you do n't lose time,
,,,  alright so with that said let 's move on,
F977vuuxAGA175,39.14,39.29,  to the next video,No
,,,  hey and welcome back this is video,
,,,  number eight and this is kind of a bonus,
,,,  video but for those of you who want to,
,,,  take it a step further and rather than,
,,,  using prezi for just,
F977vuuxAGA176,39.3,39.41,  something that sits out on the internet,Structure
,,,  or something,
,,,  for a live presentation for those of you,
,,,  who want to make an actual video,
,,,  this is for you alright so we 're going,
,,,  to talk about how to add,
F977vuuxAGA177,39.42,39.55,  voiceovers how to add background sound,No
,,,  how to essentially make a video,
,,,  but for those of you who really want to,
,,,  go all out and,
,,,  you 're you 're not really looking to make,
,,,  a prezi to just do,
F977vuuxAGA178,39.56,40.08,  a live kind of presentation,No
,,,  or just send it to people you really,
,,,  want to turn this into a video,
,,,  then you are going to need to have an,
,,,  actual,
,,,  video recording software so in this case,
F977vuuxAGA179,40.11,40.24,  i am using camtasia you can use,No
,,,  screenflow for mac,
,,,  there are other apps out there a well,
,,,  but for the most part i found,
,,,  camtasia tends to be the best,
,,,  i 've tested camtasia on the mac i really,
F977vuuxAGA180,40.26,40.36,  like it i feel like it ha,No
,,,  evolved and become better,
,,,  and maybe it 's just a little bit of a,
,,,  preference but i 've used camtasia for a,
,,,  long time,
,,,  and that 's what i use now,
F977vuuxAGA181,40.4,40.54,  here 's the thing here 's a little trick i,No
,,,  found you can use,
,,,  browser or you can use the window or,
,,,  the mac app now when it came to,
,,,  classic prezi i found that utilizing the,
,,,  actual,
F977vuuxAGA182,40.55,41.08,  downloadable window or mac app wa,No
,,,  easier,
,,,  but that time have changed,
,,,  and if you click on prezi and we go with,
,,,  prezi next and click on present,
,,,  this is what it look like so in reality,
F977vuuxAGA183,41.11,41.27,  i found that they 've made prezi next,No
,,,  very very easy to use and,
,,,  you can either use a browser version or,
,,,  you can use the window or mac app,
,,,  so if you 're now if you 're using the,
,,,  classic prezi,
F977vuuxAGA184,41.29,41.43,  then what i found is it 's just easier,No
,,,  to use the downloadable window or mac,
,,,  app if you 're using prezi next it,
,,,  doe n't matter,
,,,  use browser or you can also use the,
,,,  downloadable app,
F977vuuxAGA185,41.45,41.58,  both actually work so,No
,,,  learn from me because you know i 've,
,,,  recorded many video,
,,,  and since then made a lot of prezis,
,,,  and the prezis are the classic prezis,
,,,  were actually very difficult,
F977vuuxAGA186,41.59,42.1,  to record because a lot of time the,No
,,,  reason why wa a lot of time,
,,,  the browser app thing would just get in,
,,,  the way,
,,,  and it 'd be really hard to record so i,
,,,  think thing have evolved over the year,
F977vuuxAGA187,42.13,42.25,  but,No
,,,  that said you will need to have,
,,,  camtasia or screenflow so in order to do,
,,,  this,
,,,  you will need obviously to dish out,
,,,  either 150 to 300,
F977vuuxAGA188,42.29,42.39,  to get access to these software you,No
,,,  will also need to have,
,,,  a microphone either a usb microphone or,
,,,  a more professional microphone,
,,,  i believe with mac computer you can,
,,,  easily use,
F977vuuxAGA189,42.4,42.53,  the the microphone earbuds you can use,No
,,,  those a well,
,,,  to record a video but all you do is just,
,,,  go into presentation mode,
,,,  now that you have an idea of prezi,
,,,  classic versus prezi next,
F977vuuxAGA190,42.56,43.07,  all you have to do is click present,No
,,,  now you 'll notice that if i put my mouse,
,,,  down here this little thing pop up and,
,,,  then,
,,,  you 're wondering okay how do i get rid,
,,,  of this little bar so to get rid of it,
F977vuuxAGA191,43.1,43.19,  you just put your mouse,No
,,,  back up here and you click so you can,
,,,  see that my mouse is,
,,,  is hiding so before actually when i wa,
,,,  recording the other video,
,,,  my mouse wa over here and it wa hiding,
F977vuuxAGA192,43.22,43.37,  so that 's kind of how to do,No
,,,  it now with camtasia let me go over to,
,,,  camtasia,
,,,  you are going to want to use,
,,,  and i ca n't really show that now but,
,,,  you 're going to click on record the,
F977vuuxAGA193,43.38,43.47,  screen,No
,,,  and you want to use full screen so you,
,,,  want to show or record,
,,,  the whole screen and then typically,
,,,  after that once you have recorded it you,
,,,  want to get it down to,
F977vuuxAGA194,43.49,44.02,  1280 by 720 editing dimension which is,No
,,,  hd quality standard and,
,,,  another thing is depending on how big,
,,,  your resolution is,
,,,  if your resolution is a smaller,
,,,  resolution,
F977vuuxAGA195,44.04,44.13,  you might have kind of a little bit of a,Structure
,,,  distorted view,
,,,  and you might need to kind of play,
,,,  around with that but when it come to,
,,,  editing,
,,,  let 's say for this one here if and when,
F977vuuxAGA196,44.17,44.28,  you have element that are like popping,No
,,,  up or in the way,
,,,  you can use the zoom and pan feature and,
,,,  you go here,
,,,  and you just move it up like that so you,
,,,  can move it up,
F977vuuxAGA197,44.29,44.39,  obviously it crop out certain element,No
,,,  of the actual video,
,,,  but then you remove the element that,
,,,  are popping in and all that so,
,,,  that 's something good to know i mean,
,,,  i 've made so many pretty video over the,
F977vuuxAGA198,44.41,44.5,  year that,Structure
,,,  i 've realized there are certain element,
,,,  certain thing that,
,,,  you 'll run into along the way that,
,,,  you 'll never really know,
,,,  unless you actually do it so like i said,
F977vuuxAGA199,44.52,45.05,  you got to do it a few time,Structure
,,,  sometimes a few time sometimes 10 time,
,,,  sometimes 20 time until you perfect,
,,,  your own process but that 's fine that 's,
,,,  that 's part of the game,
,,,  and at the end of the day you know some,
F977vuuxAGA200,45.07,45.2,  of your video that start out,No
,,,  maybe slow now some people ask okay,
,,,  when you make video do you just uh,
,,,  record,
,,,  the voice first and then you kind of,
,,,  show,
F977vuuxAGA201,45.21,45.32,  the prezi in action or do you,No
,,,  actually walk through while you 're,
,,,  showing the prezi,
,,,  what i found to answer that it 's,
,,,  different from different,
,,,  people some people can do you know teach,
F977vuuxAGA202,45.34,45.47,  really really fast,No
,,,  and a they do the prezi and some people,
,,,  a they start out they have to actually,
,,,  read a script and then implement it and,
,,,  have one track a the audio and one,
,,,  track,
F977vuuxAGA203,45.47,45.59,  a the prezi visual so sometimes you,No
,,,  might have to write out the script,
,,,  and read the script and put it down here,
,,,  and then you have to go back,
,,,  and then record kind of the video,
,,,  of the prezi and go along with the,
F977vuuxAGA204,46.01,46.1,  script so,No
,,,  it really depends on you and how you,
,,,  speak some of you might be comfortable,
,,,  with speaking like like me i can just go,
,,,  straight in and teach,
,,,  and some of you might not be comfortable,
F977vuuxAGA205,46.12,46.24,  and you might have to go with a script,Structure
,,,  now i will say you know it definitely,
,,,  take practice,
,,,  and even sometimes making video,
,,,  it might be the tenth time but at the,
,,,  end of the day you have to practice,
F977vuuxAGA206,46.26,46.39,  just like riding a bicycle everything,No
,,,  take practice,
,,,  so hopefully that teach you a little,
,,,  bit about how to turn your prezi,
,,,  into a video,
,,,  so congratulation you have reached the,
F977vuuxAGA207,46.42,46.49,  end of,No
,,,  this video course which is video number,
,,,  nine and,
,,,  in video number nine it 's going to be a,
,,,  fairly brief,
,,,  video but i want to show you how to,
F977vuuxAGA208,46.51,47.04,  collaborate via prezi,No
,,,  and how to reach out to your team how to,
,,,  get your team to even work on the prezi,
,,,  and how to use prezi for,
,,,  other thing besides of that and,
,,,  let 's go ahead and dive in,
F977vuuxAGA209,47.08,47.18,  so there are different way to have your,Structure
,,,  team,
,,,  collaborate on a prezi you can have them,
,,,  edit the prezi,
,,,  and build it out together or you can,
,,,  just have them come in,
F977vuuxAGA210,47.2,47.3,  and view the prezi so this feature is,No
,,,  actually very simple to use all you have,
,,,  to do is up at the top right hand corner,
,,,  you 're going to see this little people,
,,,  icon,
,,,  you want to click that and then you can,
F977vuuxAGA211,47.32,47.41,  see that,Structure
,,,  currently there are currently no,
,,,  collaborator in this prezi,
,,,  so what you want to do is click on total,
,,,  collaborator,
,,,  you 'll want to enter their email address,
F977vuuxAGA212,47.45,47.54,  and then before you click on add there,No
,,,  are different option here you can,
,,,  edit so in other word you can give,
,,,  somebody,
,,,  edit right you may not want to do that,
,,,  unless,
F977vuuxAGA213,47.55,48.05,  uh that person is somebody you trust you,No
,,,  can,
,,,  have somebody comment so they can make,
,,,  comment on the prezi itself,
,,,  so maybe this is a presentation to a,
,,,  client,
F977vuuxAGA214,48.06,48.16,  you might want to just give them you,Structure
,,,  know presentation right,
,,,  so essentially these are right that you,
,,,  can give,
,,,  so if you want somebody like your,
,,,  universal assistant,
F977vuuxAGA215,48.18,48.29,  or your somebody employee or somebody on,Structure
,,,  your team,
,,,  you might want to give them edit right,
,,,  and then the can,
,,,  comment and then can present is somebody,
,,,  who,
F977vuuxAGA216,48.3,48.41,  might be a client might be somebody,No
,,,  presenting it maybe you do n't really,
,,,  want them to have,
,,,  those edit right because keep in mind,
,,,  if you do give somebody edit right,
,,,  they have the ability to literally ruin,
F977vuuxAGA217,48.43,48.52,  your whole prezi so,No
,,,  just give somebody that you trust those,
,,,  right,
,,,  and that 's how easy it is to use and of,
,,,  course besides collaboration you have,
,,,  the ability to share,
F977vuuxAGA219,48.53,49.34,  and you can create a link you can,No
,,,  enter the company or the,
,,,  client 's name in here you click create,
,,,  link,
,,,  and you can also track prezi analytics,
,,,  and more but for the most part for,
,,,  collaborates you 're going to use the,
,,,  show collaborator button,
,,,  and that 's it you 're good to go,
,,,  you,
kw_udjD2xwo1,0.09,0.32,  If you really want to add some excitement to your presentation try adding some animation .,No
,,,  PowerPoint ha a wide variety of animated effect that can be applied to text and other,
,,,  object .,
,,,  In this example I 'm creating a very basic quiz that ha a question on each slide .,
,,,  I 'd like to add animation to these two text box ... and also the man on top of the moon .,
,,,  To get started select the first object you want you want to animate ... then go to the,
kw_udjD2xwo2,0.37,0.55,  Animations tab .,No
,,,  Next click the drop down arrow to see all the available effect .,
,,,  There are four different category : Entrance which will happen when the object,
,,,  first appears ...,
,,,  Emphasis which happens while the object is on the slide ...,
,,,  Exit which will cause the object to disappear ...,
kw_udjD2xwo3,0.59,1.24,  And Motion Paths which will move the object along a path .,No
,,,  I 'm going to choose the one called Fly In which is an Entrance effect .,
,,,  For some effect you 'll have different Effect Options that you can choose from .,
,,,  As you can see this one let you change the direction .,
,,,  Let 's say I wanted to add second animation to the text .,
,,,  If we try to select one from the main menu it 's actually going to replace the current,
kw_udjD2xwo4,1.28,1.47,  effect .,No
,,,  Instead we 'll click the command that say Add Animation ... and we can apply additional,
,,,  effect to the same object .,
,,,  You can always tell which object have animation because they 'll have little number next to,
,,,  them?one for each effect .,
,,,  The thumbnail for the slide will also have a star icon .,
kw_udjD2xwo5,1.51,2.14,  If you want to preview the effect just click the Preview command any time .,No
,,,  Now the key to using animation effectively is moderation .,
,,,  Say we wanted to add an effect to the answer text a well .,
,,,  We do n't want anything too bold like say the Swivel effect because it might be distracting,
,,,  to the audience .,
,,,  Instead I 'm just going to set it to slowly fade in which should really help the answer,
kw_udjD2xwo6,2.19,2.41,  shine .,No
,,,  It 's also important to note that not every object need an animation .,
,,,  This is especially true in more corporate or professional setting .,
,,,  In this case we 're creating a fairly casual presentation?so I 'm going to add one more,
,,,  effect to our little astronaut but leave the rest of the slide alone .,
,,,  At this point we have several animation to keep track of so it might be a good time,
kw_udjD2xwo7,2.48,3.07,  to open the Animation Pane .,No
,,,  The pane appears on the right and let you do a few different thing .,
,,,  You can click and drag the effect to change the order that they play in ... and you can,
,,,  use the drop arrow to access even more option .,
,,,  By default animation are set to start when you click the mouse but I do n't want to have,
,,,  to do that for every single one .,
kw_udjD2xwo8,3.09,3.37,  Instead we can have some of them start automatically either with the previous effect or after .,No
,,,  I 'm going to choose After for everything but the very first animation .,
,,,  That way they 'll all play one after the other a soon a we click the mouse .,
,,,  If you go back to the drop arrow ... and then choose Effect Options from the menu ...,
,,,  you 'll get a dialog box where you can really fine the effect .,
,,,  Some of these option will vary depending on the specific animation you 're working with .,
kw_udjD2xwo9,3.41,4.02,  For example with this animation ... we can set the answer to fade in all at once one,No
,,,  word at a time or one letter at a time .,
,,,  I want a little bit more flair so I 'm going to go ahead and choose by letter .,
,,,  If we go to the Timing tab ... we can adjust thing like the speed of the effect and whether,
,,,  or not it repeat .,
,,,  I 'm going to add a tiny bit of delay to give the audience more time to think of the answer .,
kw_udjD2xwo10,4.1,4.35,  And that look perfect !,No
,,,  Now I 'm going to play the entire slide show so we can see the finished product .,
,,,  We 'll just click the mouse to trigger the first effect ... which trigger the next one,
,,,  automatically ... and then the next one .,
,,,  I really like the way the answer animation turned out so I 'd like to use the same one,
,,,  on the other question slide .,
kw_udjD2xwo12,4.37,5.13,  Luckily we do n't have to go through all the step again?we can just copy and paste the,No
,,,  effect from one object to another .,
,,,  First select the object whose animation you want to copy ... then click the command that,
,,,  say Animation Painter .,
,,,  Next click whatever object you want to add the effect to ... and now it fade in in exactly,
,,,  the same way .,
,,,  We 're well on our way to creating a fun practice quiz .,
,,,  With just a few animation you can turn a simple slide show into something interesting,
,,,  and engaging .,
GGjacTn_9ts1,0.04,0.14,  designing effective visual aid for,No
,,,  presentation it wa n't too long ago,
,,,  when the only people at a place of,
,,,  business who had access to desktop,
,,,  publishing software package with the,
,,,  computer genius and design guru back,
GGjacTn_9ts2,0.17,0.27,  then you had to work side by side with,No
,,,  one of those trained professional in,
,,,  order to design visual aid for a,
,,,  business presentation the software wa,
,,,  expensive difficult to access and tricky,
,,,  to use today all of that ha changed,
GGjacTn_9ts3,0.3,0.41,  with presentation software package like,No
,,,  PowerPoint and Keynote installed on,
,,,  nearly every computer at home and school,
,,,  and in the office we all have easy,
,,,  access to the user product the,
,,,  business community expects it employee,
GGjacTn_9ts4,0.43,0.55,  to be able to utilize the program when,No
,,,  presenting information however just,
,,,  because we have access to the program,
,,,  doe n't mean we all do a good job of,
,,,  using that program well in the hand of,
,,,  the unskilled student the numerous,
GGjacTn_9ts5,0.57,1.07,  gee feature of PowerPoint and,No
,,,  Keynote can result in load of,
,,,  teeny text in hard to read font on,
,,,  top of unprofessional design template,
,,,  and the use of too many piece of,
,,,  generic clipart in this tutorial you,
GGjacTn_9ts6,1.11,1.2,  will be reminded of basic design,No
,,,  technique that will help you avoid the,
,,,  mistake that make you look,
,,,  unprofessional and feel le confident,
,,,  in your presentation before we address,
,,,  basic design tip to consider please,
GGjacTn_9ts7,1.22,1.32,  remember that your message is more,No
,,,  important than the visual do n't spend so,
,,,  much time designing the visual aid that,
,,,  you forget to organize your thought and,
,,,  do proper research on the verbal portion,
,,,  of the presentation a visual aid whether,
GGjacTn_9ts8,1.36,1.49,  it 's PowerPoint a trifold board a prop,No
,,,  or a handout is just that and aid these,
,,,  aid enhance a presentation and should,
,,,  not become the presentation we will,
,,,  first discus the process of deciding,
,,,  what a good visual aid could be and then,
GGjacTn_9ts9,1.52,2.03,  you will consider three aspect of,No
,,,  design what idea need to be highlighted,
,,,  visually for example do I have,
,,,  photograph of the product which piece,
,,,  of the product need to be photographed,
,,,  do I need to take the product apart and,
GGjacTn_9ts10,2.06,2.19,  photograph the piece what statistic,No
,,,  need to be shown what key point do I,
,,,  need to emphasize there 's a pie chart or,
,,,  our chart better emphasize what I need,
,,,  to tell the audience go through each,
,,,  main point of the presentation and make,
GGjacTn_9ts11,2.21,2.32,  a general list of what important item,No
,,,  the audience need to know keep in mind,
,,,  not everything on your list may make the,
,,,  final slide deck while showing the,
,,,  information on the slide enhance or,
,,,  detract from my message what you are,
GGjacTn_9ts12,2.34,2.46,  trying to think about here is keeping,No
,,,  the information on your slide a simple,
,,,  a possible remember the old phrase kiss,
,,,  keep it simple sweetheart that old,
,,,  phrase applies here go back through the,
,,,  list you just made and be critical ask,
GGjacTn_9ts13,2.48,3.02,  yourself if that photo chart or sentence,No
,,,  need to be shown or will it serve a a,
,,,  distraction to the audience how many,
,,,  slide are necessary again keep it,
,,,  simple if you are not required to have a,
,,,  certain number of slide consider this,
GGjacTn_9ts14,3.04,3.15,  you only really need one slide per major,No
,,,  element in the presentation for example,
,,,  one slide during the introduction one,
,,,  slide for each main point that you,
,,,  discus and a final slide for the,
,,,  conclusion keeping the number of slide,
GGjacTn_9ts15,3.17,3.28,  to a minimum keep the focus on you and,Structure
,,,  the key idea of your message once you,
,,,  have determined what would be good to,
,,,  show your audience a you are speaking,
,,,  you need to focus on design while,
,,,  everyone ha a slightly different idea,
GGjacTn_9ts16,3.3,3.42,  of what good design really is there are,No
,,,  three Universal idea that apply to,
,,,  every presentation first consistency,
,,,  choose a template that provides,
,,,  excellent readability a professional,
,,,  color scheme and is appropriate to the,
GGjacTn_9ts17,3.44,3.55,  tone of your message for example a,No
,,,  presentation with the serious tone may,
,,,  utilize dark background color such a,
,,,  black or navy blue while presentation,
,,,  with a light tone may utilize,
,,,  light background color such a green,
GGjacTn_9ts18,3.57,4.11,  and light blue not every template,No
,,,  offered with the PowerPoint and Keynote,
,,,  software fit these characteristic some,
,,,  good example are adjacency clarity,
,,,  Technic and urban these template are,
,,,  clean easy to read and have professional,
GGjacTn_9ts19,4.14,4.27,  color scheme some not so good example,No
,,,  are autumn Couture opulent and verb,
,,,  these design template utilize hard to,
,,,  read background color are extremely,
,,,  busy and are professional in nature,
,,,  whichever template you,
GGjacTn_9ts20,4.28,4.4,  select be consistent with it and utilize,No
,,,  that one template throughout the entire,
,,,  slideshow utilize the same color and,
,,,  font throughout the slideshow selecting,
,,,  one font like Helvetica for the header,
,,,  and another Times New Roman for example,
GGjacTn_9ts21,4.43,4.55,  for the text is acceptable but you,No
,,,  should stick with those in the same,
,,,  order throughout second readability make,
,,,  sure that the design template you select,
,,,  us contrasting color for readability,
,,,  example purple slide not all design,
GGjacTn_9ts22,4.59,5.1,  template use large enough type size and,No
,,,  it 's bullet point any type size le,
,,,  than 28 point type is too small,
,,,  double check your size just throughout,
,,,  the document and if needed manually,
,,,  select a larger type size and make sure,
GGjacTn_9ts23,5.12,5.24,  that your size are consistent if you,No
,,,  have a chance you may want to test it,
,,,  out in a room you will be using stand in,
,,,  the back and see if you can read the,
,,,  text clearly and without squinting not,
,,,  all photograph downloaded from the,
GGjacTn_9ts24,5.25,5.36,  internet appear perfect when inserted,No
,,,  into PowerPoint what look good in a,
,,,  smaller version may become bitmapped or,
,,,  blurry when enlarged on a PowerPoint,
,,,  slide take the time to find a clear,
,,,  photo avoid large complicated chart if,
GGjacTn_9ts25,5.39,5.5,  you need to include such a chart in your,No
,,,  presentation it may be best to hand it,
,,,  out instead of forcing people to squint,
,,,  to determine which slice of a pie chart ',
,,,  go with what color and width what that,
,,,  represents stick to the basic Helvetica,
GGjacTn_9ts26,5.54,6.08,  Calibri Verdana and Arial for heading,No
,,,  and chart label and Times New Roman,
,,,  Bookman Garamond and Palatino for bullet point ,
,,,  most magazine newspaper and,
,,,  book utilize a similar system to ensure,
,,,  readability avoid using all capital,
GGjacTn_9ts27,6.11,6.21,  letter standard capitalization is,No
,,,  easier to read wo n't tire your,
,,,  audience 's eye and your audience wo n't,
,,,  think you are screaming at them the rule,
,,,  of seven still applies we 're needing to,
,,,  utilize a lot of text on a PowerPoint,
GGjacTn_9ts28,6.23,6.35,  slide remember it is best to corral this,No
,,,  text with seven word on a bullet point,
,,,  seven bullet point per slide this,
,,,  force you to think short and simple how,
,,,  do you only have seven word on a bullet,
,,,  point easy do n't use the entire sentence,
GGjacTn_9ts29,6.38,6.5,  use phrase third professional even if,No
,,,  you want,
,,,  design guru there are a few simple,
,,,  trick to think about when designing,
,,,  presentation visuals use clipart or,
,,,  photography that 's relevant to your,
GGjacTn_9ts30,6.51,7.03,  message professional in scope and is,No
,,,  fairly consistent in tone throughout,
,,,  have the clipart or photograph lead,
,,,  to the text employ simple animation,
,,,  scheme throughout here 's where many get,
,,,  in trouble with PowerPoint and Keynote,
GGjacTn_9ts31,7.04,7.16,  both of these software system offer,No
,,,  dozen of way to make the text zoom fly,
,,,  float wipe and spin into a slideshow,
,,,  however these animation are way too,
,,,  distracting,
,,,  yes it is a good idea to utilize a,
GGjacTn_9ts32,7.18,7.29,  simple animation scheme to place one,No
,,,  bullet point or one photo on the screen,
,,,  exactly at the time it is needed it 's a,
,,,  great way to bring attention to one item,
,,,  and the audience doe n't feel compelled,
,,,  to read or look at everything on your,
GGjacTn_9ts33,7.31,7.43,  slide before you actually bring their,No
,,,  attention to it however keep this,
,,,  animation simple using a peer is the,
,,,  simplest way to accomplish this thinking,
,,,  about these three design concept,
,,,  consistency readability and,
,,,  consistency readability and,
GGjacTn_9ts34,7.45,7.57,  professionalism and taking the time to,No
,,,  think about your visual aid can make a,
,,,  huge positive impact on how you are,
,,,  perceived a a presenter however please,
,,,  remember that no amount of fancy slide,
,,,  effect and animation scheme can,
GGjacTn_9ts36,7.59,8.21,  overcome poor preparation if you do n't,No
,,,  do your job in research and organization,
,,,  not even a smartly designed PowerPoint,
,,,  and Keynote will save visit the,
,,,  communication Success Center in room 138,
,,,  of the Fine Arts Center for one,
,,,  assistance and advice in this topic or,
,,,  any other aspect of public speaking,
,,,  you,
MdLMLMzudbM1,0.01,0.12,  mark pen can be used for producing,No
,,,  highly realistic presentation drawing,
,,,  of product but here we 're using them,
,,,  for quickly adding information to our,
,,,  design idea to help convey our thought,
,,,  to a third party,
MdLMLMzudbM2,0.19,0.37,  marker pen come in a big range of,No
,,,  color but they also come in a range of,
,,,  tone here we 're looking at a range of,
,,,  gray tone and you can see that with,
,,,  each pen the gray is a tone darker,
,,,  to understand how marker pen can add,
MdLMLMzudbM3,0.39,0.53,  information to our sketch we need to,No
,,,  think about light and in particular,
,,,  where the light is coming from I 'm using,
,,,  a reasonably light tone to color the top,
,,,  surface of this box you 'll notice that,
,,,  I 'm working quickly and tidying up the,
MdLMLMzudbM4,0.54,1.08,  edge whilst the ink is still wet,No
,,,  I 'm doing the same with the medium tone,
,,,  on the right hand surface suggesting,
,,,  that it 's further or more hidden from,
,,,  the light source than the top surface,
,,,  finally the darker tone on the remaining,
MdLMLMzudbM5,1.11,1.23,  surface show it still further from the,No
,,,  light this add to the three,
,,,  appearance of the box,
,,,  it also suggests that the light source,
,,,  is somewhere above and to the right of,
,,,  the box this exercise is good for,
MdLMLMzudbM6,1.27,1.5,  practicing working within the sketched,No
,,,  line but again I 'm developing this,
,,,  skill a a mean of communication rather,
,,,  than presentation,
,,,  the box that sits on the horizon ha,
,,,  only two face visible and therefore,
MdLMLMzudbM7,1.53,2.06,  only two tone,No
,,,  you can see that the position of the,
,,,  light source is the same for each of the,
,,,  box so the box have a relationship,
,,,  to each other within the space we 're,
,,,  looking up at the box above the,
MdLMLMzudbM8,2.07,3.06,  horizon so we can see two side and a,No
,,,  base on each the base of these will be,
,,,  an even darker taupe since they 're most,
,,,  hidden from the light source,
,,,  is worth practicing the process until it,
,,,  becomes second nature and we 're working,
MdLMLMzudbM9,3.08,3.25,  on the ability to sketch it with pencil,No
,,,  biro pen or marker pen in a relaxed,
,,,  manner that 's economic a good time,
,,,  if we 're preoccupied with perfecting our,
,,,  presentation then are sketching will,
,,,  become slow our source of idea will,
MdLMLMzudbM10,3.28,3.39,  quickly dry up,No
,,,  we choose to add markup and to our,
,,,  sketch is normally to help communicate,
,,,  our thought and make the design,
,,,  feature of our idea easier to,
,,,  understand for the person reading on,
MdLMLMzudbM11,3.4,4.07,  page,No
,,,  moving on it 's worth working with,
,,,  slightly more involved shape here are a,
,,,  collection of hollow box facing in a,
,,,  variety of direction,
,,,  again I 'm working quickly attempting to,
MdLMLMzudbM12,4.1,4.28,  work up to the edge of shape without,No
,,,  going over them but not worrying and,
,,,  Julie if I do,
,,,  trying to fill the whole surface without,
,,,  letting the ink dry hand where it dry,
,,,  and I go over it it becomes a darker,
MdLMLMzudbM13,4.3,4.5,  tape,No
,,,  it can be a good idea to produce a page,
,,,  of shape in two point perspective and,
,,,  to photocopy it several time for,
,,,  practicing with marker pen that would,
,,,  develop more Skills to quickly reduce a,
MdLMLMzudbM14,4.52,5.11,  new page of shape into point,No
,,,  perspective each time here I 'm using,
,,,  darker tone to add shadow to the inside,
,,,  of the box this enables the person,
,,,  who 's reading the page to fully,
,,,  understand the shape more quickly,
MdLMLMzudbM15,5.15,5.36,  practicing this process here will make,No
,,,  it easier when rendering more complex,
,,,  design idea and the placing of the,
,,,  shadow is informed by the position of,
,,,  the light source,
,,,  exactly the same process is used for,
MdLMLMzudbM16,5.38,5.52,  representing curved surface here I 'm,No
,,,  using different tone to give the sense,
,,,  of a cylindrical surface,
,,,  the lightest tone is positioned where,
,,,  the shape is hit by the most light and,
,,,  the darkest tone where the surface is,
MdLMLMzudbM17,5.55,6.2,  least exposed to the light,No
,,,  anybody reading the sketch would have,
,,,  no idea if these were cylinder or tube,
,,,  without the addition of this marker pen,
,,,  which clearly represents them a hollow,
,,,  to reiterate I 'm working quickly here,
MdLMLMzudbM18,6.23,6.44,  because this is a sketch to convey my,No
,,,  thought and idea rather than being a,
,,,  polished and finished presentation,
,,,  drawing,
,,,  since these curved shape are like flat,
,,,  on the surface I 'm seating them on the,
MdLMLMzudbM19,6.46,7.07,  page by creating shadow I 'm using the,No
,,,  same position of the light source that,
,,,  give me the different tone on the,
,,,  curved surface to position them,
,,,  I hope this ha been a useful video,
,,,  please hit like if it ha there 's lot,

,,,  first to see it for up report,
,,,  on progress and to see my other pursuit,
,,,  you can follow me on instagram the,
,,,  product designer maker thanks for,
,,,  watching,
,,,  you,
KBXOzq0OpS01,0,0.17,  okay start with a blank presentation,Structure
,,,  that 's going to open up and give you,
,,,  this automatic setup you do n't want this,
,,,  so click on each of these box and,
,,,  delete them you want to start from,
,,,  scratch next up insert,
KBXOzq0OpS02,0.22,0.4,  your video okay so you 've already,No
,,,  recorded your video you 're going to go,
,,,  and get your video from your computer,
,,,  here 's mine I 'm going to insert it you,
,,,  can put it anywhere you want most people,
,,,  read from left to right so it 's best to,
KBXOzq0OpS03,0.42,0.54,  put it on the left and then you can make,No
,,,  it a big a you want realize that the,
,,,  bigger you make thing the more of the,
,,,  bigger the file is going to be and you,
,,,  want to have a file that you can handle,
,,,  please notice that this video ha it,
KBXOzq0OpS04,0.57,1.09,  control down here and a timer but these,No
,,,  thing you do n't really need to deal,
,,,  with because all you 're going to do is,
,,,  the simplest right now so after you,
,,,  place your video what you want to do is,
,,,  to tell the computer how to handle it so,
KBXOzq0OpS05,1.12,1.27,  we 're going to go juice the video up,No
,,,  here to play back and then choose that,
,,,  it should play back automatically that 's,
,,,  really really important because what,
,,,  that mean is that when you go down here,
,,,  can you click on slide show it start,
KBXOzq0OpS06,1.3,1.43,  automatically all right okay so we get,No
,,,  out of the slide show the next thing we,
,,,  want to do is to put our visuals up here,
,,,  we 'll put them on the right hand side of,
,,,  the screen and so what we want to do,
,,,  again is to insert anything you want but,
KBXOzq0OpS07,1.48,2.02,  I 'm going to just go with simple,Structure
,,,  picture that I 've already saved so I 'm,
,,,  going to choose just part 1 i 'm going to,
,,,  insert it i 'm going to move it around to,
,,,  where I want it to be and then I 'm going,
,,,  to tell it how to come in with this,
KBXOzq0OpS08,2.04,2.21,  video I go up to animation I go over,No
,,,  here I mean I choose how it appears,
,,,  that 's how I wanted to appear then I,
,,,  need to go over here,
,,,  and choose how it 's going to exit it,
,,,  going to just disappear all right notice,
KBXOzq0OpS09,2.25,2.38,  that we 've got number going on here 0,No
,,,  because this start at zero and then,
,,,  first it appears and then did n't then it,
,,,  disappears okay notice i always have up,
,,,  here on click when it come to these,
,,,  element everything must be on click,
KBXOzq0OpS010,2.41,2.57,  because that will allow you to choose a,No
,,,  this video with playing when this come,
,,,  in and when this come out so let 's try,
,,,  it if i go ahead and hear it start and i,
,,,  click again it come in and i click,
,,,  again and it disappears you do that with,
KBXOzq0OpS011,3.01,3.16,  every visual you put in so let me show,No
,,,  you i 'll insert another visual I 'll take,
,,,  a picture,
,,,  and,
,,,  and insert it and I will sort it out,
,,,  right notice I 'm putting it right on top,
KBXOzq0OpS012,3.18,3.34,  of the other one that 's fine because the,No
,,,  other one will have disappeared then I,
,,,  go up to animation and I choose how,
,,,  it 's going to up here and then I choose,
,,,  how it 's going to disappear and I make,
,,,  sure that everything is on click I never,
KBXOzq0OpS013,3.36,3.58,  change this ok and I 'll do one more I 'm,No
,,,  going to go up here insert the picture,
,,,  move it to where I want it to go and,
,,,  then choose the animation I 'm going to,
,,,  make it just appear i 'm also going to,
,,,  add so that i can make it disappear,
KBXOzq0OpS014,4.02,4.16,  everything is going to be on click if i,No
,,,  can move I can move these around a,
,,,  little bit so you can see the order all,
,,,  right now this is the simplest simplest,
,,,  way to do it look there 's lot of other,
,,,  way you can do it but I 'm showing you,
KBXOzq0OpS015,4.18,4.34,  just a very simplest so I split these up,No
,,,  a little bit so you can see 0 1 2 3 4 5,
,,,  6 this is when it enters this is what an,
,,,  exit this is when it enters this is when,
,,,  it exit and so on ok so let 's see how,
,,,  that work again I start the slideshow,
KBXOzq0OpS016,4.38,4.55,  he start to be king automatically I,No
,,,  click and I get the first one to come up,
,,,  I click again and it disappears I click,
,,,  on the second one come up,
,,,  disappears I click the third one and it,
,,,  come up I click again and it disappears,
KBXOzq0OpS018,4.58,5.23,  okay that 's the simple way to do it,No
,,,  realize that if you just got one you,
,,,  just want to have one visual to the,
,,,  right of the speaker you just put these,
,,,  right on top of each other all right it,
,,,  doe n't matter whether you can see them,
,,,  in the right order or not the computer,
,,,  know what the order is you can get more,
,,,  laughter from here but this is the basic,
,,,  way to do this good luck,
i2of4_ZnqS81,0.05,0.21,  Hello I 'm Callie .,No
,,,  What 's the fastest way to tell the difference between a speech and a presentation ?,
,,,  It 's audio .,
,,,  Today we 'll talk about the importance of visual aid .,
,,,  Thanks for visiting Toastmasters International .,
,,,  Since 1924 we 've helped more than 4 million people gain the confidence to communicate,
i2of4_ZnqS82,0.27,0.5,  in all circumstance .,No
,,,  One of the most demanding situation you 'll ever face is speaking to an audience .,
,,,  This video is part of a series of Toastmasters ' time tip that will help you become,
,,,  a more confident speaker .,
,,,  In this video we 'll explore simple and effective way to make the most of visual aid .,
,,,  Let 's begin with a few simple way to add flare to your next speech by incorporating,
i2of4_ZnqS83,0.56,1.21,  visual aid .,No
,,,  When presenting for business the most commonly tool are a computer and projector and with,
,,,  the help of presentation software image can be projected in sequence on a large screen,
,,,  that even people in the back of the room can easily see .,
,,,  Additionally presentation software make it easier for you to include a short video ;,
,,,  however keep in mind that when you play a video that ha audio you 'll need to have a,
i2of4_ZnqS84,1.26,1.45,  pair of external speaker .,No
,,,  Most built laptop speaker lack the power needed to increase volume so everyone in the,
,,,  room can hear .,
,,,  Another important tool is the remote control .,
,,,  This wireless handheld device allows you to advance your presentation without having to,
,,,  step over the laptop every time you want to advance to the next slide or picture .,
i2of4_ZnqS85,1.51,2.08,  Projecting an image on the screen can help the audience visually grasp your point and,No
,,,  a prop can add an extra dimension to your presentation .,
,,,  Visual aid are a great way to keep the audience interested .,
,,,  When you want to brainstorm with the audience get back to basic by incorporating a flip,
,,,  chart or white board .,
,,,  For this type of exercise there is no better tool .,
i2of4_ZnqS86,2.12,2.33,  On the spot you can grab your listener idea and jot them down .,No
,,,  The rapid exchange is fun and the audience feel more invested in the experience by seeing,
,,,  their word and idea come to life before them .,
,,,  Now that we 've identified the key support tool let 's take a look at we can effectively,
,,,  interact with visual aid .,
,,,  If you plan to present with a slide deck you have to prepare for Murphy 's Law .,
i2of4_ZnqS87,2.38,2.58,  `` Who is Murphy and what 's his law ? '' you ask .,No
,,,  It 's the idea that if anything can go wrong it will .,
,,,  In preparation be ready for technical glitch by printing up a backup copy of your presentation,
,,,  slide .,
,,,  No matter what happens to the audio or video equipment you 'll be fully prepared to stand,
,,,  and deliver because you have your printed slide and talking point with you .,
i2of4_ZnqS88,3.04,3.24,  When it come to setting up your visual aid arrive early to the venue to position your,No
,,,  material in the best location .,
,,,  If you 're working with a computer test it to be sure you can see your presentation deck,
,,,  on the screen .,
,,,  Honoring Murphy 's Law always carry a backup copy of your slide deck on a USB drive to,
,,,  remedy possible technical problem that may arise .,
i2of4_ZnqS89,3.29,3.5,  Be aware that presenting with visual aid can be troublesome .,No
,,,  For instance telling a story about a bear when you have a picture of a rowboat on the,
,,,  screen can confuse the audience .,
,,,  Always remember that the image on the screen must relate to the story you 're sharing in,
,,,  order for your story and you to have credibility .,
,,,  Similarly do n't feel tempted to use video just because it 's an option .,
i2of4_ZnqS810,3.56,4.17,  A frivolous video that doe n't support your message is a distraction .,No
,,,  So choose video that will reinforce your point .,
,,,  While slide can help you stay on track they also create another challenge they increase,
,,,  the number of spoken transition in your presentation .,
,,,  Every time you click on the next slide you 'll need to verbally take the audience from one,
,,,  slide idea to the next to make the story feel seamless and fluid .,
i2of4_ZnqS811,4.23,4.48,  And last but not least it 's time to concentrate on the final consideration : the you factor .,No
,,,  The most prominent visual aid in the front of the room is you .,
,,,  And that 's why it 's crucial that you pay close attention to your personal style .,
,,,  Are the clothes you are wearing in line with your message ?,
,,,  If you 're ever in doubt with how to dress follow this simple rule : raise your style,
,,,  one level higher than the audience 's .,
i2of4_ZnqS813,4.51,5.27,  For instance if they 're dressed casually then dress in line with business casual style .,No
,,,  The way we move physically also play a part in our visual credibility .,
,,,  Avoid moving too much or too little because both can be distracting .,
,,,  Pay special attention that your gesture and movement support your story .,
,,,  Incorporate these tip and technique and before you know it you 'll have mastered the,
,,,  art of making the most of visual aid .,
,,,  For more information on making the most of visual aid visit a Toastmasters club .,
,,,  Find a location near you at toastmasters.org .,
4pymfPHQ6SA1,0.04,0.17,  what if I told you that the world,Structure
,,,  creates 2.5 quintillion byte of data,
,,,  every single day would you believe me,
,,,  what if I told you that 90 % of all data,
,,,  ever created in the history of the world,
,,,  sprouted in just the past two year do,
4pymfPHQ6SA2,0.2,0.31,  you believe me yet well hold on your,No
,,,  brain folk because both are very very,
,,,  true whether it 's the 13 new spotify,
,,,  song or the 600 Wikipedia page edits,
,,,  maybe the five hundred and twenty seven,
,,,  thousand snapchats or how about sixty,
4pymfPHQ6SA3,0.34,0.45,  million text all of this data is,No
,,,  created no not just in a day in 60,
,,,  second which is why we want to let the,
,,,  data scientist decipher this,
,,,  never feed of information but it,
,,,  is important for all of u to know how,
4pymfPHQ6SA4,0.47,0.55,  to present this information in a,No
,,,  visually appealing way that 's why I 'm,
,,,  here,
,,,  hello world my name is Mike plugger here,
,,,  with viz me and I 'm here to show you how,
,,,  you can create data that appeal to your,
4pymfPHQ6SA5,0.57,1.09,  viewer but also how to create data that,No
,,,  tell a story let 's get started before,
,,,  we begin if you 're interested in how our,
,,,  brain decipher all of this information,
,,,  check out this video by visibly falender,
,,,  payment ie about the science behind how,
4pymfPHQ6SA6,1.11,1.25,  we perceive object believe it or not,No
,,,  our vision is much more complicated than,
,,,  you may have ever thought but payment,
,,,  simplifies it with a handful of helpful,
,,,  visuals,
,,,  when it come to a specific image there,
4pymfPHQ6SA7,1.28,1.39,  are two thing that our brain,No
,,,  immediately notice contrast and pattern,
,,,  take a look at our very first image at,
,,,  first glance you can only decipher a,
,,,  tree landscape that 's because there is,
,,,  absolutely no contrast in this all,
4pymfPHQ6SA8,1.42,1.54,  image but a you start to add in more,No
,,,  contrast with purple and yellow you may,
,,,  notice that now there 's a bear that wa,
,,,  there that you could n't see before but,
,,,  it 's hard to have any more contrast than,
,,,  with black and white and this final,
4pymfPHQ6SA9,1.56,2.11,  image that bear popping off of the page,No
,,,  this just go to show that our brain,
,,,  are better at identifying color rather,
,,,  than shape through what is called,
,,,  pre processing our brain are,
,,,  constantly gathering information from,
4pymfPHQ6SA10,2.13,2.24,  our environment because of this it 's,No
,,,  easier to detect the difference around,
,,,  u that is especially noticeable in,
,,,  pattern we just talked about contrast,
,,,  so in this very first pattern our brain,
,,,  immediately notice that darker rectangle,
4pymfPHQ6SA11,2.27,2.37,  in the lower left if you take away the,No
,,,  contrast when you make one rectangle,
,,,  with just a little bit larger it still,
,,,  stand out immediately,
,,,  lastly you take that one rectangle that,
,,,  wa a little bit larger and even flip it,
4pymfPHQ6SA12,2.39,2.54,  vertically it still stand out among the,No
,,,  rest of it rectangle friend this is,
,,,  our brain working for u,
,,,  now that we 've established how our,
,,,  brain see image let 's dive into,
,,,  applying this knowledge with creating,
4pymfPHQ6SA13,2.55,3.1,  some effective data visualization first,No
,,,  different from reading text our eye,
,,,  do n't follow a specific order and,
,,,  reading a chart or a graph our eye,
,,,  do n't go from left to right or from up,
,,,  to down when reading a graph or a chart,
4pymfPHQ6SA14,3.12,3.23,  a you can see here our eye kind of go,No
,,,  really,
,,,  wherever the pace when looking at a,
,,,  graph our chart is also very different,
,,,  we may just glance at one part of the,
,,,  image while glaring at another this is,
4pymfPHQ6SA15,3.25,3.38,  why it 's so difficult to create a,No
,,,  graphic that take u on a predefined,
,,,  visual journey when we look at a graph,
,,,  our eye are immediately directed to,
,,,  what stand out it all go back to the,
,,,  pattern that we had just discussed but,
4pymfPHQ6SA16,3.4,3.51,  there should just be one main focal,No
,,,  point to your image in this graph our,
,,,  eye are immediately directed to that,
,,,  steep climb and peak on the right side,
,,,  of the graph and after we see the title,
,,,  we immediately understand that the u.s .,
4pymfPHQ6SA17,3.54,4.09,  incarceration rate ha jumped greatly,No
,,,  beginning in the 1970s the best data,
,,,  storyteller will only have one clear,
,,,  message that is effortlessly understood,
,,,  this graph here did a great job of that,
,,,  when there are more than five variable,
4pymfPHQ6SA18,4.11,4.23,  present our eye perceive all of them a,No
,,,  one single hole this is another reason,
,,,  to simplify your chart and only,
,,,  highlight one single point this graph,
,,,  here is an example of what not to do you,
,,,  notice the word outage the gray,
4pymfPHQ6SA19,4.25,4.36,  background spike and even at that Green,No
,,,  Line going throughout the graph but,
,,,  what 's the message a lot of unnecessary,
,,,  time and effort is spent in to,
,,,  deciphering what this chart is telling,
,,,  me after some time you can probably,
4pymfPHQ6SA20,4.38,4.49,  figure it out but it would be much more,Structure
,,,  effective if you got rid of that gray,
,,,  background area and told u the call,
,,,  received and simply focused on the,
,,,  rating before and after the outage,
4pymfPHQ6SA21,4.52,5.03,  remember and I will continue to,No
,,,  emphasize this our brain recognize,
,,,  pattern and in pattern we find,
,,,  connection here the brain assumes the,
,,,  connection between the color orange and,
,,,  top performer and also the orange data,
4pymfPHQ6SA22,5.05,5.15,  point,No
,,,  this need u to think that the orange,
,,,  data point are the top performer but,
,,,  that 's not the case this is another,
,,,  poorly executed chart the top performer,
,,,  are actually all those data point in,
4pymfPHQ6SA23,5.17,5.32,  the top right which if you look at it,No
,,,  seems to be mostly the blue data point,
,,,  if you 're using more than one color you,
,,,  want to assign deliberately which did n't,
,,,  happen here from the time we 're born,
,,,  we 're influenced by cultural convention,
4pymfPHQ6SA24,5.34,5.45,  what are these exactly well for example,No
,,,  time is right on a line from left to,
,,,  right or with color red mean hot and,
,,,  blue mean cold the same can even be,
,,,  said with image a scale and FERS,
,,,  balance or comparison between two,
4pymfPHQ6SA25,5.47,5.56,  different thing,No
,,,  if these convention are ignored our,
,,,  visuals will become much more difficult,
,,,  to understand this chart is nearly,
,,,  identical to the one that we found back,
,,,  in tip 3 but time is placed on the,
4pymfPHQ6SA26,5.59,6.17,  y say time is read on a line from,Structure
,,,  left to right a we just said this is,
,,,  much more confusing and much le,
,,,  effective keep time on the x trust,
,,,  me,
,,,  now this video is n't just about,
4pymfPHQ6SA27,6.19,6.29,  improving your chart the whole reason,Structure
,,,  we 're here is to help your chart tell a,
,,,  story so let 's show you some,
,,,  before example to help you,
,,,  create some fresh idea on how to create,
,,,  that next effective storytelling chart,
4pymfPHQ6SA28,6.32,6.42,  if you want to look at the number of,No
,,,  ticket received versus the number of,
,,,  ticket processed in a year this chart,
,,,  is n't too difficult to read but is it,
,,,  telling the story for the reason of,
,,,  decline no no it 's not it come the,
4pymfPHQ6SA29,6.45,6.57,  after chart where you can clearly see,No
,,,  the decline in ticket processed there 's,
,,,  also a lot more room for text which will,
,,,  help explain the story to employee quit,
,,,  that 's your reason for decline so if I 'm,
,,,  the bos this is a very very easy,
4pymfPHQ6SA30,6.59,7.14,  decision hire two more employee pronto,No
,,,  in our next example we have a lot of,
,,,  room for text but pie chart are n't,
,,,  always the best solution especially for,
,,,  the data that we have here the use of,
,,,  one single bar chart make the info a,
4pymfPHQ6SA31,7.16,7.3,  lot more clear more child were,No
,,,  interested in science,
,,,  after the program or before they thought,
,,,  science wa just okay once again we have,
,,,  an ineffective and confusing sharp it 's,
,,,  not clarifying the change in average,
4pymfPHQ6SA32,7.32,7.43,  price per product over time the reader,No
,,,  is forced to go back and forth from the,
,,,  legend to the bar the legend to the,
,,,  bar but in the second chart the line,
,,,  are labeled properly so there is no back,
,,,  and forth you can see that the trend for,
4pymfPHQ6SA33,7.45,7.58,  each product is recognizable at the very,No
,,,  first glance in any case that you want,
,,,  to show the change over time a line,
,,,  graph is probably your best option I,
,,,  like to think of it a time line maybe,
,,,  that 's just me,
4pymfPHQ6SA34,7.59,8.13,  but maybe it could also help you to,No
,,,  last but not least our final before,
,,,  chart seems pretty easy to read however,
,,,  the convention that we 've learned and,
,,,  discussed earlier are not applied,
,,,  properly the level of interest is n't,
4pymfPHQ6SA35,8.15,8.25,  organized in the sending order we 're,Structure
,,,  here in the second chart the reader,
,,,  understands who 's the most interested,
,,,  versus who 's the least interested in,
,,,  that correct order through color and,
,,,  order via a scale the difference in,
4pymfPHQ6SA36,8.28,8.38,  value are more distinguishable now that,No
,,,  you 've learned the principle for a,
,,,  persuasive data storytelling create your,
,,,  next chart on viz meas website there 's a,
,,,  chart an infographic tool that is,
,,,  completely free and there 's a wide,
4pymfPHQ6SA38,8.39,8.54,  variety of other visual communication,No
,,,  tool at your disposal also make sure,
,,,  you subscribe to our channel for,

S3tuT0yimfM1,0.05,0.2,  Designing effective visual aid : so you need to make some visual aid to,No
,,,  enhance your presentation,
,,,  after you have planned your content it 's time to think about how you will present,
,,,  it,
,,,  first decide which software to use,
,,,  most student use PowerPoint but there are other option such a prezi,
S3tuT0yimfM2,0.25,0.4,  and you can consider that,No
,,,  this video us PowerPoint but the same idea can be used in prezis or other,

,,,  OK when it come to designing your PowerPoint,
,,,  there are some main point to keep in mind,
,,,  you should start with choosing a background and font,
S3tuT0yimfM3,0.43,0.56,  it 's better to avoid using bright colour a they can not only be distracting but,No
,,,  also difficult to see from a distance,
,,,  instead,
,,,  choose a light background with dark simple font,
,,,  or a dark background,
,,,  with a light font,
S3tuT0yimfM4,1,1.16,  you should use a minimum of at least size 28 font,No
,,,  remember that the person in the back of the room ha to be able to see the text,
,,,  a well,
,,,  also in a group presentation,
,,,  you should have a consistent design for all slide,
,,,  the next thing to consider is the text itself,
S3tuT0yimfM5,1.19,1.36,  do n't overload the slide with too many detail,No
,,,  writing lot of information in a PowerPoint presentation can be,
,,,  distracting and frustrating for the audience,
,,,  within second of your presentation starting you are likely to lose the,
,,,  audience 's attention,
,,,  they wo n't be listening to you,
S3tuT0yimfM6,1.38,1.52,  they 'll be trying to read all the information on the slide,No
,,,  keep in mind,
,,,  the PowerPoint should only guide your speaking not replace it,
,,,  instead,
,,,  choose only key point to highlight your information,
,,,  you should not write in full sentence or paragraph,
S3tuT0yimfM7,1.55,2.11,  instead,No
,,,  choose key point and write them in bullet point,
,,,  three to five bullet point on each slide will do,
,,,  use noun phrase and parallel structure,
,,,  this make your point far more effective,
,,,  PowerPoints are more interesting to your audience if you include image such,
S3tuT0yimfM8,2.14,2.33,  a picture chart and graph,No
,,,  but do n't overdo it,
,,,  use chart and graph to illustrate data and fact,
,,,  people are more likely to remember and understand the information in that form,
,,,  rather than listing number in a table,
,,,  picture are always effective and can help explain complex concept but use,
S3tuT0yimfM9,2.37,2.49,  them sparingly,No
,,,  choose appropriate picture and remember that you need to have permission to use,
,,,  them,
,,,  all picture,
,,,  should show the source,
,,,  another thing to consider when creating a PowerPoint,
S3tuT0yimfM10,2.52,3.09,  is limiting the use of special effect and graphic a they can be quite,No
,,,  distracting,
,,,  the audience is there to hear what you have to say,
,,,  not to look at your PowerPoint slide,
,,,  remember in academic presentation you need to provide in reference on,
,,,  slide,
S3tuT0yimfM12,3.09,3.4,  when you 're citing other source,No
,,,  and then you need to provide a reference list on your final slide,
,,,  use the right referencing system for your subject,
,,,  APA,
,,,  or IEEE for example,
,,,  you can even create a QR code at the end of your presentation,
,,,  a a way to distribute your reference list to the audience,
,,,  finally,
,,,  make sure that your language is correct,
,,,  proofread the slide for any overlooked spelling and grammatical error,
,,,  all right that 's it from me start designing your visual aid,
RJCp-ttFpd41,0,0.16,  one way to make your presentation more,No
,,,  impactful is to use some key idea and,
,,,  principle from the realm of graphic,
,,,  design first let 's start with a typical,
,,,  slide what do you think and perhaps more,
,,,  importantly what will your audience take,
RJCp-ttFpd42,0.19,0.32,  yes that 's probably a pretty common form,No
,,,  but not specifically what 's wrong with,
,,,  it other than the obvious,
,,,  well the solid white background can be,
,,,  really harsh most of the time there 's,
,,,  copious amount of text in the bullet,
RJCp-ttFpd43,0.34,0.47,  point really oh and anything other than,No
,,,  sleep boredom and let 's not,
,,,  forget the worst offender of all yep,
,,,  this is not a great slide but fear not,
,,,  loyal follower there is a better way,
,,,  let me talk you through sweet easy step,
RJCp-ttFpd44,0.5,1.04,  to creating slide that make your,No
,,,  audience a WoW instead of number one,
,,,  start on the back in the background a,
,,,  white background on the slide can be,
,,,  really harsh and often look unfinished,
,,,  rather than thought so unless you 're,
RJCp-ttFpd45,1.06,1.17,  a really good graphic designer that can,No
,,,  make it work it 's not what we recommend,
,,,  an easy way to improve the slide,
,,,  background is that add a picture be sure,
,,,  to use Creative Commons image or buy,
,,,  from a stock image website just make,
RJCp-ttFpd46,1.19,1.3,  sure you do n't choose a really busy,No
,,,  image a all often be distracting for,
,,,  your audience instead something nice and,
,,,  clean and in keeping with your plan if,
,,,  you want to take thing to the next,
,,,  level try this hack duplicate your image,
RJCp-ttFpd47,1.33,1.46,  and put one on top of the other using,No
,,,  the alignment tool go to artistic,
,,,  aspect choose blur and your image will,
,,,  will blur into the background like it,
,,,  ha a soft focus and if you then add a,
,,,  fade entrance animation and put the,
RJCp-ttFpd48,1.48,1.59,  timing on after previous then when you,No
,,,  come to your slide you start off with a,
,,,  crisp image which blend into the,
,,,  background nice and smoothly and reduces,
,,,  any risk of distraction,
,,,  hmm classy okay next up the logically,
RJCp-ttFpd49,2.05,2.22,  named step to this time bullet point,Structure
,,,  what do you think of bullet point,
,,,  precisely what a point do n't work too,
,,,  much text all at once mean the audience,
,,,  are just reading ahead and ignoring the,
,,,  print job one cut it down to the minimum,
RJCp-ttFpd410,2.25,2.37,  text you need to convey the idea make,No
,,,  each point it own text box so that it,
,,,  stand out clearly from the others but,
,,,  do n't let the text be cramped into each,
,,,  box instead give your text some,
,,,  breathing space viola increasing the,
RJCp-ttFpd411,2.38,2.5,  size of the box or reducing the point,No
,,,  size of the text but make sure it can be,
,,,  easily read make sure that all the box,
,,,  are the same size to next align,
,,,  everything and distribute the box,
,,,  evenly so that it 's all neatly laid out,
RJCp-ttFpd412,2.52,3.05,  go to the Home tab and arrange to these,No
,,,  and use a fly entrance animation I,
,,,  deal with each box in a click to focus,
,,,  your audience on the relevant content an,
,,,  advanced trick to bring even more,
,,,  sophistication is to adjust the,
RJCp-ttFpd413,3.07,3.2,  transparency of the text box by right,No
,,,  clicking tuning format shape then fill,
,,,  and drag the transparency slider about,
,,,  25 % is good that way your background,
,,,  image Peaks through bringing depth to,
,,,  the slide content but keeping the text,
RJCp-ttFpd414,3.22,3.36,  legible uh I think I 'd have to agree,No
,,,  with that,
,,,  thing are really hotting up now in the,
,,,  final step in which we 'll tackle that,
,,,  pesky clip up remember kid when it,
,,,  come to clipart just say no clipart,
RJCp-ttFpd415,3.4,3.52,  give your slide all the sophistication,No
,,,  of a child 's IT project is that the,
,,,  impression you want to give people,
,,,  probably not instead get yourself a set,
,,,  icon stock image website the great,
,,,  service it 's definitely an investment,
RJCp-ttFpd416,3.54,4.07,  icon provide an easy,No
,,,  visual language for your audience,
,,,  once you have your icon pop them into a,
,,,  box the same height is your point then,
,,,  copy the formatting of your point to,
,,,  your new box by using the soft copy,
RJCp-ttFpd417,4.09,4.23,  shortcut of ctrl + Shift + C to copy the,No
,,,  formatting from the text box and then,
,,,  ctrl + Shift + V to paste the formatting,
,,,  to the icon the final step is to group,
,,,  the electron and box together the,
,,,  keyboard shortcut is ctrl + G and then,
RJCp-ttFpd418,4.25,4.38,  add a room animation to each icon group,No
,,,  set the timing to with previous and in,
,,,  the animation pane drag each animation,
,,,  next to the corresponding text box,
,,,  animation okay it 's time for the big,
,,,  reveal,
RJCp-ttFpd420,4.39,5.09,  one of the freak of these three easy,No
,,,  step now remember what we started with,
,,,  rule exactly that slide doe not pas,
,,,  the test but now cover much neater,
,,,  slicker and more proficient and how do,
,,,  you think your audience is going to,
,,,  react to this kind of slide probably so,
,,,  give it a go three simple step to,
,,,  create much better slice that generates,
,,,  a much better reaction,
,,,  seriously go do it now now,
VCr7ZXNKz6A1,0.14,0.32,  hello I 'm Liz bank from skill studio,Structure
,,,  and I 'm going to give you some helpful,
,,,  tip on how to do well in your next job,
,,,  interview if you get invited back for a,
,,,  second interview you may have to deliver,
,,,  a presentation so let 's look at a few,
VCr7ZXNKz6A2,0.35,0.52,  key point that you need to bear in mind,Structure
,,,  number one know your audience,
,,,  create a profile on the interviewer or,
,,,  interview panel to find out a much you,
,,,  can beforehand for example number on the,
,,,  panel level the responsibility or level,
VCr7ZXNKz6A3,0.55,1.11,  of expertise any other specialist,Structure
,,,  knowledge do they know you or each other,
,,,  this will help determine the material,
,,,  example and the amount of detail you,
,,,  can use in your presentation number two,
,,,  one key message there should only be one,
VCr7ZXNKz6A4,1.16,1.29,  key message in your presentation which,Structure
,,,  act like the spinal cord to the,
,,,  presentation and hold everything else,
,,,  together summarize this in one powerful,
,,,  sentence and keep it foremost in your,
,,,  mind throughout the presentation number,
VCr7ZXNKz6A5,1.33,1.48,  three the power of three restrict your,Structure
,,,  presentation to three main section this,
,,,  help to keep a strong focus to your,
,,,  presentation three tends to be the magic,
,,,  number that people remember thing in,
,,,  more than this and you will start to,
VCr7ZXNKz6A6,1.51,2.08,  lose clarity in the presentation each,Structure
,,,  main section is like a mini presentation,
,,,  it should have a beginning middle and,
,,,  end this make it easier to follow and,
,,,  help the audience remember the message,
,,,  it 's really important that you make a,
VCr7ZXNKz6A7,2.1,2.22,  strong opening at the start of your,Structure
,,,  presentation it 's the time we want to,
,,,  grab or D & C tension a many way of,
,,,  doing this for example you might start,
,,,  with a question or a quote or an,
,,,  important fact to actually arouse in,
VCr7ZXNKz6A8,2.25,2.36,  it 's also very important that your,No
,,,  opening is six synced and clear this,
,,,  will set the tone for the rest of the,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  learn it off by heart practice your,
,,,  opening in the mirror many time so that,
VCr7ZXNKz6A9,2.39,2.52,  it really becomes part of you this will,No
,,,  give you an added confidence when you,
,,,  begin your presentation and it will help,
,,,  you to avoid the classic UNH 's Anders,
,,,  that are very common when people are,
,,,  nervous and hesitant when you practice,
VCr7ZXNKz6A10,2.55,3.12,  in the mirror smile at yourself and see,No
,,,  how it feel quite often you will need,
,,,  to use a visual aid this may be a flip,
,,,  chart or an OHP but most commonly it is,
,,,  PowerPoint address the interview panel,
,,,  at the start of the presentation before,
VCr7ZXNKz6A11,3.14,3.25,  starting the slideshow this will help,No
,,,  you to build rapport with the panel to,
,,,  start and will also get the impression,
,,,  that it is you who is controlling the,
,,,  presentation rather than the PowerPoint,
,,,  controlling you take your time to change,
VCr7ZXNKz6A12,3.29,3.42,  slide pause and allow the panel to take,No
,,,  in what is on the screen before speaking,
,,,  they need time to assimilate what ha,
,,,  just been said and to absorb the,
,,,  information on the new slide before you,
,,,  start to speak it will also give you,
VCr7ZXNKz6A13,3.45,4,  time to gather your thought before you,No
,,,  begin to speak,
,,,  remember to direct your delivery to the,
,,,  panel not the screen a voice referring,
,,,  back to the screen for prompt if you do,
,,,  this your voice will trail off a you,
VCr7ZXNKz6A14,4.02,4.16,  turn your head away from the audience,No
,,,  and this will reduce the impact of your,
,,,  message instead use your laptop arrange,
,,,  carefully in front of you or use note,
,,,  or prompt card to give you the,
,,,  necessary prompt finally ensure you,
VCr7ZXNKz6A15,4.2,4.35,  have tested the equipment before the,Structure
,,,  presentation so that you are not thrown,
,,,  by any technical hitch that might,
,,,  occur finally it 's important to have a,
,,,  memorable ending a good ending leave the,
,,,  audience with a final thought to ponder,
VCr7ZXNKz6A17,4.37,4.58,  on,Structure
,,,  this may be through a quote a question,
,,,  to the audience or a provocative,
,,,  statement and when you finish remember,
,,,  be prepared to take question I hope you,
,,,  found this advice useful for more hint,
,,,  and tip just click on Monster Co UK and,
,,,  good luck with your next job interview,
P4zxWqC_fCY1,0,0.11,  what do we understand by presentation,No
,,,  skill why,
,,,  presentation skill are so important,
,,,  first myth whenever i ask what is,
,,,  presentation skill,
,,,  generally the present generation student,
P4zxWqC_fCY2,0.13,0.25,  they believe,Structure
,,,  there ha to be a power point if you,
,,,  think that is presentation,
,,,  you are wrong presentation mean,
,,,  any idea any information that is there,
,,,  in your mind when you want to share it,
P4zxWqC_fCY3,0.27,0.36,  with others,No
,,,  when you are speaking about it when you,
,,,  are communicating,
,,,  with others related to your thought,
,,,  idea,
,,,  that is called a presentation now there,
P4zxWqC_fCY4,0.38,0.52,  can be different,No
,,,  way of presentation sometimes you may,
,,,  use certain aid certain tool,
,,,  certain technique in order to create,
,,,  not only your presentation but also to,
,,,  present your presentation,
P4zxWqC_fCY5,0.54,1.07,  what i 'm trying to say is please keep in,No
,,,  your mind,
,,,  whatever you speak and communicate,
,,,  in fact that is presentation,
,,,  in order to connect the audience in,
,,,  order to,
P4zxWqC_fCY6,1.08,1.2,  attract the audience in order to grab,No
,,,  the attention of the audience,
,,,  through different aid are just,
,,,  acting a assistance to your,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  so if somebody say that you should be,
P4zxWqC_fCY7,1.22,1.35,  good at presentation,No
,,,  what are they saying they are talking,
,,,  about you having strong,
,,,  command on three c 's one,
,,,  communication second confidence,
,,,  and three content i repeat,
P4zxWqC_fCY8,1.38,1.47,  the three c 's that are very important,No
,,,  whenever,
,,,  we talk about presentation skill the,
,,,  first is,
,,,  communication you all should be good,
,,,  communicator,
P4zxWqC_fCY9,1.49,1.58,  second you should be great at your,No
,,,  confidence level,
,,,  and third the content that you want to,
,,,  deliver,
,,,  should be well prepared well drafted by,
,,,  you one,
P4zxWqC_fCY10,1.59,2.1,  if you fail to draft if you fail to,Structure
,,,  create,
,,,  if you fail to grab the attention of the,
,,,  audience,
,,,  with your communication you can not be a,
,,,  good presentator,
P4zxWqC_fCY11,2.11,2.2,  so whenever we talk about presentation,No
,,,  skill,
,,,  these are the common thing that you,
,,,  have to keep in your mind,
,,,  the main purpose remains these three,
,,,  either we want to inform,
P4zxWqC_fCY12,2.22,2.34,  or we want to persuade or we want to,Structure
,,,  educate,
,,,  now information that is shared is again,
,,,  part of presentation,
,,,  when you are requesting others to act in,
,,,  your,
P4zxWqC_fCY13,2.34,2.44,  way or in your form or when you want,No
,,,  others to act according to your term,
,,,  and condition,
,,,  that is called a first weight your,
,,,  parent,
,,,  they might have persuaded you many time,
P4zxWqC_fCY14,2.48,2.58,  a a child you might have persuaded your,No
,,,  parent,
,,,  many a time a a friend you persuade,
,,,  your friend many time,
,,,  your friend say let u go and watch,
,,,  some,
P4zxWqC_fCY15,2.59,3.12,  movie in one of the theater the hero of,No
,,,  that particular movie,
,,,  you do not like the actor who is,
,,,  casted in that particular movie you do,
,,,  not like him or her,
,,,  so what are you going to do instead of,
P4zxWqC_fCY16,3.15,3.24,  saying yes,No
,,,  you may persuade him to watch some other,
,,,  movie,
,,,  of your interest or choice so i hope i,
,,,  cleared your doubt related to the word,
,,,  persuade,
P4zxWqC_fCY17,3.25,3.34,  persuasion is again very very important,No
,,,  because whenever we talk about sharing,
,,,  our new idea,
,,,  if you talk about proposal writing if,
,,,  you talk about,
,,,  agenda if you talk about group,
P4zxWqC_fCY18,3.36,3.47,  discussion whenever you are,No
,,,  conveying people whenever you are,
,,,  sharing some information to the people,
,,,  you have to persuade them if you fail in,
,,,  persuasion,
,,,  people will reject if you are,
P4zxWqC_fCY19,3.5,4,  successful in persuasion people will,Structure
,,,  accept your proposal,
,,,  they 'll agree to your point and in the,
,,,  group discussion,
,,,  you will be in win situation so keep,
,,,  this in your mind,
P4zxWqC_fCY20,4.01,4.14,  whenever we talk about presentation,No
,,,  presentation talk about,
,,,  three important purpose that can be,
,,,  delivered that can be successfully,
,,,  informed persuaded or educated with the,
,,,  help of presentation,
P4zxWqC_fCY21,4.16,4.28,  so always remember right now if you are,No
,,,  viewing this particular class in order,
,,,  to connect,
,,,  my student in order to grab the,
,,,  attention of my student in order to see,
,,,  that my student are fixed,
P4zxWqC_fCY22,4.29,4.43,  to their screen i 'm using a tomb,No
,,,  i 'm sharing the slide and i 'm pinning it,
,,,  up,
,,,  so that everybody is viewing,
,,,  the same slide i 'm hooking or i 'm,
,,,  anchoring your,
P4zxWqC_fCY23,4.44,4.56,  thought with the slide that i 'm,No
,,,  presenting,
,,,  this is a part or a tool or assistance,
,,,  that i get with the help of technology,
,,,  but what is my presentation,
,,,  my presentation is my speech that i,
P4zxWqC_fCY24,4.58,5.07,  convey to you all,Structure
,,,  the information that i share with you,
,,,  all to persuade,
,,,  to make you all understand what are the,
,,,  important thing that you have to keep in,
,,,  your mind if you really want to have,
P4zxWqC_fCY25,5.09,5.21,  great command on your communication so,No
,,,  keep this in your mind,
,,,  the three purpose with with which you,
,,,  can definitely get,
,,,  or you can deliver a good presentation,
,,,  the purpose remains three important,
P4zxWqC_fCY26,5.23,5.36,  thing that is inform,Structure
,,,  persuade and then educate,
,,,  very important question generally when i,
,,,  see student,
,,,  preparing and presenting they forget,
,,,  that there is an audience who is going,
P4zxWqC_fCY27,5.38,5.5,  to watch them,No
,,,  who is going to view them and without,
,,,  thinking about the audience,
,,,  they just present deliver,
,,,  or share the information that 's not the,
,,,  right way of presentation dear,
P4zxWqC_fCY28,5.52,6.06,  whenever you are presenting you should,Structure
,,,  have,
,,,  these six critical question to be,
,,,  asked to yourself remember the wh family,
,,,  word who you are,
,,,  whom you are going to address what is it,
P4zxWqC_fCY29,6.09,6.21,  that you want to deliver,Structure
,,,  where are you right now when are you,
,,,  going to deliver the information,
,,,  why you think your presentation is so,
,,,  important,
,,,  and how can you convince the audience i,
P4zxWqC_fCY30,6.24,6.39,  repeat,Structure
,,,  the six critical question that every,
,,,  presentator,
,,,  must keep in his or her mind,
,,,  is these six,
,,,  so whenever we are talking about the,
P4zxWqC_fCY31,6.41,6.51,  sixth critical question,No
,,,  keep this in your mind dear death why am,
,,,  i presenting this particular,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  like when i wa watching your video you,
,,,  people were very nervous,
P4zxWqC_fCY32,6.53,7.06,  there wa lack of confidence you were,No
,,,  not even thinking that somebody,
,,,  else is going to watch you or view you,
,,,  the first thing that you should remember,
,,,  is while presenting you need to convince,
,,,  yourself,
P4zxWqC_fCY33,7.06,7.17,  this is the first if you uh talk about,Structure
,,,  the thumb rule of presentation,
,,,  you are going to convince other later so,
,,,  for example if you think,
,,,  60 people or 60 friend of mine are,
,,,  going to listen to me,
P4zxWqC_fCY34,7.19,7.29,  of course 60 are going to listen to you,No
,,,  but who is the speaker,
,,,  it is you so who should have strong,
,,,  command,
,,,  it is you so never forget that it is you,
,,,  who 's going to listen,
P4zxWqC_fCY35,7.31,7.4,  so you have to convince yourself how can,No
,,,  you convince yourself,
,,,  by building the confidence when can you,
,,,  build up the confidence,
,,,  when you have the clarity of what is it,
,,,  that you want to present,
P4zxWqC_fCY36,7.42,7.53,  so therefore these six question are,Structure
,,,  very very important,
,,,  you should know whom you are going to,
,,,  address what is it that you want to,
,,,  convey,
,,,  where are you right now when are you,
P4zxWqC_fCY37,7.56,8.05,  going to convey,Structure
,,,  why you think your point are so,
,,,  important and so relevant,
,,,  and how can you create that right,
,,,  impression the impression that can last,
,,,  for a long period of time,
P4zxWqC_fCY38,8.08,8.18,  so everyone when i ask you to judge,No
,,,  how many of you have watched your own,
,,,  video,
,,,  that you have posted on youtube quickly,
,,,  in the chat box,
,,,  did you watch your own video,
P4zxWqC_fCY39,8.21,8.32,  if you have watched your video just mark,No
,,,  yes,
,,,  if you did not write no no i see so many,
,,,  student who are saying that yes they,
,,,  have watched their video,
,,,  do you think your video wa the best,
P4zxWqC_fCY40,8.36,8.48,  do you think your video wa the best,No

,,,  others,
,,,  instead of neck pulling instead of,
P4zxWqC_fCY75,15.59,16.1,  saying that oh you ca n't do,No
,,,  rather saying you ca n't do encourage the,
,,,  person by saying,
,,,  oh very good i liked your video,
,,,  uh you could not make a proper eye,
,,,  contact but,
P4zxWqC_fCY76,16.11,16.2,  if you really develop the eye contact,No

P4zxWqC_fCY77,16.22,16.32,  can you change it if you give a,No
,,,  constructive feedback to your friend if,
,,,  you share those constructive feedback,
,,,  with your friend,

P4zxWqC_fCY79,16.49,17.01,  that your friend are going to give,Structure
,,,  good bad why to worry about good and bad,
,,,  what about the thing which can help you,
,,,  to improve yourself,
,,,  so work out on constructed feedback,
,,,  always remember whenever we talk about,
P4zxWqC_fCY80,17.03,17.12,  presentation skill,No
,,,  feedback is very very important and what,
,,,  kind of feedback do we expect,
,,,  we expect the constructive feedback what,
,,,  do we understand by constructive,
,,,  feedback which will help,
P4zxWqC_fCY81,17.13,17.25,  u to know our plus and minus,No
,,,  if we know about our plus we will try to,
,,,  improvise it more,
,,,  if we if we have come to know about our,
,,,  negative or if we have come to know,
,,,  about miner,
P4zxWqC_fCY82,17.26,17.37,  what we can do we have to think about,No
,,,  the developmental,
,,,  plan to overcome the grey area,
,,,  of our communication so keep this in,
,,,  your mind getting rid of your,
,,,  nervousness is very,
P4zxWqC_fCY83,17.39,17.5,  easy by focusing only on,No
,,,  your own self you should know that you,
,,,  are living your life you are not living,
,,,  others like,
,,,  so develop that level of confidence that,
,,,  if i am communicating and communicating,
P4zxWqC_fCY84,17.53,18.02,  for myself,No
,,,  so that others can listen to me others,
,,,  can understand my viewpoint,
,,,  my opinion and they must get persuaded,
,,,  with my,
,,,  act so keep this in your mind so,
P4zxWqC_fCY85,18.04,18.13,  whenever we talk about the public,No
,,,  speaking,
,,,  that is generally talking to the people,
,,,  these day,
,,,  it is through online video chat so even,
,,,  when you are video chatting even when,
P4zxWqC_fCY86,18.15,18.25,  you are sharing your uh,No
,,,  information with the help of video you,
,,,  should always remember,

,,,  skill can open door but if you are,
,,,  having poor,
,,,  public speaking skill it will only and,
,,,  only,
,,,  close your nose so keep this in your,
P4zxWqC_fCY90,19.09,19.19,  mind so if,No
,,,  if you really want to be a great manager,
,,,  if you really want to be a great,
,,,  techie guy you should work out on your,
,,,  communication skill,
,,,  you have to work out on your public,

,,,  from right source,
,,,  are you going to share the right,
,,,  information with others or not,

,,,  based on your planning,
,,,  you have to practice you have to arrange,
,,,  the thought and idea in a logical way,
,,,  you need to engage your audience uh make,
,,,  them a part of your speech,
P4zxWqC_fCY95,20.11,20.21,  connect with them and when you 're,No
,,,  connecting with them,
,,,  that will always help to add on with,
,,,  your body language,
,,,  you can develop good eye contact you can,
,,,  always have that beautiful smile on your,
P4zxWqC_fCY96,20.23,20.32,  face to present that you are a confident,No
,,,  chap,

,,,  positive way that,
P4zxWqC_fCY97,20.33,20.42,  whatever you 're going to present that,Structure
,,,  will be,
,,,  helpful for the audience that will help,
,,,  them to,
,,,  learn more to educate themselves more,
,,,  and always,
P4zxWqC_fCY98,20.43,20.53,  remember in child nervousness a a,No
,,,  part of our,
,,,  physical future so for example if i talk,
,,,  about nervous,
,,,  yeah yes it is a common practice that we,
,,,  all will tend to become nervous,
P4zxWqC_fCY99,20.54,21.05,  we all will be nervous when we have to,No
,,,  present it for the first time,
,,,  in front of a huge gathering but we,
,,,  should not show our nervousness,
,,,  how can we overcome our nervous or how,
,,,  can we overcome our anxiety,
P4zxWqC_fCY100,21.07,21.18,  by connecting the audience how can you,No
,,,  connect with the audience,
,,,  by interacting with them get acquainted,
,,,  with the audience try to have a good,
,,,  congenial,
,,,  relationship with them create that,
P4zxWqC_fCY101,21.2,21.29,  congenial environment,No
,,,  wherein you can communicate with,
,,,  confidence,
,,,  do n't you do the same thing when you are,
,,,  coming and interacting for the first,
,,,  time with your new friend,
P4zxWqC_fCY102,21.3,21.43,  the first thing that you do is you ask,No
,,,  question what 's your name,
,,,  hi hello i am so and so and i,
,,,  am i have done my graduation or i have,
,,,  done my 12th from so and so school or,
,,,  college,
P4zxWqC_fCY103,21.44,21.53,  what about you can i come to know more,No
,,,  about you,
,,,  or sometimes we ask from which place you,
,,,  belong to,
,,,  or from where are you coming to the,
,,,  campus so there are different question,
P4zxWqC_fCY104,21.55,22.03,  why,Structure
,,,  why are you asking these question it is,
,,,  only to build up that relationship to,
,,,  get acquainted,
,,,  moment you get acquainted you develop,
,,,  the relationship the similar thing you,
P4zxWqC_fCY105,22.05,22.12,  have to do whenever you are giving the,No
,,,  presentation,
,,,  so the audience with whom or in front of,
,,,  whom you are going to give the,
,,,  presentation,
,,,  develop the relationship build up the,
P4zxWqC_fCY106,22.14,22.23,  acquaintance develop a good congenial,No
,,,  environment so that,
,,,  people can love listening to you people,
,,,  can say that yes,
,,,  whatever you 're going to say i 'm i 'm,
,,,  happy to listen to you,
P4zxWqC_fCY107,22.25,22.33,  so calming down nerve can happen only,No
,,,  when you have that positive attitude,
,,,  where you can work on on your body,
,,,  language,
,,,  then you can engage your audience and,
,,,  how is,
P4zxWqC_fCY108,22.34,22.47,  these three thing possible only when,No
,,,  you plan,
,,,  and practice so keep these thing in,
,,,  your mind,
,,,  audience are very very important,
,,,  so know who the audience is is it your,
P4zxWqC_fCY109,22.5,22.58,  teacher,No
,,,  are they the external people who are,
,,,  coming from the different,
,,,  uh industry or from the different,
,,,  academy,
,,,  academician or are they your family,
P4zxWqC_fCY110,23,23.09,  member,No
,,,  are they their friend or are the,
,,,  junior,
,,,  so in front of whom are you going to,
,,,  communicate know about your audience,
,,,  that is very important,
P4zxWqC_fCY111,23.11,23.24,  based on the knowledge of the audience,Structure
,,,  you should design and draft say for,
,,,  example if your teacher say,
,,,  you 're going to present a presentation,
,,,  in front of your class so remember yes,
,,,  of course your teacher is,
P4zxWqC_fCY112,23.25,23.36,  knowledgeable present but you should,No
,,,  also know that along with your teacher,
,,,  there are 50 odd student of your class,
,,,  who are going to listen to your,
,,,  presentation so if you try to,
,,,  boost your knowledge if you really try,
P4zxWqC_fCY113,23.39,23.48,  to say that i know,No
,,,  too much and my friend they do not so,
,,,  then you,
,,,  are in fact discouraging your audience,
,,,  you are not getting connected with your,
,,,  audience,
P4zxWqC_fCY114,23.49,23.59,  so do n't boast in front of your audience,No
,,,  try to connect with them how can you,
,,,  connect with them when you remember the,
,,,  three,
,,,  the magic three s that we have discussed,
,,,  every time,
P4zxWqC_fCY115,24,24.09,  the presentation that you 're going to,Structure
,,,  present should be short simple,
,,,  and straightforward so that the people,
,,,  whosoever are listening,
,,,  they can very well get connected with,
,,,  your speech so,
P4zxWqC_fCY116,24.1,24.2,  know what you want to present how much,No
,,,  information that you want to share,
,,,  do n't show any kind of dissimilarity oh,
,,,  i can,
,,,  speak good english you ca n't i can,
,,,  present very well you ca n't,
P4zxWqC_fCY117,24.22,24.35,  do n't uh try to humiliate others if you,No
,,,  try to humiliate,
,,,  others in fact in return you 're going to,
,,,  get the same kind of humiliation,
,,,  so do n't create that disparity know,
,,,  about the age know about the gender,
P4zxWqC_fCY118,24.37,24.48,  and then present your speech accordingly,No
,,,  also many time it may happen that,
,,,  people may,
,,,  feel comfortable in certain language,
,,,  say for example when you are interacting,
,,,  with the people who are there in the,
P4zxWqC_fCY119,24.5,25.02,  village,No
,,,  who may not be good in understanding,
,,,  english language and if you present your,
,,,  complete presentation,
,,,  in english you 're committing a crime,
,,,  according to the understanding according,
P4zxWqC_fCY120,25.05,25.14,  to the level,No
,,,  of the knowledge that the audience ha,
,,,  you have to,
,,,  change your presentation and that is the,
,,,  reason every now and then i keep telling,
,,,  you,
P4zxWqC_fCY121,25.14,25.24,  all of course english is important but,No
,,,  apart from,
,,,  english you should work out on different,
,,,  language,
,,,  the more number of language you know,
,,,  you will be able to,
P4zxWqC_fCY122,25.25,25.34,  interact and connect your audience in,No
,,,  much better way,
,,,  so keep this in your mind that knowing,
,,,  language,
,,,  will always add a lot,
,,,  a we have already discussed during,
P4zxWqC_fCY123,25.36,25.47,  letter writing technique of writing,No
,,,  the letter in order to grab the,
,,,  attention of the audience similarly when,
,,,  we are presenting,
,,,  remember attention interest desire and,
,,,  action,
P4zxWqC_fCY124,25.47,25.58,  whatever you are speaking whatever you,No
,,,  are presenting,
,,,  it should grab the attention of the,
,,,  audience it must generate,
,,,  interest in the audience the desire to,
,,,  know more,
P4zxWqC_fCY125,25.58,26.1,  should be clearly visible in the,No
,,,  audience finally the audience should be,
,,,  able to,
,,,  understand they may say yes they may ask,
,,,  their query with great confidence they,
,,,  may be able to say that,
P4zxWqC_fCY126,26.11,26.22,  look i could not understand this can you,No
,,,  explain me once again,
,,,  if the audience is asking doubt that,
,,,  mean you are,
,,,  able to apply the technique of ida,
,,,  if there is no action if only,
P4zxWqC_fCY127,26.25,26.35,  desire to know more is there with great,No
,,,  attention and interest,
,,,  still you will not be able to present or,
,,,  you will not get that,
,,,  good feedback so if you are talking,
,,,  about great feedback if you 're really,
P4zxWqC_fCY128,26.37,26.5,  looking for,Structure
,,,  a wonderful feedback from your audience,
,,,  remember the technique either which say,
,,,  grab the attention generate interest,
,,,  the desire to know more should be,
,,,  developed,
P4zxWqC_fCY129,26.51,27.01,  and finally the action from the audience,No
,,,  that,
,,,  wow this wa a great speech,
,,,  a big round of applause can definitely,
,,,  make you feel,
,,,  overwhelmed because you know that you,
P4zxWqC_fCY130,27.03,27.13,  have presented very well,No
,,,  not many question from the audience,
,,,  again it prof that they were very well,
,,,  connected,
,,,  and you have done fantastically good if,
,,,  the audience wa keen to know more and,
P4zxWqC_fCY131,27.15,27.22,  if they want,No
,,,  to ask more or if they are willing to,
,,,  know more,
,,,  that mean you have done extremely good,
,,,  so,
,,,  always remember the ida technique is,
P4zxWqC_fCY132,27.25,27.36,  going to help you,No
,,,  a lot these three,
,,,  are very very important which i could,
,,,  not,
,,,  find in your presentation,
,,,  in most of your presentation you were,
P4zxWqC_fCY133,27.38,27.47,  focusing,No
,,,  only on the content many time many of,
,,,  you,
,,,  were reading the content you have by,
,,,  hearted you did not,
,,,  practice learning by hacking something,
P4zxWqC_fCY134,27.51,28.04,  is different practicing is different,No
,,,  when you practice this you,
,,,  understand it logical application,
,,,  a a student of management i want you,
,,,  all to understand the logical,
,,,  application of the different sentence,
P4zxWqC_fCY135,28.06,28.15,  that you would create while writing the,No
,,,  content,
,,,  if you are saying any line you should,
,,,  know why am i saying this particular,
,,,  line,
,,,  if i am quoting a fact what is the,
P4zxWqC_fCY136,28.17,28.26,  important of that fact and figure,Structure
,,,  how the audience are going to get,
,,,  benefit by,
,,,  that particular information say for,
,,,  example if i 'm saying,
,,,  that bihar is one of the promising,
P4zxWqC_fCY137,28.29,28.38,  state,No
,,,  where number of industry can come and,
,,,  set up their business,
,,,  so when i say this what would be the,
,,,  total population,
,,,  what about the graduate what about the,
P4zxWqC_fCY138,28.41,28.49,  number of industry,No
,,,  what about the kind of industry will it,
,,,  be manufacturing,
,,,  or will it be service based if i talk,
,,,  about technology,
,,,  are we talking about only web designing,
P4zxWqC_fCY139,28.52,29.01,  or graphic designing,No
,,,  or can we think about software,
,,,  engineering organization,
,,,  can we think about our based engineering,
,,,  organization,
,,,  so there can be a lot so always remember,
P4zxWqC_fCY140,29.04,29.16,  whenever you present,No
,,,  you have to focus on this acronym which,
,,,  call,
,,,  back visual auditory and kinesthetic,
,,,  visual develop good eye contact,
,,,  auditory the voice should be clear,
P4zxWqC_fCY141,29.19,29.3,  kinesthetic,No
,,,  connect your audience with your gesture,
,,,  do n't stand,
,,,  at one place in a still position,
,,,  in fact if you 're standing still it,
,,,  look a if you are,
P4zxWqC_fCY142,29.32,29.42,  reading something in front of others,No
,,,  to just prove that you are good at,
,,,  cramming you are,
,,,  good at cramming the thing you are good,
,,,  at remembering the thing,
,,,  no presentation is not to show that you,
P4zxWqC_fCY143,29.45,29.54,  are good at memory,No
,,,  presentation say that there ha to be a,
,,,  logical connection,
,,,  whatever you deliver with your audience,
,,,  so that,
,,,  gesture is going to help you the,
P4zxWqC_fCY144,29.56,30.05,  movement that you are going to show,No
,,,  with your hand the movement that you,
,,,  are going to,
,,,  express with your voice with your,
,,,  tonality of voice,
,,,  so keep this in your mind that is going,
P4zxWqC_fCY145,30.08,30.18,  to bridge the gap between you,No
,,,  and your audience the next is body,
,,,  language a i have already stated,
,,,  work out on your eye contact workout on,
,,,  your facial expression,
,,,  connect with your audience through your,
P4zxWqC_fCY146,30.2,30.32,  gesture particularly when it is,No
,,,  video through video when you are,
,,,  sharing the opinion it is very important,
,,,  that you work out on your,
,,,  gesture if you are presenting offline,
,,,  in front of the audience then of course,
P4zxWqC_fCY147,30.34,30.45,  you have to work out on your posture,No
,,,  a well a on the body the distance that,
,,,  you manage between,
,,,  you and the audience is called a,
,,,  proximity all right,
,,,  remember the social distancing that we,
P4zxWqC_fCY148,30.47,30.55,  have talked,No
,,,  we talked about the space when we were,
,,,  talking about the different,
,,,  form of communication we have discussed,
,,,  that there are two important form of,
,,,  communication,
P4zxWqC_fCY149,30.56,31.06,  verbal and non under verbal we,No
,,,  discus,
,,,  it could be oral or written when we talk,
,,,  about non,
,,,  we have clearly identified that it could,
,,,  be related to body,
P4zxWqC_fCY150,31.08,31.18,  it could be related to sign and it could,No
,,,  be related to symbol,
,,,  when we talk about body the space the,
,,,  distance that we,
,,,  maintain between a person and to the,
,,,  other,
P4zxWqC_fCY151,31.19,31.27,  is called a proximity the gap that we,No
,,,  maintain,
,,,  from a person to the person the common,
,,,  thing that you all must have come to,
,,,  know,
,,,  during the covert time social distancing,
P4zxWqC_fCY152,31.3,31.39,  that is a gap of eight foot minimum four,No
,,,  foot to,
,,,  eight foot is called a social,
,,,  distancing,
,,,  so you should know when you are,
,,,  presenting where you should stand,
P4zxWqC_fCY153,31.41,31.51,  what should be the gap between you and,No
,,,  your audience are you going to be,
,,,  very close to them if you have a mic can,
,,,  you be,
,,,  at a distance and then can you create,
,,,  that eye,
P4zxWqC_fCY154,31.52,32.02,  contact with others please understand,No
,,,  these and we you,
,,,  you must practice this you have to,
,,,  regularly practice the way you 're going,
,,,  to communicate,
,,,  when you are using a mic how you 're,
P4zxWqC_fCY155,32.05,32.15,  going to mellow down your voice,No
,,,  if there is no mic how you 're going to,
,,,  raise the voice,
,,,  how you 're going to be loud that is the,
,,,  difference between shout and loud,
,,,  i 'm not asking you to shout i 'm asking,
P4zxWqC_fCY156,32.17,32.28,  you to be,No
,,,  loud so that even the person or even if,
,,,  the mic,
,,,  is not able to grab the voice but,
,,,  because of the loud voice it can,
,,,  understand it can grab or it can,
P4zxWqC_fCY157,32.3,32.41,  connect with the audience in a right way,No
,,,  so these are the common thing that you,
,,,  have to keep in your mind whenever you,
,,,  are developing,
,,,  if you are working on your non,
,,,  skill,
P4zxWqC_fCY158,32.42,32.53,  please remember eye contact it always,No
,,,  say that you are a friendly person,
,,,  your effort are sincere you are,
,,,  assertive by nature assertive mean,
,,,  you are ready to accept yes or no if,
,,,  people are,
P4zxWqC_fCY159,32.54,33.06,  if a person or if a people or if a group,No
,,,  of person say that,
,,,  i like your opinion they 'll say yes,
,,,  sometimes even if they do n't like they,
,,,  will say no to you and you should be,
,,,  able to accept their opinion,
P4zxWqC_fCY160,33.08,33.18,  when they like they 'll say yes but they,No
,,,  do not like,
,,,  they 'll say no you should be able to say,
,,,  yes to yes,
,,,  and even no to yes that is called a,
,,,  assertive and confident,
P4zxWqC_fCY161,33.19,33.3,  if you 're avoiding eye contact this,No
,,,  talk about your,
,,,  passive nature and it also talk about,
,,,  or show your insecurity,
,,,  whenever you are parting somebody you,
,,,  back it talk about,
P4zxWqC_fCY162,33.31,33.39,  encouragement you must have seen your,No
,,,  parent they always tap you at your back,
,,,  is n't it,
,,,  whenever you have done something good,
,,,  they they say that,
,,,  we are giving shabashi to you and why,
P4zxWqC_fCY163,33.41,33.49,  that shabashi because to show that you,No
,,,  are,
,,,  getting encouraged by that particular,
,,,  path,
,,,  so scratching the head this talk about,
,,,  this believing this talk about,
P4zxWqC_fCY164,33.51,34.01,  you you are confused smiling again this,No
,,,  talk about,
,,,  encouragement when you are nervous you,
,,,  are going to bit your lip,
,,,  you whenever you are fearful or anxious,
,,,  you always,
P4zxWqC_fCY165,34.02,34.14,  bit your lip tapping the foot again it,No
,,,  talk about nervousness,
,,,  now if you are having a erect posture,
,,,  a good posture it always talk about,
,,,  your confidence and assertiveness,
,,,  folding arm it is good positive a well,
P4zxWqC_fCY166,34.17,34.26,  a,No
,,,  negative when you 're folding arm and,
,,,  when you 're paying attention to the,
,,,  audience with a smile on your face,
,,,  that mean you are a great listener,
,,,  remember the posture that is always,
P4zxWqC_fCY167,34.28,34.38,  shown or portrayed of swami vivekada,No
,,,  you will always see him with a smile,
,,,  unfolded arm because he wa a great,
,,,  listener he always,
,,,  encouraged people to speak so that he,
,,,  could listen and understand them,
P4zxWqC_fCY168,34.4,34.51,  but if there is no smile and if you are,No
,,,  having that,
,,,  long face nervousness could be seen on,
,,,  your face and with your folded arm,
,,,  this show that you are not ready to,
,,,  accept what others are shaking,
P4zxWqC_fCY169,34.53,35.05,  so shaking head again is a negative,No
,,,  part so always remember even when you,
,,,  are observing the,
,,,  audience when they are yawning when they,
,,,  are smiling when they are folding up,
,,,  when they raise their eyebrow or when,
P4zxWqC_fCY170,35.07,35.17,  they look at you with the narrowed eye,No
,,,  always remember that they are showing,
,,,  their disinterest,
,,,  or bowed them when they are leaning down,
,,,  again it talk about,
,,,  uh their interest most of the time you,
P4zxWqC_fCY171,35.19,35.27,  must have seen when you are very keen,No
,,,  when you are,
,,,  grabbing attention or when you want to,
,,,  know more,
,,,  you immediately bend up so that is again,
,,,  a plus point,
P4zxWqC_fCY172,35.28,35.39,  but not the slouching in the seat not to,No
,,,  bend and closing their eye that is,
,,,  again wrong thing,
,,,  so you have to work out on these thing,
,,,  you should also know and you should,
,,,  also understand through the body,
P4zxWqC_fCY173,35.41,35.5,  language of the audience,No
,,,  so when you are working on these again i,
,,,  say,
,,,  work out on your volume work out on the,
,,,  tone,
,,,  and work out on the face do n't be a very,
P4zxWqC_fCY174,35.53,36.03,  fast reader or speaker,No
,,,  you should always work out on uh the,
,,,  pace at which you 're going to,
,,,  communicate with others the volume,
,,,  matter a lot,
,,,  along with the tonality of the voice,
P4zxWqC_fCY175,36.06,36.14,  okay,No
,,,  when you do this you are going to,
,,,  improve your,
,,,  active listening skill you will be able,
,,,  to understand,
,,,  what your audience are trying to say and,
P4zxWqC_fCY176,36.17,36.28,  you will be able to convince them all,Structure
,,,  right,
,,,  so these are the the last take away from,
,,,  this particular session,
,,,  based on the video please remember this,
,,,  particular session,
P4zxWqC_fCY177,36.29,36.39,  i have designed only to make you all,No
,,,  understand,
,,,  whenever you upload your video before,
,,,  uploading it,
,,,  check it once or twice whether you are,
,,,  able to,
P4zxWqC_fCY178,36.4,36.52,  deliver the main content or not,No
,,,  whether you will be able to grab the,
,,,  attention of the audience or not,
,,,  all the important point are well,
,,,  presented or not,
,,,  whether you are able to take the preview,
P4zxWqC_fCY179,36.55,37.04,  say for example have you done any,No
,,,  rehearsal,
,,,  did you take a video recording after,
,,,  judging that yes you were able to,
,,,  present it in a proper way,
,,,  are you going to once again take a,
P4zxWqC_fCY180,37.06,37.16,  retake,Structure
,,,  or take upload the same thing,
,,,  if you think that you are dissatisfied,
,,,  can you rehearse,
,,,  can you take couple of rehearsal and,
,,,  then finally,
P4zxWqC_fCY181,37.17,37.29,  give a final take and then upload your,No
,,,  video,
,,,  also remember who the audience is,
,,,  please remember one thing whenever you,
,,,  see any presentation,
,,,  the presentation that you are seeing,
P4zxWqC_fCY182,37.31,37.45,  which are used by your teacher,No
,,,  there should be no spelling error the,
,,,  presentation should be,
,,,  properly visible to the audience,
,,,  the font size should be correct the,
,,,  color,
P4zxWqC_fCY183,37.45,37.55,  the background should be correct,No
,,,  otherwise,
,,,  the viewer they can not see it so if you,
,,,  are using,
,,,  any tool and technique or aid you,
,,,  should be,
P4zxWqC_fCY184,37.56,38.08,  more conscious about it all right the,No
,,,  logical arrangement of your content,
,,,  matter a lot fact again what you are,
,,,  what kind of information you are sharing,
,,,  the information should grab the,
,,,  attention remember the technique either,
P4zxWqC_fCY185,38.1,38.21,  attention interest desire action,No
,,,  so how do you include the fact and,
,,,  figure how are you going to give,
,,,  example how are you going to connect,
,,,  the audience,
,,,  by sharing the opinion of the expert,
P4zxWqC_fCY186,38.24,38.36,  and what about the statistic what about,No
,,,  the,
,,,  technique that you 're going to use in,
,,,  order to present the table and figure,
,,,  these are very very important all right,
,,,  i 'm going to stop it here because the,
P4zxWqC_fCY187,38.39,38.49,  next one,No
,,,  is very very important when we talk,
,,,  about using,
,,,  visual aid when we talk about power,
,,,  point presentation this we are going to,
,,,  do,
P4zxWqC_fCY188,38.5,39.06,  after some day after finishing that,No
,,,  is on friday we are going to have this,
,,,  session on use of visual aid,
,,,  and the way we are going to present the,
,,,  pictographics or infographics in our,
,,,  presentation,
P4zxWqC_fCY189,39.07,39.2,  so i end up here on the topic called,Structure
,,,  presentation skill,
,,,  in case if you have any doubt you can,
,,,  definitely,
,,,  ask me i 'll give you five minute time,
,,,  to open up for a discussion and to ask,
P4zxWqC_fCY190,39.23,39.31,  and to clear your,Structure
,,,  doubt all right in case if you have any,
,,,  doubt,
,,,  do n't hesitate in asking me the,
,,,  question,
,,,  so that i can clear them,
yGQrYH9XOSE1,0,0.12,  hello and welcome to this video on,No
,,,  presentation skill from the Department,
,,,  of Engineering Library University of,
,,,  Cambridge in this video we will cover,
,,,  the following point telling your story,
,,,  managing your time planning presenting,
yGQrYH9XOSE2,0.15,0.28,  with style presenting with confidence,No
,,,  dealing with question want to learn to,
,,,  avoid this how many of you have seen,
,,,  something like this in presentation the,
,,,  problem is that it 's too cluttered it 's,
,,,  difficult to read and too many color,
yGQrYH9XOSE3,0.31,0.44,  and font make it hard to understand a,No
,,,  bad presentation can really damage your,
,,,  chance at getting the information you,
,,,  need across to your audience before you,
,,,  begin ask yourself why am I giving this,
,,,  presentation consider what you want the,
yGQrYH9XOSE4,0.46,0.57,  outcome of your presentation to be are,Structure
,,,  you trying to persuade people to do,
,,,  something are you trying to teach them,
,,,  who is my audience you need to think,
,,,  about who your audience actually are a,
,,,  this will impact how you deliver your,
yGQrYH9XOSE5,0.58,1.09,  message you also need to think about the,No
,,,  level of knowledge they have on a,
,,,  subject what message am i delivering,
,,,  what 's the one bit of knowledge that you,
,,,  want them to take away and do n't,
,,,  undersell yourself remember you are the,
yGQrYH9XOSE6,1.11,1.25,  expert on your own research your,Structure
,,,  presentation tell a story about your,
,,,  research like all good story it need,
,,,  a beginning introduce your research a,
,,,  middle explain what you did and an end,
,,,  discus your result when planning your,
yGQrYH9XOSE7,1.29,1.39,  presentation you need to start with the,Structure
,,,  key message that you want to deliver,
,,,  and then build your presentation around,
,,,  u try to limit the message to three,
,,,  otherwise you risk information overload,
,,,  anything which doe n't fit with the,
yGQrYH9XOSE8,1.41,1.5,  message doe n't belong in a presentation,Structure
,,,  and need to be taken out to prevent you,
,,,  from going off topic resist the,
,,,  temptation to put everything you know,
,,,  about a topic into your presentation you,
,,,  want to avoid overloading your audience,
yGQrYH9XOSE9,1.54,2.03,  have you thought about your audience if,Structure
,,,  you 're working or something really,
,,,  specialist will people understand what,
,,,  you 're trying to communicate to them,
,,,  take some time to break down any,
,,,  technical jargon so that non expert can,
yGQrYH9XOSE10,2.05,2.15,  understand what you 're talking about or,Structure
,,,  just leave some space in your,
,,,  presentation for explanation we all do,
,,,  it we all have term and,
,,,  name that we work with every day so,
,,,  much so that they become a second,
yGQrYH9XOSE11,2.16,2.29,  language and we often forget that others,No
,,,  might have no idea what we 're talking,
,,,  about in short presentation timing is,
,,,  everything and can make or break a,
,,,  presentation too little information and,
,,,  you 're left with silence at the end too,
yGQrYH9XOSE12,2.31,2.41,  much and you 'll overrun or have to skip,Structure
,,,  over section which look unprofessional,
,,,  know in advance how long you have to,
,,,  present and how long you have four,
,,,  question if you 're presenting a a,
,,,  group decide how to divide your labor,
yGQrYH9XOSE13,2.43,2.54,  who will be responsible for what part,Structure
,,,  how long will each section be rehearse,
,,,  your presentation with a timer set for,
,,,  how long you have if you go over you,
,,,  need to decide what to cut or end it,
,,,  down planning is the key to success,
yGQrYH9XOSE14,2.57,3.08,  craft your presentation based around,Structure
,,,  your key message and think about,
,,,  structure and flow you have your key,
,,,  message and that can really help you to,
,,,  structure the rest of your presentation,
,,,  always keep that key message in the back,
yGQrYH9XOSE15,3.1,3.21,  of your mind keep it on a post no,No
,,,  next to your computer if something,
,,,  doe n't fit with your key message then,
,,,  it doe n't need to be in your,
,,,  presentation be strict storyboard your,
,,,  presentation this work quite well if,
yGQrYH9XOSE16,3.23,3.33,  you 're a visual planner it sound,Structure
,,,  obvious but you need to have a logical,
,,,  flow to your presentation a beginning a,
,,,  middle and an end at the end summarize,
,,,  your presentation and reiterate your top,
,,,  takeaway message always leave room for,
yGQrYH9XOSE17,3.36,3.46,  question but do n't feel this ha to be,No
,,,  the very last thing you do you can ask a,
,,,  feedback a you go through if you 're,
,,,  comfortable with u but it ca n't disrupt,
,,,  your flow if you want to wait until the,
,,,  end of the presentation that habit is,
yGQrYH9XOSE18,3.47,3.59,  the second to last thing this mean that,Structure
,,,  you can leave the audience with a good,
,,,  final impression leave them with a,
,,,  message you want to leave them with,
,,,  design is not an add to your,
,,,  presentation it 's part of how you tell,
yGQrYH9XOSE19,4.01,4.15,  your story the style and design of,No
,,,  slide or visual aid shape the overall,
,,,  feel of your presentation,
,,,  and slide also help you to keep on,
,,,  track the really basic stuff that go,
,,,  almost without saying I think about your,
yGQrYH9XOSE20,4.17,4.27,  font size font are great if used well,No
,,,  but limit them to about three per side,
,,,  anymore is distracting any smaller than,
,,,  a size 24 text and you 're putting too,
,,,  much text on the slide,
,,,  remember this is a visual aid not a,
yGQrYH9XOSE21,4.29,4.4,  document in it own right if you 're,No
,,,  trying to put more than around 50 word,
,,,  on a slide you 're writing a handout not,
,,,  a presentation think about your color,
,,,  choice certain color just do n't belong,
,,,  together and others make text harder to,
yGQrYH9XOSE22,4.41,4.53,  read think about accessibility issue,No
,,,  for people who may be color blind if you,
,,,  have to use animation to make a point do,
,,,  with a little fuss a possible if you,
,,,  need to display some data make sure it 's,
,,,  relevant clear and easy to read do n't,
yGQrYH9XOSE23,4.56,5.11,  have something that you have to say you,No
,,,  ca n't see on this graph but the result,
,,,  show San serif font such a Calibri and,
,,,  Arial are much more readable than serif,
,,,  font such a Times New Roman font like,
,,,  Comic Sans are best saved for personal,
yGQrYH9XOSE24,5.13,5.31,  not professional use one slide equal,No
,,,  one idea do n't overload your slide,
,,,  having one key idea per slide make it,
,,,  easy for your audience to follow and,
,,,  help you to pace your presentation well,
,,,  avoid the wall of doom the wall of doom,
yGQrYH9XOSE25,5.34,5.44,  or a wall of text is what happens when,No
,,,  you put fart image text on a slide it 's,
,,,  overwhelming and distracting there 's no,
,,,  point in just reading out a huge amount,
,,,  of text from a slide the point of a,
,,,  presentation is n't just to read a paper,
yGQrYH9XOSE26,5.46,5.57,  and if your audience are trying to read,No
,,,  your slide then they wo n't be listening,
,,,  to what it is that you 're saying bullet,
,,,  point can help break down complex,
,,,  information into simple key word or,
,,,  idea but if use of every slide they can,
yGQrYH9XOSE27,5.59,6.12,  look crowded monotonous and repetitive,No
,,,  if you are using bullet point keep them,
,,,  short and do n't draw them out of,
,,,  multiple line a well graph,
,,,  or figure can be an effective way of,
,,,  displaying information at a glance and,
yGQrYH9XOSE28,6.13,6.25,  could communicate more than a wall of,No
,,,  text but it 's worth thinking about what,
,,,  type of chart or graph is best to convey,
,,,  your data because a poorly used graph,
,,,  can be off image can help break,
,,,  up text on a slide use them to reinforce,
yGQrYH9XOSE29,6.27,6.4,  a point or a a visual metaphor,No
,,,  remember to source Creative Commons,
,,,  image not every image that you find on,
,,,  the Internet can be legally used you,
,,,  want to avoid this water,
,,,  mark and pixelated image look,
yGQrYH9XOSE30,6.42,6.56,  seriously unprofessional everyone is,No
,,,  nervous before a presentation you can,
,,,  help yourself by being prepared taking,
,,,  some time to relax even if that mean,
,,,  taking ten second to breathe before,
,,,  starting think about your body language,
yGQrYH9XOSE31,6.59,7.09,  you might be terrified inside but try,No
,,,  not to show it on the outside do n't fold,
,,,  your arm a it 's a defensive position,
,,,  and will close you off to your audience,
,,,  whether you mean to or not if you 're,
,,,  presenting from a podium you can use it,
yGQrYH9XOSE32,7.11,7.23,  to hide your shaking knee to start with,No
,,,  but do n't be afraid to move around,
,,,  either keep your body language open and,
,,,  smile if you find a friendly face in the,
,,,  audience present to them or even better,
,,,  find a few spot in the audience left,
yGQrYH9XOSE33,7.25,7.36,  center right and move between looking at,No
,,,  those point throughout your,
,,,  presentation doe someone have a cool,
,,,  hair color are they wearing an,
,,,  interesting top whatever it is use those,
,,,  point to keep engaging with your,
yGQrYH9XOSE34,7.37,7.5,  audience and do n't spend too long,No
,,,  looking at your note or at your own,
,,,  slide would you be come to a presenting,
,,,  without a script now this is an entirely,
,,,  personal choice but it come back to,
,,,  that eye contact and engagement with,
yGQrYH9XOSE35,7.52,8,  your audience if you 're buried in your,No
,,,  note and do n't look up at all then,
,,,  you 've lost your audience before you 've,
,,,  even begun,
,,,  you could have note on your slide and,
,,,  see them in presenter mode but I would,
yGQrYH9XOSE36,8.02,8.11,  recommend that you try to present,No
,,,  without the script or possibly even,
,,,  without note wherever you can that way,
,,,  your speech is more free and you 're able,
,,,  to use your hand so gesture and be more,
,,,  natural and presenting it is scary but,
yGQrYH9XOSE37,8.14,8.26,  you ca n't do it with practice and a good,No
,,,  knowledge of your subject matter be,
,,,  prepared and know your material this,
,,,  will help you to anticipate the,
,,,  question you are likely to get do n't be,
,,,  afraid to admit that you do n't know but,
yGQrYH9XOSE38,8.28,8.4,  do offer to find a solution try to be,Structure
,,,  clear but brief you can always check if,
,,,  you 've answered that question when they,
,,,  finished do n't be afraid to clarify the,
,,,  question and make sure the rest of the,
,,,  audience heard the question and if,
yGQrYH9XOSE39,8.41,8.52,  necessary repeat it for them this mean,No
,,,  that the audience know what you 're,
,,,  talking about,
,,,  and it give you extra thinking time,
,,,  what happens when thing go wrong the,
,,,  most important thing to do is,
yGQrYH9XOSE40,8.54,9.04,  calm the easiest way to prevent,No
,,,  disastrous prepare beforehand make sure,
,,,  the technology is working check it is,
,,,  compatible with what you want to do,
,,,  scoop up the room so you know the layout,
,,,  and feel more comfortable have a back,
yGQrYH9XOSE41,9.06,9.19,  plan have your slide saved in different,No
,,,  place or have a paper copy for real,
,,,  disaster chance are something might go,
,,,  wrong it 's how you handle it that make,
,,,  a difference and remember the audience,
,,,  wo n't always know there 's being the,
yGQrYH9XOSE43,9.2,9.39,  problem unless you let it show be clear,No
,,,  about what you are meant to be doing,
,,,  keep your slide concise and your main,
,,,  point and practice practice practice,
,,,  thank you for watching this video for,
,,,  help at any point contact the,
,,,  engineering library team at library at,
Uk_FtRshypI1,0,0.15,  In this lecture we 're looking at,No
,,,  highlighting visual aid and that mean,
,,,  two thing : first focusing the audience 's,
,,,  attention on your visual aid ; and second,
,,,  stating the visual 's general meaning . When,
,,,  you are presenting a visual aid to the,
Uk_FtRshypI2,0.17,0.32,  audience and you want them to look at it,No
,,,  to pay attention to it there are some,
,,,  key expression that you can use .,
,,,  Probably the most common is this :,
,,,  `` Ok let 's take a look at this slide ; '' or `` Ok,
,,,  let 's take a look at this chart . '',
Uk_FtRshypI3,0.33,0.49,  `` Ok let 's take a look at this graph . '' Or if,No
,,,  you want to speak more formally in a,
,,,  very formal presentation you may use,
,,,  this expression : `` I 'd like to draw your,
,,,  attention to this chart . '' Or `` I 'd like to,
,,,  draw your attention to this graph . '' ,
Uk_FtRshypI4,0.52,1.01,  more formal expression there . So that 's,No
,,,  focusing the audience 's attention . In,
,,,  other word you just saying to the,
,,,  audience `` look at this slide . '',
,,,  `` Look at this chart . '' `` Look at this graph . '',
,,,  Now that 's the first step . The second,
Uk_FtRshypI5,1.05,1.18,  step is to tell the audience what they,No
,,,  are looking at . What is it ?,
,,,  And here are some expression here for,
,,,  doing that : `` As you can see this is our,
,,,  sale data for the past quarter . '' `` Here we,
,,,  can see the number of word spoken per,
Uk_FtRshypI6,1.2,1.38,  minute . '' `` Here we can see the growth of,No
,,,  bacteria over time . '' So stating the visual 's,
,,,  general meaning . You might also choose to,
,,,  use one of these expression :,
,,,  `` This slide show our sale data . '' `` This next,
,,,  chart illustrates the number of word,
Uk_FtRshypI7,1.4,1.56,  spoken ; '' or `` This graph refers to the,No
,,,  growth of bacteria over time . '' So some,
,,,  various expression there for stating,
,,,  the visual 's general meaning ; in other,
,,,  word answering the question `` What are we,
,,,  looking at ? '',
Uk_FtRshypI8,1.57,2.09,  And another way to do that if you have a,Structure
,,,  line graph is to talk about the,
,,,  different type of line and we 're going,
,,,  to get into much more detail in the,
,,,  upcoming lecture and you 'll get a lot,
,,,  more information from the supplement to,
Uk_FtRshypI9,2.12,2.24,  this lecture,No
,,,  but basically in a line graph there are,
,,,  three type of line : there 's a solid,
,,,  line ; a broken line ; and a dotted line . And,
,,,  you can use these with various verb : so,
,,,  the solid line show the growth over,
Uk_FtRshypI10,2.28,2.44,  time ; the broken line illustrates,Structure
,,,  employee retention ; the dotted line,
,,,  refers to sale figure . So three type,
,,,  of line and again we 're going to get,
,,,  more into that later .,
,,,  So let 's take a look at some expression,
Uk_FtRshypI11,2.47,3.04,  in action for highlighting visual aid ...,No
,,,  Tis graphic illustrates the location,
,,,  of English speaker throughout the world,
,,,  a you can see ...,
,,,  This next map show the ubiquity of English . As you,
,,,  can see in most country english is spoken ...,
Uk_FtRshypI13,3.1,3.34,  I would like to draw your attention to,No
,,,  this chart . As you can see two third of,
,,,  the world 's scientist read academic,
,,,  paper or journal in English while only,
,,,  one of the world 's scientist read,
,,,  in another language .,
,,,  Ok so in this lecture we talked about,
,,,  highlighting visual aid,
,,,  this just mean focusing the attention,
,,,  of the audience on your visual aid and,
,,,  stating the visual 's general meaning,
upzjPKmMU8I1,0,0.12,  hi quasi Millington here is speaker and,No
,,,  speech coach and today we 're going to,
,,,  talk about how to use visual aid,
,,,  effectively in the presentation when it,
,,,  come to using visual aid in a,
,,,  presentation I 'm reminded of a quote I,
upzjPKmMU8I2,0.15,0.32,  once heard and said that audience will,No
,,,  forgive you for anything during a,
,,,  presentation except being boring and,
,,,  you 've probably seen it a boring,
,,,  presentation that had visual aid and,
,,,  there are so many mistake that are made,
upzjPKmMU8I3,0.34,0.49,  when using visual aid I probably wo n't,No
,,,  cover them all but here are five thing,
,,,  not to do when you use visual aid,
,,,  the first thing not to do is do n't read,
,,,  from your note or your visual aid and,
,,,  just make it a reading lecture where,
upzjPKmMU8I4,0.53,1.03,  you 're just reading off what 's on your,No
,,,  slide that 's one of the worst thing,
,,,  that you can do if you have a lot of,
,,,  information to get across to your,
,,,  audience instead just scan and say so,
,,,  you have to rehearse to get this down,
upzjPKmMU8I5,1.06,1.18,  and right but just scan the overall,Structure
,,,  point you want to say whether it 's on a,
,,,  cue card or on a sheet just scan it and,
,,,  then look up at your audience always be,
,,,  looking at your audience when you 're,
,,,  talking never be looking down at a piece,
upzjPKmMU8I6,1.2,1.33,  of paper or something else when you are,No
,,,  talking next tip is do n't turn your back,
,,,  to read a lot of time you 'll see,
,,,  presenter they will have something on,
,,,  their slide and they will turn their,
,,,  back to the audience to read it try your,
upzjPKmMU8I7,1.37,1.48,  best never have to have your back to,No
,,,  your audience one way to make sure that,
,,,  you do that is to have note in front of,
,,,  you that match what you want to say on,
,,,  the slide so you can just gesture,
,,,  backwards towards your overhead or your,
upzjPKmMU8I8,1.51,2.02,  slide and you never actually have to,No
,,,  look at it you should know from the,
,,,  note you 're looking at where you are in,
,,,  your presentation and be able to click,
,,,  through once again rehearsal is key when,
,,,  you are preparing to give a presentation,
upzjPKmMU8I9,2.05,2.15,  that ha visual aid in it the next tip,No
,,,  tip number three is do n't write essay,
,,,  on your slide the worst thing you can do,
,,,  when I think speak,
,,,  to do this out of nerve is that they,
,,,  have all of their information on their,
upzjPKmMU8I10,2.17,2.29,  slide and they just read all the,No
,,,  information that 's on theirs like listen,
,,,  if I can deliver your presentation using,
,,,  your slide because it 's the same,
,,,  information that you 're saying then of,
,,,  what use are you a the speaker you want,
upzjPKmMU8I11,2.32,2.44,  to make sure that your visual is just an,No
,,,  accompaniment to you it just add to,
,,,  what you are going to say there should,
,,,  be point on there picture that need,
,,,  explanation so that it 's just a,
,,,  reference point but the audience is,
upzjPKmMU8I12,2.47,2.56,  looking at you to give further,No
,,,  information to what you have on the,
,,,  slide so do n't put essay on there put,
,,,  short point put picture put,
,,,  entertaining thing on slide even short,
,,,  video that add to you a the speaker,
upzjPKmMU8I13,3,3.15,  not replace you tip number four is to,No
,,,  use open posture if you can try not to,
,,,  have anything between you and your,
,,,  audience if you 're behind a lectern or,
,,,  stand try to not stand behind that if,
,,,  you can I know that in some situation,
upzjPKmMU8I14,3.17,3.29,  is a more formal presentation and you,No
,,,  have to do that but a much a you can,
,,,  get out from behind table and podium,
,,,  and anything blocking the audience from,
,,,  seeing you and really experiencing you,
,,,  a the speaker get those out of the way,
upzjPKmMU8I15,3.32,3.43,  so that you can have an open,No
,,,  communication with your audience and,
,,,  finally make it a dialogue just because,
,,,  you are the presenter and you have all,
,,,  this information on your slide that you,
,,,  have to give to your audience do n't,
upzjPKmMU8I16,3.45,3.56,  assume that you should n't involve them,No
,,,  sometimes you may want to just have a,
,,,  question mark on your slide and then you,
,,,  ask a question and you get dialogue back,
,,,  and forth from your audience you may get,
,,,  a discussion that way also it make you,
upzjPKmMU8I17,3.59,4.1,  le nervous you 're not just imparting,No
,,,  thing to your audience I once heard a,
,,,  speaker say some of the best answer are,
,,,  often seated so a lot of time you may,
,,,  have all the information to share but we,
,,,  may get a golden nugget of information,
upzjPKmMU8I18,4.11,4.22,  from your audience by involving them,No
,,,  asking them question say what do you,
,,,  think and make it a dialogue it make it,
,,,  a much more friendly and interesting,
,,,  experience for your audience so remember,
,,,  these five tip for using visual,
upzjPKmMU8I20,4.25,4.46,  ADEs when you 're giving a presentation,No
,,,  share this video like it and of course,
,,,  subscribe to the channel make sure that,
,,,  when you are giving presentation if,
,,,  they 're visual or not anything that you,
,,,  have that 's an accompanying,
,,,  accompaniment to you should be something,
,,,  to just ask to you it should n't replace,
,,,  you until next time keep speaking share,
,,,  any conserving,
JF_m8AhkxuM1,0.13,0.46,  hello everyone welcome back to n p t e l mock course on developing soft skill and personality,No
,,,  this is week eight module number four lecture number forty six i am doctor ravichandran,
,,,  from the department of humanity and social science of i i t kanpur giving you this course,
,,,  now for the past eight week this is the concluding week and then i started with presentation,
,,,  skill and this module this lecture will conclude our discussion on presentation skill giving,
,,,  you more input on how to use visuals visuals is an aspect of non verbal communication along,
JF_m8AhkxuM2,0.55,1.29,  with body language we also need to know how you can use this effectively before i start,No
,,,  let take a quick review of what i do in the previous lecture in the previous lecture i,
,,,  ah addressed the issue of body language in public speaking i told you that the role of,
,,,  body language is so crucial that some people use very effective body language and get away,
,,,  with ah very fraudulent content also many politician for example they develop just,
,,,  skill with le content and use powerful body language to convince the audience but,
JF_m8AhkxuM3,1.36,2.06,  in order to you become a professional i emphasize that your content should be equally good a,No
,,,  well a your body language to make your body language good effective,
,,,  what should you do practice before the mirror in today context even you can use video,
,,,  captured on your mobile and then check that but nothing like mirror because you are doing,
,,,  it live and then just see what are thing you do not like to see and you can make modification,
,,,  appropriately thus suitable for the occasion do not hide when you are going to a podium,
JF_m8AhkxuM4,2.14,2.44,  dont hide ok be open be honest and maintain eye contact with all even if somebody is very,No
,,,  difficult to maintain eye contact with try to look at the person forehead so do not try,
,,,  to maintain the direct eye contact and try to maintain eye contact with those whom you,
,,,  like initially and slowly you try to spread through the audience ok it can be in the form,
,,,  of a triangle identify corner it can be in the form of a square and identify somebody,
,,,  in the middle and then keep shifting your eye but then that will give the audience,
JF_m8AhkxuM5,2.49,3.17,  that you are trying to maintain eye contact with all of them throughout do not shift leg,No
,,,  that is one leg up and then the other leg down so dont do that kind of movement do,
,,,  not hold on to anything that is holding something very firmly is indicating that you are nervous,
,,,  sometimes people hold on the chair that is kept before them they hold on to the desk,
,,,  that is kept before them they hold on to even choke piece ah giving the impression that,
,,,  a if they are going to smock ah a it if look like a cigarette they hold on thing,
JF_m8AhkxuM6,3.22,3.56,  they hold on pencil they hold on scale they hold on the pointer,No
,,,  now try to keep them on the table use them only when it is required so do not hold on,
,,,  to anything and all the time try to face the audience whether you create a very amicable,
,,,  response from them or not face the audience so you should be bold enough to face the audience,
,,,  and keep the palm open so dont try to ah close it dont try to cross it dont try to put it,
,,,  in your ah hand pocket keep it to open speak loudly and clearly in fact it 's the first,
JF_m8AhkxuM7,4.04,4.35,  thing you should be doing when you go there a a professional to check whether everybody,No
,,,  in the audience is able to hear you clearly and maintain a normal face do not speak too,
,,,  fast do not be deliberately to slow ok in both case you are exhibiting that you are,
,,,  nervous never slouch ok instead of a firm think that slouching is and then appearing,
,,,  to be too low because of the fact that you are low in confidence and never turn back,
,,,  to the audience or even if you are going to show something on the black board till try,
JF_m8AhkxuM8,4.4,5.16,  to maintain at least half eye contact with them never turn your back so that way you,No
,,,  will completely loose contact with the audience let look at the use of visuals now what are,
,,,  visuals first of all so visuals are those ah non verbal part of communication in which,
,,,  you do not use word you do not use the verbal part but you use picture you show photograph,
,,,  you can use graph pie chart map any kind of diagram and then ah the cross section,
,,,  sectional diagram such a frontal view aerial view ok and even a model a proto type of something,
JF_m8AhkxuM9,5.24,6.02,  which is bigger in size but you show a small module and the blueprint of a a house or,No
,,,  of a big project that you are planning to ah materialize,
,,,  now these thing without word but they are shown in a form of visuals now using visuals,
,,,  actually enhances the quality of your presentation ok instead of putting just word if you put,
,,,  some picture but then you should not deliberately put something like the face of every ah beautiful,
,,,  actress and then so that everybody look at it but they will miss the main point of what,
JF_m8AhkxuM10,6.07,6.43,  you are discussing that will be completely distracting and it will be completely inappropriate,No
,,,  of course people will be looking forward towards looking such picture but then the complete,
,,,  message will be lost and people in fact will be laughing at you for using such inappropriate,
,,,  picture so what is the purpose of visuals visuals illustrate key point,
,,,  so it 's very easy to show a picture a it is said a picture is worth thousand word,
,,,  instead of describing something in so many word just show them a picture ok it will,
JF_m8AhkxuM11,6.49,7.27,  illustrate key point picture can also be used to reinforce verbal message you say something,No
,,,  you show it to them in the form of a visual it can be used to stimulate audience interest,
,,,  so you want to introduce a new concept to some people who have no idea of what is that,
,,,  so you can first show them the picture you can ask them what is this can you make a guess,
,,,  what is the function why should we use this you can stimulate audience interest and in,
,,,  time when the presentation becomes monotonous then you show them a visual so that attention,
JF_m8AhkxuM12,7.34,8.11,  will be focused so you can focus audience attention using a visual so these are the,No
,,,  four important purpose for which we use visuals but what kind of guideline you should be,
,,,  following when you want to use visuals so power point itself is a kind of visual you,
,,,  are using and then i talk about long sentence all that i am just looking at even the word,
,,,  which are written in the form of visual because we are just showing to the audience,
,,,  so when you use power point particularly dont use long sentence ok instead of using,
JF_m8AhkxuM13,8.19,8.59,  long sentence use bullet and take only keywords and phrase use appropriate font size some,No
,,,  ah place you need to show twenty four font size at least in certain case it will be,
,,,  twenty eight title sometimes are even about twenty eight thirty six ok transitional headline,
,,,  are between twenty eight thirty two but twelve fourteen they are ok for reading but not in,
,,,  term of showing them on power point especially when the audience are likely to be larger,
,,,  bigger and then they are likely to sit at the at end so you need to check whether they,
JF_m8AhkxuM14,9.04,9.39,  will be able to see the font size so you need to go to the venue and identify how big is,No
,,,  that and how can they easily look at your presentation and see even from the last row,
,,,  the next thing is appropriate color so suppose you are ah going to show them something in,
,,,  day light ok and then you are just ah using light color ok yellow light yellow and then,
,,,  light pink on the background so they will not be able to see you need to use for instant,
,,,  dark blue and yellow in term of font so they will be see the difference so it should be,
JF_m8AhkxuM15,9.45,10.2,  contrastive when you are showing it in daylight ok,No
,,,  so keep appropriate color so that they are able to see the font clearly and when you,
,,,  use slide in power pint spell check every slide any spelling mistake that go in the,
,,,  power point is owned by you you can not say that your friend or secretary or student typed,
,,,  and make that error in fact now a day a you type so good software will underline,
,,,  the spelling mistake and then you can correct it even when you type it so do not show any,
JF_m8AhkxuM16,10.25,11.02,  slide any visual with spelling mistake check visibility even by going towards the end and,No
,,,  then identifying the length of the room when you show the visual ok even if it is power,
,,,  point speak to the audience dont look at the visual and then talk ok dont do that so speck,
,,,  to the audience stop talking when making adjustment to the equipment so sometimes visuals are,
,,,  shown in core over head projector so you take one and put another one sometimes even power,
,,,  point sometimes you have to do something to move it so when you are doing it dont talk,
JF_m8AhkxuM17,11.09,11.43,  dont look at ah visual and talk all the time look at the audience and try to talk,No
,,,  the other important thing is one let u say you are showing a visual either you are displaying,
,,,  it or you are putting it on the o h p and then they are able to see that now you are,
,,,  discussing you are put the picture or map or something and then the audience are looking,
,,,  at it now once you have made a point and the visual is in term of connection is not to,
,,,  be shown any more just remove it and change the visual a the topic change do not leave,
JF_m8AhkxuM18,11.5,12.18,  it for a long time because it loses it 's relevant and audience will also lose interest in your,No
,,,  talk because they will just look at the visual and they will feel that you are just still,
,,,  continuing with the same ah thought in term of visuals but in term of verbal you have,
,,,  moved to something else so do not confuse them and they will ah feel,
,,,  the monotony do not leave visual slide too long so even if you can not change it dont,
,,,  just leave it so close it keep it away and then continue with your talk so the audience,
JF_m8AhkxuM19,12.24,12.59,  attention is focus towards your speech not on the visual and if you are going to use,No
,,,  power point they or any kind of visual to move one after another who will do that you,
,,,  are doing it somebody will do ah who is going to display that will you do that or somebody,
,,,  will keep changing it so identify who is going to do that even sometimes you can show video,
,,,  that is also part of visuals so pictorial representation of something animated version,
,,,  but are you taking somebody help or are you going to do that in case you have to do,
JF_m8AhkxuM20,13.04,13.35,  plan how you are going to do do not waste the audience time ok and minimize this time,No
,,,  taken for adjustment and all that when you use other supporting material in,
,,,  the form of visuals ask this question are they visible in the back row you can even,
,,,  ask them if it is not visible if you can take it out and circulate that is also fine ok,
,,,  are you can tell them to come to the front or you need to enlarge the size if possible,
,,,  also ask whether it is relevant your presentation a i said showing ah thing which are attractive,
JF_m8AhkxuM21,13.44,14.15,  but not relevant a nothing to do with your presentation you will also lose effectiveness,No
,,,  in term of giving a presentation ask the question whether the supporting material,
,,,  are short so they do not distract the audience too much from the oral portion of the presentation,
,,,  if the ah visual part is longer so audience are likely to get distracted ask again whether,
,,,  it is well timed in relation to your presentation is it coming appropriately at the right moment,
,,,  or it is coming wrongly so that you need to ah ensured now watch out,
JF_m8AhkxuM22,14.25,15,  avoid complicated derivation look at the one that i am showing you nobody i i dont know,No
,,,  even a math teacher or somebody who is so good in ah theorem and all that we will be,
,,,  able to just take a quick look and understand what is the purpose of showing this visuals,
,,,  should not make the audience use a microscope and check or use detective work and identify,
,,,  what is this and then dont do this thing visuals are just correlating they are just adding,
,,,  so dont confuse dont distract dont make it a complicated one such a this by using a,
JF_m8AhkxuM23,15.07,15.39,  derivation this is a wrong way to use visual and when you do that there are certain thing,No
,,,  you need to watch out for standing in a position where you obscure the screen especially standing,
,,,  before the ah ah projector and the screen and then your shadow false and audience could,
,,,  not see and then they tell you could you please move could you please move so that again will,
,,,  be a distractive one and then you showed some picture and then you are lost in the picture,
,,,  and you completely got digressed so getting lost in digression is something that you,
JF_m8AhkxuM24,15.45,16.15,  should watch out for moving about too much so visual is here so,No
,,,  you keep coming this side going this side that is also an unnecessary distraction so,
,,,  when you do this keep an eye on the audience body language are they feeling restless are,
,,,  they so involved immersed in what you are showing so depending on the their body language,
,,,  you can decide whether you want to show it longer whether you want to continue with that,
,,,  or you should change your strategy is it the time to stop and tell them a joke so that,
JF_m8AhkxuM25,16.22,16.56,  they come back or is it the time to show them additional visuals because they are more interested,No
,,,  in that so keep an eye on the audience body language which will tell you whether they,
,,,  are really trusted your visuals or they are getting disinterested,
,,,  now towards the end that is after using learning how to use all these ah visuals keep in mind,
,,,  some presentation practicality especially if you are a very un matured inexperienced,
,,,  presenter and if you are going and giving the presentation somewhere abroad in a different,
JF_m8AhkxuM26,17.03,17.51,  place within india in a conference in a seminar ok you been invited and you are going and,No
,,,  giving a presentation and you are using a power point ok try to send that file in advance,
,,,  ok e mail the file in advance if if the file is too large at least convert that so in the,
,,,  form of p d f and then again you can send it so you can use any method but then try,
,,,  to send it that dont just rest and then relax and think that oh i have now sent the file,
,,,  so i dont have to carry anything with me that is a risky proposition because you should,
JF_m8AhkxuM27,17.58,18.35,  ensure first of all whether it a reach properly but there is a possibility that ah it dint,No
,,,  reach them some virus wa there on the computer so the e mail got lost so e mail could not,
,,,  be retract the file could not open any issue can happen so this is just a stand by but,
,,,  you should keep a hard copy copy in the form of transparency if possible and you should,
,,,  also if possible keep your own ah ah p p t in a pen drive if possible keep that in a,
,,,  disk if it is a long one get it return in the d v d or copy it again in the pen drive,
JF_m8AhkxuM28,18.41,19.15,  in some case if you want specific font and some medium when you take it to another computer,No
,,,  it may not be using the same font because the version may be different and it may be,
,,,  the operating system may be different so you need to have some compatibility so it 's better,
,,,  that you carry it with you and then send something in advance just a ah [ sa/stand ] stand by and,
,,,  when you reach the venue go experience a venue and then check whether it is working on the,
,,,  computer before the audience would come ok get some time go there ah ten fifteen minute,
JF_m8AhkxuM29,19.21,19.58,  before check it and whichever laptop or computer you are going to use and the l c d projector,No
,,,  that you are going to use check whether it is getting connected and check the entire,
,,,  presentation whether it is flowing freely smoothly without any ah kick up ok without,
,,,  any hindrance this mean you take a quick rehearsal even before others come in the computer,
,,,  that is meant for your presentation now if you ensure this you will also be very confident,
,,,  when you are going to give the presentation how will you organize your presentation so,
JF_m8AhkxuM30,20.04,20.41,  some quick tip on organizing strategy for your presentation one way is to use the chronological,Structure
,,,  method that is starting from history so seventeen century this happen eighteen century this,
,,,  happen nineteen century this happen twentieth century and correctly this is what i am anticipating,
,,,  and twenty first century this is likely to happen chronological or you can simply say,
,,,  so ah certain aspect of how something will behave in a week so it happens on monday this,
,,,  way tuesday like this wednesday like this so and you can give chronological in term,
JF_m8AhkxuM31,20.47,21.19,  of history in term of date the first thing come first you can also use problem caused,No
,,,  solution method so this mean you want to say that people are so much affected by the,
,,,  problem of pollution now what cause pollution and where it is,
,,,  causing so you can say that air pollution water pollution so there are so many other,
,,,  type of pollution but you can say i am restricting my talk to these two type of pollution what,
,,,  are the agent which cause pollution so that is cause and what are the solution that you,
JF_m8AhkxuM32,21.26,22.03,  can give so problem pollution what is causing it and what could be the solution you can,No
,,,  also use this pro and con so for and against advantage disadvantage merit 's demerit 's,
,,,  good point bad point so this method is also nice especially if you want to show contrast,
,,,  compare two thing and then make the audience understand which one is better than the other,
,,,  the other simple method which i said at the beginning of ah the presentation lecture the,
,,,  sequential method one two three so i am going to talk about four important issue firstly,
JF_m8AhkxuM33,22.11,22.49,  or first in four most secondly thirdly and finally to conclude or even fourthly and then,No
,,,  you conclude so the sequential model so these are the conventionally used one that help,
,,,  the audience to understand that you are able to deliver it in a coherent manner but remember,
,,,  to give that effective presentation that will get you that standing ovation you need to,
,,,  practice practice practice the more you practice the more effective you will become the more,
,,,  confident you will deliver in the content the more effective your body language will,
JF_m8AhkxuM34,22.54,23.3,  also become now before i conclude this module let me give,No
,,,  you some final tip over all tip on presentation skill a such a you become a professional,
,,,  a you become an expert speaker try to use topic from your own experience initially,
,,,  prepare topic which are from ah so many book and material which are readily available,
,,,  for example internet is it a bane or boom technology is it a bane or boom so modern,
,,,  invention talk about computer and so on so readymade topic are available so you can,
JF_m8AhkxuM35,23.36,24.09,  memorize that and then give small talk but a you become a professional and then instead,No
,,,  of waiting for people to give you topic you try to use topic from your own experience,
,,,  you volunteer and you tell them i have walked on this topic this area which many people,
,,,  are not familiar with and i would like to give a lecture small talk on this topic and,
,,,  when you do that you also try to develop narrative skill how do you develop narrative skill,
,,,  it 's just like telling a story and try to in fact tell story to your friend to your,
JF_m8AhkxuM36,24.16,24.49,  colleague to your family member and that will enhance your narrative skill,No
,,,  so you would plan what should be said at the begging middle and end if there is a suspense,
,,,  story you know when to break the suspense how to build it so that is narrative skill,
,,,  so try to develop that the art of telling somebody something reporting in the form of,
,,,  telling a story whenever you get a chance ensure that you will always give a talk only,
,,,  if you have an objective never speck without the purpose ok do not give useless meaningless,
JF_m8AhkxuM37,24.57,25.33,  talk that is the easiest way to become unpopular and the audience will start hating you running,No
,,,  away from you speak only with a purpose and when you build up and argument in your talk,
,,,  so when your arguing in favor against something use interesting example ok so the more interesting,
,,,  it will be in the better audience will able to remember them connect them with personal,
,,,  anecdote tell how you can relate it to you what happens in your personal life how can,
,,,  you relate to this one the way you relate many other people will be able to relate to,
JF_m8AhkxuM38,25.38,26.21,  your personal experience and then they will be able to understand that better use funny,No
,,,  fact ok in fact what i imply by this is use humor occasional humor occasional sense of,
,,,  humor will make the audience break the monotony in fact even in interview ok if you can use,
,,,  if you can given intelligent joke and if you can make the people in the interview panel,
,,,  laugh ok so you can almost be sure that you are getting the job because that will make,
,,,  them look at an another aspect of you which generally they have ignored and same thing,
JF_m8AhkxuM39,26.28,27.01,  with presentation also when you use humor so they thought that you are a very serious,No
,,,  speaker your are a very ah ah serious scientist and then a researcher you are giving very,
,,,  serious idea but suddenly you go off track slightly give a funny fact funny anecdote,
,,,  so that will make people relate to you in a better manner ok having said this last two,
,,,  point in term of overall communication you need to communicate clearly if there is no,
,,,  mike and then your confronted in a situation you have to give it talk project your voice,
JF_m8AhkxuM40,27.07,27.45,  which mean you need to speak a little more loudly a if you are acting before them a,No
,,,  if you are on a stage and then those day if you remember there were no microphone,
,,,  so the actor have to shout ok so imagine that you have to speak more loudly then normal,
,,,  but it will be un usual at first but your audience wont notice because in fact raising,
,,,  your voice is something that will make the audience focus to you ok there are speaker,
,,,  who raise their voice speak so loud so that they even ensure that nobody in the audience,
JF_m8AhkxuM41,27.52,28.22,  can sleep it is so loud they they can not sleep in that loud noise ok,No
,,,  but the point i am make is it should be loud enough so they are able to hear it clearly,
,,,  but if you speak softly so they will notice that why ah this person is specking so soft,
,,,  i am not able to hear only to the people who are sitting in the first row it is audible,
,,,  then they become restless and then they get distracted and they thing which you do not,
,,,  want them to do communicating clearly on the one hand but communicating effectively overall,
JF_m8AhkxuM42,28.32,29.11,  is the most important objective of delivering ah public speech or oral presentation remember,No
,,,  there is no point in giving a presentation that the audience can not understand so if,
,,,  it go above their height or if it is too low or you are making it complicated a you,
,,,  very well know there are some people who use very complex ah vocabulary so that even a,
,,,  simple idea becomes very difficult for you to understand but there are others that i,
,,,  want you to follow who even take a very complex idea difficult subject but they use simple,
JF_m8AhkxuM43,29.19,29.58,  thought simple expression and then they find simple way of convincing you to understand,No
,,,  that and that is the method you should follow so that the audience can understand you fully,
,,,  and effectively ok so if you can do this and keep this in mind,
,,,  you will definitely become that popular speaker and finally when you give a talk enjoy yourself,
,,,  great psychologist like ibrahim maslow they say that in our life we have opportunity,
,,,  for peak experience high tent experience one of the high tent peak experience that,
JF_m8AhkxuM44,30.09,30.44,  you can get is the speech that you deliver before audience the larger the number the,No
,,,  greater your peak experience so when you experience that peak form of ah your performance enjoy,
,,,  yourself when you are enjoy yourself giving the talk the audience will also enjoy your,
,,,  performance and then be creative i have given you lot of suggestion but then try to break,
,,,  away even if you think that you can do better than what i have said ok and if somebody tell,
,,,  you this is the way it should be done but if you think creatively and if you feel that,
JF_m8AhkxuM45,30.49,31.22,  if it can be done this way it is still better do that be creative and when you slowly develop,No
,,,  yourself in term of ah oral presentation and public speech develop your own style the,
,,,  your own style of narrating thing your own style of telling joke your own style of presentation,
,,,  your own style of preparing slide so make your style and then what will have is soon,
,,,  you will have your own fan people will like your own unique style initially you will be,
,,,  bit embarrass bit shy thinking that can i really do this but just do what come naturally,
JF_m8AhkxuM46,31.29,32.04,  into you so that may be your real inner talent and talk out that potential and you will have,No
,,,  your own fan and you will get that standing ovation that i been telling you to visualize,
,,,  right from the beginning now the last concluding thought after talking to you so much about,
,,,  presentation skill i have given you enough input but ah look at the famous quote from,
,,,  this ah martial art super star ah bruce lee he say that knowing is not enough so now,
,,,  you know everything about public speaking but that knowing is not enough we must apply,
JF_m8AhkxuM47,32.14,32.51,  you must use it in your presentation willing is not enough ok your willing to do this you,No
,,,  wish to do this that is not enough we must do what doe it mean suppose you dont know,
,,,  how to swim you go to the library and read ton of book thousand of book on swimming,
,,,  you have read but i ask you did you ever go to the swimming,
,,,  fool you say no did you ever jumped in to the water in the swimming fool you say no,
,,,  do you understand you must do it reading hundred of book on swimming will not help you you,
JF_m8AhkxuM48,32.59,33.36,  have read twenty hundred book on how to ride a bicycle but you are afraid of sitting on,No
,,,  the seat and then ah holding the handle bar so how will you learn cycling the same thing,
,,,  go with public speaking speaking any communication related issue it 's an art you need to develop,
,,,  it you will develop it only by practice ah and any amount of knowledge that i give you,
,,,  is not going to be enough a i said at the beginning of ah the lecture the purpose of,
,,,  ah these video the purpose of ah my lecture particularly is not to ah help you just get,
JF_m8AhkxuM50,33.43,34.39,  a certificate and display to people just do all this assignment but beyond this certificate,No
,,,  and assignment have you learnt something from this and learning in that sense ha it done,
,,,  something to you your thinking your believe change in your behavior have you taken one,
,,,  step ok and then have you followed it up by taking more step that is what is meant by,
,,,  willing is not enough we must do do it practice it become very trained professional public,
,,,  speaker do not have any fear for oral presentation embrace any chance jump at any chance use,
,,,  all the tip i have given very soon you will also become a very effective communicator,
,,,  in term of oral presentation wish you all the best thank you for watching this video,
,,,  have a nice day,
ivaja7-MprQ1,0,0.11,  hi everyone kevin here today i want to,No
,,,  show you how you can use,
,,,  presenter view in microsoft powerpoint,
,,,  when you 're presenting in,
,,,  microsoft team what is presenter view,
,,,  well there are three,
ivaja7-MprQ2,0.12,0.21,  advantage of using presenter view the,No
,,,  first one is,
,,,  you get note alongside your slide so,
,,,  let 's say that you have a big,
,,,  presentation coming up at work,
,,,  or maybe you 're a teacher presenting to,
ivaja7-MprQ3,0.23,0.31,  your class and you want to make sure,No
,,,  that you hit certain point,
,,,  with the note you can make sure you,
,,,  cover all the point that you want to,
,,,  cover,
,,,  on that slide also you see what 's coming,
ivaja7-MprQ4,0.34,0.43,  up next in your slide presentation,No
,,,  i do n't know how many presentation i 've,
,,,  been in where the presenter ha been,
,,,  flustered by the next slide that appears,
,,,  you do n't have to let that happen,
,,,  anymore and lastly,
ivaja7-MprQ5,0.45,0.54,  with presenter view you get access to a,No
,,,  whole bunch of annotation tool,
,,,  for instance you could pull up a pen you,
,,,  could pull up a highlighter a laser,
,,,  pointer,
,,,  to make your presentation more dynamic,
ivaja7-MprQ6,0.57,1.05,  now i 'm going to show you how to use,No
,,,  presenter view even if you just have,
,,,  a single monitor it 's really easy to,
,,,  pull up this should be a really quick,
,,,  tutorial,
,,,  and why do n't we jump on the pc and i 'll,
ivaja7-MprQ7,1.08,1.16,  show you how to do it,No
,,,  here i am on my pc and i have microsoft,
,,,  team,
,,,  open coming up later today i have an,
,,,  extremely,
,,,  important meeting where i 'm going to be,
ivaja7-MprQ8,1.18,1.28,  pitching the kevin cookie company to,No
,,,  investor i 'm trying to raise some fund,
,,,  for the kevin cookie company so we could,
,,,  expand our location,
,,,  now anytime i talk to investor i get,
,,,  really nervous because our,
ivaja7-MprQ9,1.29,1.38,  company really depends on being able to,No
,,,  raise these fund,
,,,  now when i 'm presenting being able to,
,,,  see note being able to see what slide,
,,,  are coming up next,
,,,  that 'll really help me deliver a more,
ivaja7-MprQ10,1.4,1.49,  confident presentation,No
,,,  and if i could use annotation tool a,
,,,  well i think it 'll also make it a more,
,,,  dynamic presentation so presenter view,
,,,  will be very very helpful here,
,,,  i 'm going to go ahead and let me click,
ivaja7-MprQ11,1.51,1.59,  on this meeting and i 'm going to test it,No
,,,  out to make sure,
,,,  i could get into presenter view and to,
,,,  make sure everything work a i expect,
,,,  it to,
,,,  emily on my team ha volunteered to help,
ivaja7-MprQ12,2.01,2.1,  me test it,No
,,,  this way you 'll be able to see what my,
,,,  screen look like a the presenter and,
,,,  you 'll also be able to see what it look,
,,,  like from an attendee 's perspective,
,,,  using emily let me go ahead and join,
ivaja7-MprQ13,2.12,2.22,  this meeting,No
,,,  i 've now joined the meeting and i can,
,,,  see that emily is already in the meeting,
,,,  hey emily how 's it going doing great,
,,,  kevin how are you,
,,,  yes once again the kevin youtube channel,
ivaja7-MprQ14,2.24,2.34,  is smaller than you 'd expect,No
,,,  it 's only me so here within the,
,,,  microsoft team meeting to be able to,
,,,  use presenter view well first off i need,
,,,  to share,
,,,  or present some content so up here i,
ivaja7-MprQ15,2.36,2.46,  have all of my meeting control and,No
,,,  the one that i 'm interested in is the,
,,,  one where i could open my share tray so,
,,,  let me go ahead and open that up,
,,,  now you see all these different item,
,,,  that i could share,
ivaja7-MprQ16,2.47,2.55,  now there are three different way you,No
,,,  could share a powerpoint presentation,
,,,  but only one of them,
,,,  will bring up the presenter view so,
,,,  choose wisely,
,,,  over here on the left hand side i could,
ivaja7-MprQ17,2.57,3.07,  simply share my entire desktop,No
,,,  however when i share my entire desktop,
,,,  if i shift into presenter view,
,,,  my attendee will also see that i 'm in,
,,,  presenter view and that 's not what i,
,,,  want,
ivaja7-MprQ18,3.08,3.17,  i want to see presenter view and i want,No
,,,  my attendee to just see the slide,
,,,  so if you chose desktop this is not the,
,,,  right path,
,,,  there 's also another option on the right,
,,,  hand side where you can upload a,
ivaja7-MprQ19,3.19,3.27,  powerpoint presentation,No
,,,  to microsoft team and you could present,
,,,  that way,
,,,  now that get you part of the way there,
,,,  because your attendee will just see the,
,,,  slide,
ivaja7-MprQ20,3.28,3.35,  you 'll see the slide and you 'll also be,No
,,,  able to pull up note alongside your,
,,,  slide,
,,,  however the note wo n't be via presenter,
,,,  view,
,,,  the only way that we could show and see,
ivaja7-MprQ21,3.37,3.46,  presenter view,No
,,,  is if we go ahead and share the,
,,,  powerpoint presentation window,
,,,  so this is the right path if we want to,
,,,  use presenter view so let 's go ahead and,
,,,  share the powerpoint presentation window,
ivaja7-MprQ22,3.49,4,  this brings up a powerpoint presentation,No
,,,  and right now i 'm sharing the entire,
,,,  window if we look over at,
,,,  emily 's screen what you 'll see is right,
,,,  now she see everything that i see so,
,,,  she see all the powerpoint chrome,
ivaja7-MprQ23,4.02,4.12,  she see the slide sorter on the left,No
,,,  hand side and then she see the slide in,
,,,  the center of,
,,,  the screen we want to get it into,
,,,  presenter mode and to do that,
,,,  first off we have to kick off the,
ivaja7-MprQ24,4.14,4.22,  presentation there are a few different,No
,,,  way we could do that,
,,,  up here on the ribbon if we click into,
,,,  slideshow you can start a presentation,
,,,  from the beginning,
,,,  or you could press the f5 key a the,
ivaja7-MprQ25,4.24,4.34,  shortcut you could also start from the,No
,,,  current slide the shortcut for that,
,,,  is shift and f5 and then also down here,
,,,  in the bottom right hand corner you,
,,,  could also click on this,
,,,  icon to start the presentation so let 's,
ivaja7-MprQ26,4.36,4.47,  go ahead i 'm going to press f5 i 'm a big,No
,,,  fan of shortcut key it make life,
,,,  easier and quicker so let 's go ahead and,
,,,  kick off this presentation,
,,,  so this drop me on the first slide of,
,,,  the presentation and right now if we,
ivaja7-MprQ27,4.48,4.58,  look at emily,No
,,,  she see exactly what i see we 're in,
,,,  just the standard presentation mode,
,,,  now i want to bring up presenter view on,
,,,  my screen so,
,,,  one way to do that is here on the slide,
ivaja7-MprQ28,5,5.09,  i 'm going to right click with my mouse,No
,,,  and then i see an option that say show,
,,,  presenter view i 'm going to go ahead and,
,,,  click on that,
,,,  now you 'll see on my screen this pull,
,,,  up presenter view,
ivaja7-MprQ29,5.1,5.2,  and right here in the middle of,No
,,,  presenter view i see the slide that,
,,,  currently all of my attendee can see,
,,,  it 's the largest one and probably the,
,,,  most important one because this is,
,,,  what 's being broadcast out to my,
ivaja7-MprQ30,5.21,5.3,  attendee,No
,,,  over on the right hand side i see the,
,,,  next slide that 's coming up so this way,
,,,  i wo n't be caught off guard,
,,,  by the content that 's coming up next,
,,,  once again it 's surprising to see how,
ivaja7-MprQ31,5.32,5.4,  many people are thrown off by what 's,No
,,,  coming up next,
,,,  probably ha to do with collaborating,
,,,  with other people on slide someone,
,,,  insert a slide and you forgot that it,
,,,  wa there down here in the bottom right,
ivaja7-MprQ32,5.42,5.5,  hand corner,No
,,,  this is where i see all of my slide,
,,,  note so this way a i 'm presenting this,
,,,  slide i 'll remember here in this case,
,,,  that i wanted to share an example of a,
,,,  co,
ivaja7-MprQ33,5.51,6.01,  who used this during her presentation,No
,,,  when i speak to this slide i could bring,
,,,  up that point,
,,,  now along with seeing my note down here,
,,,  i have all of my different tool that i,
,,,  could use while presenting,
ivaja7-MprQ34,6.02,6.11,  so i have thing like a pen a laser,No
,,,  pointer i could zoom in i could turn the,
,,,  screen white or black,
,,,  i have lot of different tool i could,
,,,  even turn on subtitle or caption along,
,,,  with my slide,
ivaja7-MprQ35,6.12,6.23,  and then i could advance to the next,No
,,,  slide or return to a previous slide,
,,,  so i have lot of different tool here,
,,,  now if we look over at emily 's display,
,,,  you 'll see in emily 's display that she,
,,,  continues to only see the slide,
ivaja7-MprQ36,6.25,6.34,  so even though amin present her view,No
,,,  emily continues to just see the slide,
,,,  so this way she doe n't see all my note,
,,,  she doe n't see all the different tool,
,,,  that i have,
,,,  and our view are now separated let me,
ivaja7-MprQ37,6.36,6.46,  go ahead and end the slideshow and i,No
,,,  want to show you,
,,,  one other way to get into presenter view,
,,,  so you do n't have to first kick it off,
,,,  into full screen presentation and then,
,,,  shift it,
ivaja7-MprQ38,6.47,7,  instead what we can do is when we 're on,No
,,,  the main view here within powerpoint,
,,,  if you press the alt key with the f5 key,
,,,  at the same time that 'll launch u,
,,,  directly into presenter view,
,,,  now if you remember when we hovered over,
ivaja7-MprQ39,7.02,7.15,  from the beginning the shortcut key wa,No
,,,  f5 all we do is we combine that now with,
,,,  the alt key,
,,,  and so let 's press alt f5 when i press,
,,,  alt f5 this drop u immediately in,
,,,  the presenter view and once again i 'm,
ivaja7-MprQ40,7.17,7.25,  going to pull up emily 's screen and,No
,,,  emily just see the slide that we 're,
,,,  presenting,
,,,  and she doe not see the presenter view,
,,,  now that we 're back in the main,
,,,  powerpoint view the f5 key ha lot of,
ivaja7-MprQ41,7.27,7.35,  different way that you can use it,No
,,,  if you want to just start the,
,,,  presentation from the first slide or the,
,,,  very beginning you hit f5,
,,,  if you want to start from the current,
,,,  slide you press shift f5,
ivaja7-MprQ42,7.37,7.47,  and if you want to drop directly in,No
,,,  presenter view you press alt,
,,,  f5 so combining f5 with a number of,
,,,  other key,
,,,  you have power and control over how you,
,,,  want to kick off your presentation,
ivaja7-MprQ43,7.49,7.57,  now that 's how we get into presenter,No
,,,  view i also wanted to,
,,,  do a quick call out for another youtube,
,,,  video that i did that 's also,
,,,  very helpful when you 're presenting in,
,,,  powerpoint and,
ivaja7-MprQ44,7.59,8.07,  i have a link to this in description i,No
,,,  have a link to the video i also have a,
,,,  link to the deck,
,,,  but within this deck i call out a whole,
,,,  bunch of different shortcut key,
,,,  that you can use while you 're presenting,
ivaja7-MprQ45,8.09,8.18,  in powerpoint so,No
,,,  all of these different way make it,
,,,  easier and make your presentation,
,,,  more dynamic a you 're presenting it all,
,,,  right well that wa a quick tutorial,
,,,  showing you how you can get into,
ivaja7-MprQ46,8.2,8.29,  presenter view in microsoft powerpoint,No
,,,  while you 're presenting in microsoft,
,,,  team,

,,,  use presenter view please give this,
,,,  video a thumb up,

,,,  of with your name duck in excitement,
,,,  here 's what 's going to happen today i,
,,,  will talk to you about presentation aid,
,,,  and then i will talk to you briefly,
rvIfl5Q66T02,0.15,0.31,  about the upcoming presentation and,Structure
,,,  then I will leave some room for,
,,,  question because this is the last time,
,,,  you hear from me we 're done but the rest,
,,,  is guest lecture and your presentation,
,,,  so at any point today while I 'm talking,
rvIfl5Q66T03,0.34,0.47,  you have some question that arise about,Structure
,,,  structure about presentation aid about,
,,,  audience about any of the thing that I,
,,,  talk to you about revive any other,
,,,  issue that you might have with,
,,,  presentation please ask me and of,
rvIfl5Q66T04,0.49,0.59,  course I 'm going to be here still and,Structure
,,,  we 're going to have lecture and,
,,,  everything but I 'm just letting you know,
,,,  that a far a me sharing the knowledge,
,,,  with you wind up that 's all the,
,,,  knowledge I hope you remember let 's not,
rvIfl5Q66T05,1.03,1.35,  speaking of distraction that is good to,No
,,,  know,
,,,  okay before we move on you guy have any,
,,,  question from the get about,
,,,  structural to the last time a lot of,
,,,  time with maybe you might like to switch,
rvIfl5Q66T06,1.39,1.58,  the order of our presentation to tear,No
,,,  presentation to the general public to,
,,,  tear when the first that supposed to go,
,,,  are you doing,
,,,  to what we understand a made people,
,,,  across each other,
rvIfl5Q66T07,1.59,2.28,  and when he changed you need more simple,No
,,,  Oh s cool so our presentation were not,
,,,  academic become better that way learn,
,,,  something useful about like how how much,
,,,  of the content is accessible long,
,,,  specialist and maybe attachment very,
rvIfl5Q66T08,2.31,2.47,  deep with other artist I visit me at,No
,,,  all clear of initiative next five side,
,,,  there,
,,,  that 's right,
,,,  I see I see where the idea is coming,
,,,  from I do that 's exactly what I do n't,
rvIfl5Q66T09,2.49,3.03,  want you guy to do oh I want a barrier,No
,,,  presentation with your audience very,
,,,  specifically in mind I do n't want you to,
,,,  take the presentation you already have,
,,,  let 's prepare for academic and cut it I,
,,,  want you to think completely from the,
rvIfl5Q66T010,3.07,3.19,  scratch about talking about what you do,No
,,,  to people who do n't know what you have,
,,,  there wa kind of the idea i invisible,
,,,  because remember on the last lecture and,
,,,  I can totally see where you 're coming,
,,,  from because first of all it make you,
rvIfl5Q66T011,3.22,3.35,  work blessed because you 've never done,Structure
,,,  you know how would be hurt you and the,
,,,  second thing is in c20 good sequence the,
,,,  thing is about all the insurgent and,
,,,  transcends and why I wa talking so much,
,,,  about think who exactly you 're talking,
rvIfl5Q66T012,3.38,3.51,  to when you 're preparing the,Structure
,,,  presentation I 'm hoping even your,
,,,  structure when you talk to academic,
,,,  person on academic I 'm thinking your,
,,,  emphasis will hopefully be completely,
,,,  different maybe even your main point,
rvIfl5Q66T013,3.53,4.05,  only different because like for instance,No
,,,  when we talk about I 'm thinking about,
,,,  his research and I 'm thinking if she,
,,,  talk to people who have no idea what,
,,,  she 's doing she 's going to have to,
,,,  normally cut it in half word one third,
rvIfl5Q66T014,4.08,4.2,  or fifth or powder she 's going to change,No
,,,  Cavallari she 's going to have to change,
,,,  the way she talk about stuff because,
,,,  remember what we see when we look up is,
,,,  completely something different than they,
,,,  see it completely we call it different,
rvIfl5Q66T015,4.22,4.37,  name because we do n't know I say you,No
,,,  are just like we 're talking no longer it,
,,,  right she 's going to have two different,
,,,  presentation and I 'm hoping that 's,
,,,  what 's going to happen with you guy too,
,,,  they usually have to ask yourself kind,
rvIfl5Q66T016,4.39,4.52,  of from a different angle now I should,No
,,,  talk about it I 'm how many people who,
,,,  really do n't know what I 'm talking about,
,,,  doe that make a little more sense if,
,,,  I 'm able to like explain why I beg your,
,,,  life my hope is that having these two,
rvIfl5Q66T017,4.57,5.12,  presentation is not oh one thing is,No
,,,  that you need,
,,,  but also that you husband and that you,
,,,  can take and use summer so you do n't,
,,,  have never been easy hopefully you,
,,,  dueces read up on it that you can then,
rvIfl5Q66T018,5.14,5.31,  go maybe take it to you know I I school,No
,,,  area or like for me I work a campground,
,,,  basically and they have education,
,,,  program maybe I can take my patient,
,,,  like service so maybe see that in mind,
,,,  you 're prepared,
rvIfl5Q66T019,5.33,5.47,  not only you 're doing to this class but,No
,,,  how you use it outside the classroom you,
,,,  or you want to be a guest lecturer and,
,,,  courtesan community college and you 're,
,,,  talking to people for just starting or,
,,,  maybe thinking about graduate school you,
rvIfl5Q66T020,5.49,6,  do n't want to scare them but you do what,No
,,,  I presented in a way that 's very,
,,,  accessible and if the same time very,
,,,  interesting that 's that 's very good,
,,,  example you might want to use something,
,,,  that and that hopefully will be,
rvIfl5Q66T021,6.03,6.16,  completely different than something you,Structure
,,,  will present in your apartment in front,
,,,  of your pc advisor in front of for a,
,,,  conference in from your peer so it 's,
,,,  like I 'm thinking different completely,
,,,  different different structure may be,
rvIfl5Q66T022,6.18,6.29,  differing point different approach we,No
,,,  do n't want to hear this and presentation,
,,,  place and I 'm letting mention it because,
,,,  it 's a good way to think about it too a,
,,,  the bedroom there and how to make those,
,,,  Lewis my name is preparing a,
rvIfl5Q66T023,6.31,6.46,  presentation about a proposal,No
,,,  communication for Community College and,
,,,  I realize that even communication it 's,
,,,  something a people or you into this,
,,,  reputation we use certain word all the,
,,,  time that are very discipline specific,
rvIfl5Q66T024,6.5,7.02,  and I need to cut them all out in,No
,,,  champaign what wa it when I did n't know,
,,,  what it brilliant I just thought about,
,,,  this talking to people and communicating,
,,,  how do you do that and there 's a,
,,,  childhood fun do n't any other question,
rvIfl5Q66T025,7.07,7.22,  shoe please,No
,,,  okay presentation aid few thing I want,
,,,  to tell you about presentation aid um,
,,,  we use them of course constantly or we,
,,,  tend to think about what we think about,
,,,  presentation aid is PowerPoint I want,
rvIfl5Q66T026,7.24,7.38,  you to remember that is not the only,No
,,,  option there are other thing you can do,
,,,  that include audio visual aid that do,
,,,  not include power first and foremost,
,,,  thing that I want you to be prepared,
,,,  for when you are planning to use a,
rvIfl5Q66T027,7.4,7.58,  presentation age is be prepared for not,No
,,,  using it because if you have a,
,,,  presentation with a PowerPoint then we,
,,,  like to this PowerPoint so heavily that,
,,,  if you do n't have it reviewed it brings,
,,,  something that 's worth the projector,
rvIfl5Q66T028,7.59,8.16,  doe n't turn on the switch the cake will,No
,,,  be adapter the map versus the Norma that,
,,,  so whatever happened you need to be able,
,,,  to say something besides I 'm and that 's,
,,,  it and I 'm serious it happens a,
,,,  unlikely a you think it doe it happens,
rvIfl5Q66T029,8.19,8.33,  all the time thing do n't work computer,No
,,,  are match adapter known one adapt,
,,,  projector two thing have something to,
,,,  say besides I 'm sorry my friend point,
,,,  doe n't work and this is something that,
,,,  strongly encouraged have plan B always,
rvIfl5Q66T030,8.39,8.51,  so are you going to sneak attack u and,No
,,,  relentless in a fast,
,,,  it might a well happen in this class,
,,,  continue without mine that 's usually,
,,,  what happens to be honest with you I,
,,,  teach puppetry and I teach about me,
rvIfl5Q66T031,8.54,9.09,  speaking in different room but most,No
,,,  often in wellman and there are tool and,
,,,  while I try to teach probably and my,
,,,  opener always one oh nothing of it but,
,,,  I always tell student be prepared your,
,,,  random word that are overlooked and,
rvIfl5Q66T032,9.11,9.24,  everytime first round and informative,No
,,,  speech at least three people do n't get,
,,,  hurt originally I do n't know I do n't,
,,,  know if it aura I would know if it 's,
,,,  the machinery that already hurting so,
,,,  many time they kind of just reacts to,
rvIfl5Q66T033,9.26,9.39,  okay she 's yelling we work she 's not any,No
,,,  door I do n't know how it work but I,
,,,  kid you not pitch that work certain,
,,,  people 's cutback and it doe where,
,,,  certain people just like the computer,
,,,  and nothing in it I do n't know why,
rvIfl5Q66T034,9.41,9.52,  imagine it just happens so you do n't,No
,,,  want it might just a water with it I 'm,
,,,  going to do anything we 'll see but no be,
,,,  prepared for because it really doe,
,,,  happen and I goodness it 's plenty of,
,,,  time and if you have this one,
rvIfl5Q66T035,9.56,10.09,  opportunity this one conference this one,No
,,,  presentation just one time to do it you,
,,,  better be prepared to do so whatever you,
,,,  need is it you need to print your slide,
,,,  or you need to have an outline or you,
,,,  need to be able to explain thing and,
rvIfl5Q66T036,10.11,10.21,  hopefully you will be able to deliver,No
,,,  your presentation without saying so here,
,,,  i will show you this thing i 'm not going,
,,,  to show you which would be really good,
,,,  will help you but i am from it that 's,
,,,  not very helpful so try to have it let,
rvIfl5Q66T037,10.27,10.44,  me and this also might give everything,Structure
,,,  for you,
,,,  team with your attention if you know,
,,,  that word stop store you still prepared,
,,,  that is a very good another little,
,,,  technique to make yourself feel le,
rvIfl5Q66T038,10.46,11.04,  anxious because if you know that you 're,No
,,,  prepared even if thing do n't work that,
,,,  make you feel that extra cushion that,
,,,  make you feel extra a little more,
,,,  secure hopefully make sense okay second,
,,,  thing and not what the hell 's any other,
rvIfl5Q66T039,11.09,11.21,  you figger and I do n't receive many,No
,,,  time the person 's Thomas to the,
,,,  PowerPoint a dirty talking and talking,
,,,  other than part are showing or showing,
,,,  something will be different or justify,
,,,  and is no Lewis people take a look at,
rvIfl5Q66T040,11.24,11.38,  your key they look at the motor pool,No
,,,  and I this is not a joke and it 's funny,
,,,  now but this is not a job I wa I,
,,,  witness the presentation when something,
,,,  started burning in the lap of the room,
,,,  and people started leaving in the guy to,
rvIfl5Q66T041,11.4,11.54,  notice because when we do start when I,No
,,,  kid you not they got a staged reading of,
,,,  it power cord and people started,
,,,  leaving the room and get it noticed,
,,,  do n't talk to your PowerPoint I know,
,,,  you 're very proud of it any of a very,
rvIfl5Q66T042,11.56,12.08,  intimate relationship with your partner,No
,,,  it 's a great house but a lot of time,
,,,  preparing it do n't talk to it talk to,
,,,  your audience because nothing make,
,,,  worst impression than,
,,,  doe it so now we 're going to be talking,
rvIfl5Q66T043,12.11,12.22,  about my power point that I wrote and I,No
,,,  really like so I 'm going to look at you,
,,,  ever and I 'm going to be off my hard way,
,,,  after about 45 second of that you 're,
,,,  done you have no connection with me we,
,,,  have no eye contact you do n't listen to,
rvIfl5Q66T044,12.24,12.41,  me and you can lead we 're a snowman if,No
,,,  you really think that everything that,
,,,  you really have to say your present can,
,,,  be written on it than the water well for,
,,,  some reason we 're out there this is very,
,,,  important and this is not only to,
rvIfl5Q66T045,12.42,12.59,  powerpoint it 's for the board the poster,No
,,,  basically do n't talk to it talk to your,
,,,  kid remember that your audio visual aid,
,,,  is not for you it 's for the people who,
,,,  you talk to in his defense it wa a,
,,,  friendly big one that wo n't work thing,
rvIfl5Q66T046,13.01,13.18,  started burning so maybe you would you,No
,,,  want me what you can smell it but,
,,,  literally they become bigger the other,
,,,  thing when you think I on his way what,
,,,  do you think people use of influence why,
,,,  do we have powerpoints and presentation,
rvIfl5Q66T047,13.22,13.42,  because a lot of thing are easier,No
,,,  explain grafton paragraph of coffee and,
,,,  yet how often you see people paragraph,
,,,  and paragraph and paragraph on this,
,,,  life one again we 're in ecology you,
,,,  ca n't read why do we use part with them,
rvIfl5Q66T048,13.47,14.12,  no seriously like Wyatt life why do you,No
,,,  have other visual a superstitious person,
,,,  because medium I 'd what you know I,
,,,  sometimes use it because it 's bad and if,
,,,  I invite have a option to use now I a,
,,,  certain thing are better explained with,
rvIfl5Q66T049,14.14,14.35,  an audio visual aid my name is a explain,No
,,,  is one structuring,
,,,  and,
,,,  another way to clarify what you say,
,,,  mm that 's true other work what are,
,,,  some like number percentage,
rvIfl5Q66T050,14.38,14.56,  proportion it help to have a graph for,No
,,,  it,
,,,  and fasten what what having something,
,,,  a sort of cleaning way I almost like,
,,,  you 're questioning,
,,,  what patient do not require resolution,
rvIfl5Q66T051,15,15.12,  to make better and you can score a tough,Structure
,,,  you cut you have a folk singer whatever,
,,,  it wa telling a story and it 's part of,
,,,  the point of it to have audience and,
,,,  reservation and I 'm to you maybe,
,,,  occasionally design something faculty,
rvIfl5Q66T052,15.14,15.28,  here or whatever imagine my first,No
,,,  galaxy it 's weather but you know they,
,,,  think you 're trying to picture no okay,
,,,  we 're studying the ancient culture of,
,,,  Eurasia and there 's hill and valley,
,,,  and rice arm or clever that 's fine if,
rvIfl5Q66T053,15.32,15.49,  what 's required is just an impression or,Structure
,,,  in general,
,,,  if you really need to show exactly how,
,,,  the curve go there 's nothing,
,,,  yeah even if you could absolutely,
,,,  accurate,
rvIfl5Q66T054,15.54,16.07,  look at what house is good question,No
,,,  about audio visual aid and three,
,,,  example you gave me were physical,
,,,  picture something it 's easier to see,
,,,  something if we have a picture of it,
,,,  structuring our presentation and,
rvIfl5Q66T055,16.09,16.21,  visualizing certain concept like rat,No
,,,  are like proportion now that we 've,
,,,  established that these are all three,
,,,  good reason to use an artificial lake,
,,,  think about other visual link that,
,,,  you 've seen people use and that you use,
rvIfl5Q66T056,16.24,16.42,  how little do they have in common with,No
,,,  these three purpose why people feel the,
,,,  need to write their presentation on the,
,,,  slide why is it relevant doe it show a,
,,,  picture doe it show a brown or doe it,
,,,  show structure no it doe n't show either,
rvIfl5Q66T057,16.43,16.59,  it make you feel better that 's not the,No
,,,  point of artificial rain I want you to,
,,,  think about your other visual aid very,
,,,  in a very utilitarian way am I using it,
,,,  do I need it doe it help my,
,,,  presentation because if it doe n't do n't,
rvIfl5Q66T058,17.01,17.12,  like them cuz it doe n't make sense,No
,,,  really and I understand it in some,
,,,  context if you like okay I 'm gon na show,
,,,  up there without a PowerPoint that 's not,
,,,  gon na be professional that 's not going,
,,,  to make sense they do n't have,
rvIfl5Q66T059,17.13,17.28,  understanding have you ever seen so far,No
,,,  is there a very professional college,
,,,  setting am i coming to you about serious,
,,,  stuff do you know what I 'm talking to,
,,,  you how am I use PowerPoint one where,
,,,  we manage I did n't have to put every,
rvIfl5Q66T060,17.31,17.47,  single thing I say,No
,,,  right and you still got it three I need,
,,,  just break free from the end between I,
,,,  throw the horrible PowerPoint pressure,
,,,  because that 's what we do we we think,
,,,  that we can not go out there in front of,
rvIfl5Q66T061,17.49,18.02,  people if we do n't matter we ca n't,Structure
,,,  it 's okay yeah now that you start from,
,,,  this point because this is the point I,
,,,  want you to start with I want you to,
,,,  start from the point where there is no,
,,,  power point and then a you build your,
rvIfl5Q66T062,18.06,18.19,  presentation and you think about your,No
,,,  artificial leg I want you to put thing,
,,,  on your power that are relevant and,
,,,  they are needed there and that you feel,
,,,  will increase the quality and relevance,
,,,  of your presentation that 's the way you,
rvIfl5Q66T063,18.23,18.37,  think about your presentation is what is,No
,,,  there that I need to help my audience,
,,,  see it better understand it better with,
,,,  Robert better three main reason for,
,,,  using on a visual and the usuals mention,
,,,  in fact the presentation is clarity,
rvIfl5Q66T064,18.42,19.01,  retention,No
,,,  and interest,
,,,  if your idea visually doe n't serve one,
,,,  of these three purpose it 's a little if,
,,,  it doe n't help your audience understand,
,,,  thing better than could not be,
rvIfl5Q66T065,19.03,19.18,  understood and this is what Josh wa,No
,,,  talking about graph proportion percent,
,,,  flow of thing is great Aboriginal later,
,,,  great for those when you show cycle so,
,,,  when you show change or when you show,
,,,  fit any rise or follow the trend or,
rvIfl5Q66T066,19.23,19.37,  other percentage thing changing over,No
,,,  time that 's that 's great retention,
,,,  that 's what Gloria wa talking about,
,,,  structuring the presentation what help,
,,,  your audience remember the presentation,
,,,  and remember where they are in the,
rvIfl5Q66T067,19.38,19.52,  presentation that 's very important,No
,,,  that 's our attention content to finally,
,,,  interest what make this presentation,
,,,  le boring every now and then it 's good,
,,,  to use your officer willing to trigger,
,,,  your audience 's interest a in if you,
rvIfl5Q66T068,19.59,20.11,  talk about something that you think,No
,,,  might not be very fascinating or my,
,,,  sound boring if you do n't show it think,
,,,  about some use of our visually that can,
,,,  make it may be a little more dramatic,
,,,  you can even do it with a graph you,
rvIfl5Q66T069,20.13,20.36,  think about it okay I 'm telling you that,No
,,,  in 1999 800,
,,,  in the US and then in 2009 winter 10,
,,,  year later 50 million people that 's up,
,,,  and I 'm telling you that and you hearing,
,,,  what I 'm saying okay but if I do this,
rvIfl5Q66T070,20.44,20.58,  that 's very clear and that will make you,No
,,,  remember wow seriously that 's a big,
,,,  change if you make this graph go from,
,,,  this one to that point and you can do it,
,,,  in PowerPoint very light there you go,
,,,  what happened you 're gon na remember that,
rvIfl5Q66T071,21.01,21.16,  that 's going to create some interest all,No
,,,  these three were mentioned by it and,
,,,  obviously our relevant recent study,
,,,  part in other visual aid if you do n't,
,,,  need for one of these reason do n't do,
,,,  it once we decided to put it in there,
rvIfl5Q66T072,21.23,21.35,  because you feel better and you need if,No
,,,  you want your power going out there are,
,,,  a few thing that are very important,
,,,  that I almost I do n't want you to feel,
,,,  like I 'm oversimplifying it for you but,
,,,  those are very important thing make,
rvIfl5Q66T073,21.37,21.53,  sure your audio visual lake is physical,No
,,,  form if you have audio make sure not to,
,,,  hear it if you have picture or the,
,,,  video or something that you go into a,
,,,  marginally screen make sure the,
,,,  definition is high enough for u to be,
rvIfl5Q66T074,21.55,22.06,  able to see it those are stealing thing,No
,,,  but they make sense if you 're giving for,
,,,  instance a presentation at a conference,
,,,  sometimes think that thing that our,
,,,  computer screen look just fine if you,
,,,  blow them up to a size that allows,
rvIfl5Q66T075,22.08,22.19,  people to,No
,,,  yeah the resolution becomes just so,
,,,  happy that you can barely see what 's on,
,,,  the screen doe importantly to remember,
,,,  the other thing to remember if you 're,
,,,  showing something you 're in a smaller,
rvIfl5Q66T076,22.21,22.32,  room and sing and you show me the graph,No
,,,  where you show here something that you,
,,,  physically falling do n't do this a you,
,,,  can clearly see because josh inquiry,
,,,  he ca n't see anything if I do this and,
,,,  people do that sometimes they would show,
rvIfl5Q66T077,22.34,22.49,  a model for instance and they would put,No
,,,  this model over here a you can clearly,
,,,  see in my model and then you can but you,
,,,  can you ca n't even see my autumn those,
,,,  are important think about those those,
,,,  reason are wide sometimes mention if,
rvIfl5Q66T078,22.51,23.03,  you have the opportunity check the room,No
,,,  out first because when since if you and,
,,,  in some science mod are really,
,,,  important you show home you use them,
,,,  make sure you can display them to make,
,,,  sure people can see that make sure you,
rvIfl5Q66T079,23.06,23.23,  know how to place yourself in roughton,No
,,,  to do n't get it away or anything like,
,,,  that if you 're using something that is,
,,,  very dynamic or very colorful make sure,
,,,  that it is understandable sometimes,
,,,  people do overload oh I 'm going to do,
rvIfl5Q66T080,23.25,23.39,  bright green with orange you 're bad at,No
,,,  the end of it you 're just end of the,
,,,  screen filled with color but you still,
,,,  understand what 's going on those are,
,,,  really important those are important to,
,,,  remember those are n't important to keep,
rvIfl5Q66T081,23.41,24.01,  in mind a you 're preparing for your,No
,,,  presentation finally which I mentioned,
,,,  at the very beginning but I again,
,,,  you 're all usually is n't for you it 's,
,,,  not for you do n't make your PowerPoint,
,,,  your outline I strongly encourage you to,
rvIfl5Q66T082,24.07,24.23,  either have your note on the side of,No
,,,  your slideshow which is possible or have,
,,,  your note underneath your slide but,
,,,  they do n't show on the screen or have,
,,,  enough time in hand because you 're,
,,,  what 's showing here is not for you,
rvIfl5Q66T083,24.28,24.45,  people who listen to you do n't care how,No
,,,  you got there they are interested in why,
,,,  they are seeing it if it 's only for you,
,,,  put it only hotline put it next to it,
,,,  do n't you see what I 'm saying this is,
,,,  very important and this is why people,
rvIfl5Q66T084,24.46,25.02,  read their hard work because they,No
,,,  prepare your powerpoints for themselves,
,,,  so then they need them to figure out,
,,,  where they are thence know how it work,
,,,  this is for you not for me if I need to,
,,,  remember that this is very keen,
rvIfl5Q66T085,25.03,25.16,  attention and interest I 'm going to,No
,,,  write it over here otherwise they all,
,,,  good okay so plan why is it important oh,
,,,  ok finally besides looking order not,
,,,  noticing that the root on fire it did,
,,,  to reduce it in a way because if you,
rvIfl5Q66T086,25.19,25.3,  have to be drawn PowerPoint,No
,,,  subconsciously what people are thinking,
,,,  is I 'm okay why do you not know what you,
,,,  do n't know because if you need to read,
,,,  it then why do you need me try to the,
,,,  one rocket you know what 's that ready ah,
rvIfl5Q66T087,25.35,25.48,  the other reason why not to write,No
,,,  everything on your PowerPoint is why do,
,,,  you keep,
,,,  if they can meet ago make yourself,
,,,  relevant make your audience pay,
,,,  attention to you because if you provide,
rvIfl5Q66T088,25.51,26.06,  everything for them that white then just,Structure
,,,  go on just put your heart where you go,
,,,  cause if we do n't need it you then what,
,,,  what 's the point of the whole thing you,
,,,  have to have certain information that,
,,,  come from you and only from you because,
rvIfl5Q66T089,26.09,26.34,  that 's why you 're there that 's why we 're,No
,,,  interested in you not your power,
,,,  two more thing I want to mention first,
,,,  if you have slide and you have outlined,
,,,  separately include change of slide in,
,,,  your outline that 's an important thing,
rvIfl5Q66T090,26.38,26.54,  to remember to include your APA year of,No
,,,  your visual aid whatever it is in your,
,,,  outline for yourself so you know when,
,,,  you need to change the slide so you know,
,,,  when you 're going to move from here to,
,,,  here and for instance work with a model,
rvIfl5Q66T091,26.56,27.1,  sometimes what we get very stressed out,No
,,,  we forget what is supposed to be,
,,,  accompanying what we 're talking what I,
,,,  it happened to be at least several time,
,,,  when in my public speaking class when I,
,,,  tell student to very help your body,
rvIfl5Q66T092,27.11,27.29,  mutilated practice with it what people,No
,,,  do is they will give my lecture about we,
,,,  do n't have to have found some rest able,
,,,  to talk to constrain echo enhance it,
,,,  for the whole street this one 's life and,
,,,  then they deliver their my foot and they,
rvIfl5Q66T093,27.3,27.43,  deliver delivered delivered and then,No
,,,  they 'd rather like oh and i teach not,
,,,  enough it 's at least two time every,
,,,  corner because if you do n't practice,
,,,  with your or if you like you do n't,
,,,  remember your hanna beth and people were,
rvIfl5Q66T094,27.45,28.02,  getting by on serving so included in,Structure
,,,  your outline if you have something that,
,,,  you need to do change which included in,
,,,  your plan and finally you know how when,
,,,  you 're drifting in,
,,,  kind of sitting in presentation anything,
rvIfl5Q66T095,28.04,28.21,  bother good boy it 's not what do you,No
,,,  read this part of the person that 's,
,,,  behind them or they talk about this,
,,,  fireman side and we talked over my way,
,,,  of what were you through this one and,
,,,  this one is a riddle these little note,
rvIfl5Q66T096,28.22,28.34,  that they have here a little note thank,No
,,,  you that 's kind of the cool little,
,,,  corner here I wa n't on the ornament I,
,,,  like that I wonder if I could do that,
,,,  for my ta class and then that purple,
,,,  that look really weird indeed they,
rvIfl5Q66T097,28.36,28.5,  would n't go with me and you got all that,No
,,,  already well if you want your audience,
,,,  not to do better show the thing that,
,,,  you talk about only when you talk about,
,,,  them do n't show thing you do n't talk,
,,,  about and do n't talk about thing you 're,
rvIfl5Q66T098,28.51,29.1,  not showing so for instance I absolutely,No
,,,  for instance if you talk about an,
,,,  elephant zebra in a squirrel when you,
,,,  talk about an elephant a picture of an,
,,,  elephant and do n't say in a minute okay,
,,,  we 're going to come from 0 so 0 know why,
rvIfl5Q66T099,29.13,29.26,  I 'm sure we go or mono I 'm talking about,No
,,,  it look we 're switching to a zebra and,
,,,  here the 0 NE picture 10 the picture,
,,,  do n't say holy way about elephant so,
,,,  the other thing no no no no we 're done,
,,,  we 're on sequence right now what happens,
rvIfl5Q66T0100,29.29,29.43,  if you want to say something between a,No
,,,  zebra a squirrel do you leave a zebra or,
,,,  you go her squirrel you have a blank,
,,,  slide I 'm just right in between u in,
,,,  grant world if you need one because,
,,,  you 're talking about something that 's,
rvIfl5Q66T0101,29.45,29.57,  not zebra related not yet squirrel,No
,,,  related but important to put in the,
,,,  middle then Clint is life so you have,
,,,  your zebra you have a visual break for,
,,,  this one there,
,,,  Jersey rather than already horse world,
rvIfl5Q66T0102,29.59,30.15,  yet no it 's not silly man I 'm sorry is,No
,,,  that confusing very often because people,
,,,  there for people do your audience would,
,,,  go ahead if you show them the side,
,,,  they 're gon na read it if you show them,
,,,  something that you 're not talking about,
rvIfl5Q66T0103,30.16,30.28,  yet of course they 're going to be,No
,,,  reading it not they 're good listening to,
,,,  you why ooh there 's something you think,
,,,  about do n't be afraid to turn your,
,,,  PowerPoint off for a second if you 're,
,,,  done with this section before you move,
rvIfl5Q66T0104,30.3,30.45,  on to this section put an ice cream it 's,No
,,,  perfectly acceptable on asking about the,
,,,  blank screen and also a good had they,
,,,  kind of get people out of this car may,
,,,  notice were there,
,,,  and you can put a blank screen that,
rvIfl5Q66T0105,30.48,31.01,  they 're like oh I forgot this person is,No
,,,  talking so if that 's a great point,
,,,  absolutely yeah and that 's that 's a,
,,,  great point wa my major symptom you 're,
,,,  there and they forget her there if you,
,,,  are completely and utterly year they,
rvIfl5Q66T0106,31.05,31.3,  really forget that they 're listening to,No
,,,  you they 're listening to your power,
,,,  that 's that only attended point of,
,,,  personal again where they do n't make it,
,,,  better myself and this line there you go,
,,,  now this to be but no it 's a very valid,
rvIfl5Q66T0107,31.33,31.53,  point it get people kind of like you,No
,,,  know and it 's helpful like 20 minute,
,,,  reservation good to give you 100 okay,
,,,  let 's go hooray it 's a good wake up ok,
,,,  so to conclude make sure you do n't talk,
,,,  about thing for not showing talk about,
rvIfl5Q66T0108,31.56,32.1,  thing up in yourself and do n't show,Structure
,,,  them money not our problem um start from,
,,,  the point where there is no PowerPoint,
,,,  start from a point where this is what I,
,,,  have to say what in it could it be,
,,,  better illustrated with some bobby pin,
rvIfl5Q66T0109,32.12,32.34,  will help do n't talk to it,No
,,,  um and trick with all these at once and,
,,,  all sometimes we think thing work but,
,,,  we all need to look at all of it going,
,,,  we will know that it doe n't do the,
,,,  question about relevance cavity,
rvIfl5Q66T0110,32.38,32.58,  interest the blank slide thing is really,No
,,,  using me because i feel like if i were,
,,,  to show that at a conference or in class,
,,,  everyone what is anybody in the state so,
,,,  that you i have to say that oh this link,
,,,  slide is to get you to focus on me now,
rvIfl5Q66T0111,33.01,33.13,  do i explain that or joy discipline it,No
,,,  but yeah if you cure several that 's,
,,,  about a point all of a sudden had a,
,,,  black screen people might think Oh what,
,,,  happened there are several way to go,
,,,  about it one way if you meet this,
rvIfl5Q66T0112,33.16,33.27,  breakage if you talk about one thing and,No
,,,  then you 're mean no you do n't need any,
,,,  audio visual leg and then you need it,
,,,  again what you can do is you can put,
,,,  something on the slide that let them,
,,,  know it 's still in the code of your,
rvIfl5Q66T0113,33.3,33.4,  powerpoint it 's in the same theme sure,No
,,,  but there 's nothing on it so basically,
,,,  like if you 're powerful point in,
,,,  schuyler green just that 's one way to go,
,,,  on it and the same way to go about it,
,,,  and I 'm glad you mentioned it because it,
rvIfl5Q66T0114,33.43,33.56,  make it more conversational for,No
,,,  naturalism you can totally tell let me,
,,,  now address something else or let me,
,,,  just talk about egg you just put it up,
,,,  there and you address it in a way that,
,,,  let them know we do n't need it right,
rvIfl5Q66T0115,33.59,34.11,  now you can even say okay let 's forget,No
,,,  how partnership continued and then you,
,,,  can go back to your site so there are,
,,,  several thing to do what you can and I,
,,,  do n't see why not absolutely you look,
,,,  joke about it you know or or comment on,
rvIfl5Q66T0116,34.14,34.26,  some,No
,,,  let them know I do what I 'm doing about,
,,,  or which is very important people tend,
,,,  to assume that I hope no hole did,
,,,  something happen or have it like in the,
,,,  theme of your PowerPoint but just with,
rvIfl5Q66T0117,34.29,34.52,  no content another good way to do that,No
,,,  is to change where you are so allows my,
,,,  favorite enjoy and then you have blank,
,,,  screen do hanson and a walk friend,
,,,  green again you 're still presenting and,
,,,  you know what you 're doing it yeah so,
rvIfl5Q66T0118,34.56,35.14,  100 that if you if you have a template,Structure
,,,  very slight or very few just wait if you,
,,,  blink into black would be something they,
,,,  would n't boot give me pleasure that 's,
,,,  intentional change and I like,
,,,  you can press the point that 's great but,
rvIfl5Q66T0119,35.17,35.33,  we need black so then you can approach,No
,,,  to your computer point and say well,
,,,  let 's talk about this yeah you can kind,
,,,  of make it visible that you 're turning,
,,,  it off that 's another yet and you,
,,,  switching that 's another way to approach,
rvIfl5Q66T0120,35.34,35.47,  it absolutely sometimes you can discus,Structure
,,,  on the machine to help these kid where,
,,,  you can switch the what is this,
,,,  hopefully I can see if you make you want,
,,,  Oakland come on always find effective,
,,,  people at the beginning in heaven,
rvIfl5Q66T0121,35.49,36.06,  outline maybe three point and talk,Structure
,,,  about the finished one point let u show,
,,,  that next point on this nice to know now,
,,,  that 's i can say talk about three thing,
,,,  first talk number one and voice which to,
,,,  number two let 's put up the title of two,
rvIfl5Q66T0122,36.1,36.24,  oh and that 'll give you an opportunity,Structure
,,,  like top three and freedom a while,
,,,  before you go into yeah that 's a good,
,,,  thing too if you have like label kind,
,,,  of like if you have on the main point,
,,,  and it ha some point you can just put,
rvIfl5Q66T0123,36.27,36.47,  your main point on the screen and just,No
,,,  talk about yourself once yeah that might,
,,,  be good idea to you sir that power point,
,,,  is n't always necessary but i 'm wondering,
,,,  if you do n't recover quite you see maybe,
,,,  wa n't professional or le prepared so,
rvIfl5Q66T0124,36.49,37.03,  to kind of bridge that gap what other,No
,,,  kind of visual aid which bring in the,
,,,  power point because whenever i need of,
,,,  doing like a poster instead I guess,
,,,  HYFR great for losing every foot thing,
,,,  for it and i boosted and I feel like,
rvIfl5Q66T0125,37.06,37.18,  that 's not professional eater well think,Structure
,,,  about our first guest lecture she did n't,
,,,  have a house point she had hanged up for,
,,,  u with the structure for presentation,
,,,  if you have small enough audience that,
,,,  might be a way to go ah what else always,
rvIfl5Q66T0126,37.24,37.37,  few free to use aboard a you like that,Structure
,,,  give structure to and that 's really good,
,,,  if you create thing a you go if you,
,,,  want to show a certain progression or if,
,,,  you want to end up with a structure like,
,,,  what we did last time with the structure,
rvIfl5Q66T0127,37.4,37.52,  the board I felt wa a good use of audio,No
,,,  visual aid this last time because I wa,
,,,  kind of talking about the zebra and I,
,,,  went and then we ended up with the,
,,,  structure of the horn so if you have the,
,,,  opportunity to use the board that might,
rvIfl5Q66T0128,37.53,38.05,  be a good idea sometimes then you do n't,No
,,,  need an actual PowerPoint presentation,
,,,  even though you can use your computer,
,,,  for instance if you do n't know your,
,,,  research and you need a table because,
,,,  you present result you do n't have to,
rvIfl5Q66T0129,38.09,38.25,  have five slide you can have a slide,No
,,,  with your result and that 's it it still,
,,,  show people you have the result you,
,,,  have all your peep and whatever you,
,,,  the and they still see that you know,
,,,  what you 're talking about but you do n't,
rvIfl5Q66T0130,38.27,38.44,  physically need to kind of like build up,No
,,,  on it then get so many people do too and,
,,,  I think you do need you know but um,
,,,  absolutely feel free to use your,
,,,  computer joke and even have a picture or,
,,,  your result or table what everything,
rvIfl5Q66T0131,38.46,39.17,  but the board sometimes like our first,No
,,,  is a traditional and up for u I use the,
,,,  ball constantly out my appointment time,
,,,  I do n't absolutely necessarily have to,
,,,  know it is a good way to use the laser,
,,,  it depends would I would hesitate to,
rvIfl5Q66T0132,39.22,39.35,  answer them brush this question in a,No
,,,  very yes or no fashion because it 's so,
,,,  much depends on the content like I can,
,,,  imagine some scientific presentation,
,,,  where they 're showing thing on the,
,,,  model or in space where it really,
rvIfl5Q66T0133,39.38,39.51,  matter where we look at and it 's very,No
,,,  important for u to to be looking at,
,,,  exactly what the speaker showing u and,
,,,  obviously like your pointer that case is,
,,,  better than TV so here oh my sliding,
,,,  lose them absolutely um at the same time,
rvIfl5Q66T0134,39.55,40.07,  I agree with you sometimes it 's an,No
,,,  overload sometimes people would use a,
,,,  laser pointer to point to their power,
,,,  and everything okay I can see about you,
,,,  know it 's on the hall there and I can,
,,,  even figure out which paragraph you 're,
rvIfl5Q66T0135,40.08,40.23,  reading whoo so yeah sometimes it 's kind,Structure
,,,  of animal so I would say just go a you,
,,,  like kind of go back to this is it 's,
,,,  going hope them if it 's something that,
,,,  will really help your audience know,
,,,  exactly what you want if it 's a,
rvIfl5Q66T0136,40.25,40.44,  necessary one one for the next,No
,,,  in my hand,
,,,  is it you know you 're going to talk,
,,,  about it next you can duplicate that,
,,,  slide and then you just have my circle,
,,,  of it so that 's that 's always a good one,
rvIfl5Q66T0137,40.48,41.01,  that is true you can just point to it or,No
,,,  you can cut a circle or you pick up,
,,,  that 's sometimes what people do is they,
,,,  take a part they have a slide to the,
,,,  general picture or not or something and,
,,,  then they just take apart and larger,
rvIfl5Q66T0138,41.02,41.17,  than that 's the next slide then,No
,,,  sometimes a good way to and I I figured,
,,,  that out when I practicing am i pointing,
,,,  at my screen and one way that I do it I,
,,,  do it over the phone with my mom for we,
,,,  both have the power cord the division,
rvIfl5Q66T0139,41.18,41.33,  and then I give my presentation to her,No
,,,  over the phone and I come up with am I,
,,,  having to stop and be like oh are you,
,,,  being at this part of the slide and,
,,,  that 's right figure out they call me too,
,,,  practicing and figuring out what device,
rvIfl5Q66T0140,41.43,42.18,  where I 'm supposed to be showing like,Structure
,,,  that wa n't necessarily following,
,,,  i made a new piece of like,
,,,  this is a very good question where to,
,,,  include your end up with unique because,
,,,  the problem is if you give them the,
rvIfl5Q66T0141,42.2,42.34,  handout for the presentation they 're,No
,,,  going to read it if you give the,
,,,  handout in the middle of presentation,
,,,  that is going to be this overhead and,
,,,  then you lose the attention again if,
,,,  there is a way for you to do it,
rvIfl5Q66T0142,42.37,42.51,  sometimes it 's best to not give a,Structure
,,,  handout present what you 're talking,
,,,  about and say I 'm going to give you this,
,,,  hand up at the end of the presentation,
,,,  so do n't worry you do n't have to write,
,,,  everything down you go through the,
rvIfl5Q66T0143,42.54,43.08,  process and then you give them the,Structure
,,,  actual ground poor or tape or something,
,,,  that help them do it when they need to,
,,,  identify or go through the processor or,
,,,  classify or whatever you are talking,
,,,  about sometimes this work then you can,
rvIfl5Q66T0144,43.1,43.23,  just be like i 'm going to give you this,Structure
,,,  at the end of the presentation so let 's,
,,,  just take a look at this in their opener,
,,,  sometimes what work is if you have,
,,,  enough time to give the end up like five,
,,,  minute before the presentation you can,
rvIfl5Q66T0145,43.27,43.38,  do it and then from the beginning say,Structure
,,,  the handout i gave you will not be,
,,,  relevant until the second part of my,
,,,  presentation or until i get there,
,,,  they 're trying to get you people to let,
,,,  go and need it right now so if you can,
rvIfl5Q66T0146,43.41,43.54,  dead sometimes a good idea if you have a,Structure
,,,  small audience you can risk passing the,
,,,  hand up in your presentation because,
,,,  it 's all gon na take,
,,,  we have 58 people it 's another thing on,
,,,  deposit even while you 're talking when,
rvIfl5Q66T0147,43.57,44.12,  you 're ready for it then sit tough one,No
,,,  though it 's it 's a good question because,
,,,  the way I 'll answer it is think about,
,,,  the way to do it that would get away,
,,,  with presentation at least they get,
,,,  communicative orientation what will,
rvIfl5Q66T0148,44.15,44.28,  facilitate my message the best do I want,No
,,,  them to look at it because this is,
,,,  crucial do I want that the focus this,
,,,  because this is crucial or is it really,
,,,  really important and necessary that they,
,,,  have a piece of paper in front of them,
rvIfl5Q66T0149,44.29,44.43,  when I talk about it because if so then,Structure
,,,  maybe I sacrifice 45 second of their,
,,,  attention but to make sure that everyone,
,,,  ha a paper that 's kind of kind of,
,,,  approaching think about your message and,
,,,  what 's the most important thing in it,
rvIfl5Q66T0150,44.45,44.58,  the picture that they can follow and,Structure
,,,  then relate or the paper and run out,
,,,  there before the can they wait till the,
,,,  end or is it very important they start,
,,,  with it sometimes if you want to be,
,,,  concerned if it enough if you can that 's,
rvIfl5Q66T0151,45.01,45.23,  a good thing to do too if you really,Structure
,,,  need to hand out start with it they 're,
,,,  looking at it anyway so if you can,
,,,  any other question,
,,,  if you like a little more ready to,
,,,  consult certain issue or address some,
rvIfl5Q66T0152,45.27,45.43,  thing that might be helpful in the,No
,,,  future structure wise or PowerPoint,
,,,  right so I always wonder too much,
,,,  information in California not enough,
,,,  information sometimes people need their,
,,,  PowerPoint sometimes we do n't really,
rvIfl5Q66T0153,45.45,45.57,  that they put a bunch of stuff up so I,No
,,,  ca n't concentrate a live in PowerPoint,
,,,  at the same time it 's inclusive but i,
,,,  think if i look at what you 've told u,
,,,  to any that if these people with thing,
,,,  all this wishy washy snuggle I know what,
rvIfl5Q66T0154,46,46.1,  to do this should make it clear ca n't,No
,,,  lie down if the audience doe n't because,
,,,  if that 's what happens when you talk,
,,,  about the situation when people put pop,
,,,  up hard when they talk about something,
,,,  else that 's not following the talking,
rvIfl5Q66T0155,46.13,46.24,  about thing you 're showing do n't talk,No
,,,  about thing you love showing and no,
,,,  joke thing that you 're not talking,
,,,  about because that of course people are,
,,,  not going to be that 's irrelevant I,
,,,  do n't even know why people do it and,
rvIfl5Q66T0156,46.26,46.39,  shoot me will do it sometimes why do you,No
,,,  seriously expect u to be able to read,
,,,  and listen to pay attention to both do,
,,,  you have an extra head for u to them,
,,,  tonight and a lot of it wa absolutely,
,,,  yeah it sequel,
rvIfl5Q66T0157,46.46,47.02,  the sometime when you is a one slide,No
,,,  with only work level,
,,,  time,
,,,  you know what this is called wan na,
,,,  address that this actually talk about,
,,,  it in detail and I feel like they 're,
rvIfl5Q66T0158,47.05,47.16,  doing good job because they talk about,No
,,,  stuff like pastel color are better for,
,,,  background sharper color are better,
,,,  for that and they address a lot of,
,,,  technical stuff like that that I kind of,
,,,  did n't want to go into because I knew,
rvIfl5Q66T0159,47.17,47.3,  that this is what they 're covering in,No
,,,  part but the general rule is the pastel,
,,,  color work better for background and,
,,,  make an impression like you put some,
,,,  work in bedding ferda are thursday,
,,,  gon na cover that a well he 's going to,
rvIfl5Q66T0160,47.32,47.48,  talk about you know what font are very,No
,,,  to use what color are that were n't good,
,,,  and also gon na be Kiki ha in computer,
,,,  lab you are going and we have a lot more,
,,,  and I feel like I did n't really want to,
,,,  get into that 's why i wa n't really,
rvIfl5Q66T0161,47.49,48.02,  technical with you guy we 're gon na have,No
,,,  a person who 's i 'm looking forward to,
,,,  learning from i 'm just so excited it 's,
,,,  like hard work um so much better and,
,,,  good and I did n't want to Miami 's,
,,,  overstepping and I do that from me is,
