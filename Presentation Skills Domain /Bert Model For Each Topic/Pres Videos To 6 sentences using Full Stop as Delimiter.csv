MnIPpUiTcRc1,0.01,0.14,"Pay practitioner today, I'm going to be"
,,,"teaching you with the help of my friend,"
,,,"Dana Blouin, the top seven tip for a"
,,,"great presentation,"
,,,Dana blue and a an entrepreneur
,,,"currently living in Bangkok, Thailand,"
,,,where he is a co and CEO of a
,,,company called mango lab. Anyways here's
MnIPpUiTcRc2,0.14,0.17,some of his tip. We all have to give
MnIPpUiTcRc3,0.17,0.34,presentation at different point in our
,,,life that might be for school or work or
,,,an organization that you weren't
,,,involved with no matter where We give
,,,"the presentation, or to who we want to"
,,,make sure that it ha the impact on the
,,,"Audience and that it memorable, these"
,,,are seven tip that are going to ensure
,,,"that you nail the presentation, and leave"
,,,a lasting impression on your audience.
MnIPpUiTcRc4,0.35,0.35,Number one know your audience. The first
MnIPpUiTcRc5,0.35,0.41,step in preparing for any presentation
,,,should be to get a better idea of who
,,,your audience. is. Knowing your audience.
MnIPpUiTcRc6,0.41,0.41,
MnIPpUiTcRc7,0.43,1.01,will allow you to understand the type of
,,,content they are going to be expecting
,,,with regard to depth and technical
,,,"detail, you want to give the"
,,,same presentation to a group of high
,,,school student who are interested in
,,,"entrepreneurship, that you went to a"
,,,"roomful of startup, founder and CEOs,"
,,,because their expectation and level of
,,,understanding will be on completely
,,,different level dig up a much a you
,,,can about who your audience. is. what
MnIPpUiTcRc8,1.01,1.05,industry they work in and what
,,,position they generally hold. This
MnIPpUiTcRc9,1.05,1.11,allows you to really tailor the content
,,,"and delivery of the presentation, in a"
,,,way that will really make it stand out
,,,and be too many time.
MnIPpUiTcRc10,1.13,1.23,People give killer presentation at one
,,,venue to a group made up of their core
,,,audience and then bomb on the same
,,,presentation to a different group
,,,because they make the change
,,,they needed to better address the new
,,,audience just because you kill it in one
,,,audience. mean the same exact
MnIPpUiTcRc11,1.25,1.48,content will replicate the reaction with
,,,all Audience Number two use structure
,,,to build on idea If you stand up and
,,,"give a presentation, and all the point"
,,,you want to make are just tossed around
,,,"randomly and they make any sense,"
,,,not too many People are going to enjoy
,,,your presentation and If they remember
,,,"it, it, likely that it not For the"
,,,"reason that you want them to, however, if"
,,,you structure your presentation in a way
,,,that each idea each section build on
,,,"the one before it, you help your audience."
MnIPpUiTcRc12,1.49,1.51,connect with the content and create
,,,logical link between the concept. This
MnIPpUiTcRc13,1.51,2,is a great way to make more complex
,,,idea easier for the Audience to
,,,understand and remember
,,,number three use visuals another great
,,,tool to cement. Those idea in the mind
MnIPpUiTcRc14,2,2.02,of your audience. is. to use visuals like
MnIPpUiTcRc15,2.02,2.06,chart graph and infographics to
,,,illustrate and communicate a concept. a
MnIPpUiTcRc16,2.06,2.1,many a 65 percent of People are
,,,considered to be visual learner. So if
MnIPpUiTcRc17,2.1,2.27,you take this approach in your
,,,presentation you are going to ignore the
,,,vast majority of the population using an
,,,"image, regardless of If it, a picture"
,,,graph or chart can be a much more potent
,,,conveyor of information and ha a much
,,,more powerful impact on the Audience a
,,,single image can convey so much
,,,information just like the old saying
,,,that a picture worth a thousand word.
MnIPpUiTcRc18,2.29,2.35,It really is think of the impact This
,,,can have when explaining data or result
,,,"in a presentation, If you had to stand"
,,,there in front of your audience. and go
MnIPpUiTcRc19,2.35,2.43,"through every data point verbally, it can"
,,,get bad quickly and This is much more
,,,common of an occurrence than you might
,,,think But if you able to visualize
,,,that data for your audience. with a graph
MnIPpUiTcRc20,2.43,2.56,or chart you instantly make it much more
,,,"understandable and memorable, showing"
,,,someone 200 percent growth with a graph
,,,is much more exciting than explaining it
,,,"while looking at the raw data,"
,,,"for example, If I took away the screen of"
,,,"This video and all you saw wa black, it"
,,,be near a exciting number. Four
MnIPpUiTcRc21,2.56,3.21,repetition is your friend having a bit
,,,of structure in your presentation go a
,,,long way in keeping the Audience engaged
,,,because they can follow the information
,,,from step to step But even more than
,,,just structuring the flow of the
,,,"presentation, you also want to build in"
,,,repetition This encourages people to
,,,remember the key point of the
,,,"presentation, and help it stick which"
,,,again make it and you more memorable a
,,,classic way to go about repetition is
,,,something Dana learned early on when he
,,,started his public speaking career.
MnIPpUiTcRc22,3.23,3.26,Another speaker at a big regional tech
,,,event came up to him after a talk and
,,,complimented Dana on is. delivery in the
MnIPpUiTcRc23,3.26,3.36,depth of the material but asked why he
,,,use more repetition Dana wa a
,,,"bit stumped, because he never really"
,,,thought about that before the Other
,,,speaker suggested that Dana start
,,,telling the Audience what it is. he
MnIPpUiTcRc24,3.36,3.44,wanted to tell them just to give them a
,,,brief rundown of the key point after
,,,that move right into the body of the
,,,"presentation, and tell them exactly what"
,,,wa highlighted at the beginning. But
MnIPpUiTcRc25,3.44,3.53,"obviously, with more detail and extra"
,,,element that you add in to make the
,,,"presentation, stick then in the"
,,,"presentation, by telling them what you"
,,,"just told them, reminding them of the key"
,,,point and a brief summary for final
,,,repetition. Using this technique help to
MnIPpUiTcRc26,3.55,3.58,reinforce the main point of the
,,,"presentation, at least three time at the"
,,,beginning. middle and end. The key is to
MnIPpUiTcRc27,4,4,
MnIPpUiTcRc28,4,4.08,"find a way to do this, that it feel"
,,,"natural and not overly scholastic, and"
,,,that take practice which talk
,,,about later. On tip Number five have a
MnIPpUiTcRc29,4.08,4.2,story to tell
,,,the difference between an average
,,,presentation that People zone out of and
,,,"a great presentation, that keep them"
,,,engaged is how you convey the
,,,information to the Audience
,,,a great way to convey the information or
,,,key point of your presentation is. to
MnIPpUiTcRc30,4.2,4.23,use a story
,,,using a story preferably an interesting
,,,one. You get your point across and you
MnIPpUiTcRc31,4.25,4.29,"creating a moment in the presentation,"
,,,that is. memorable and easier for the
MnIPpUiTcRc32,4.29,4.31,"Audience to recall later. also,"
MnIPpUiTcRc33,4.31,4.35,hopefully going to be something that
,,,catch their attention pulling them in
,,,to what you were saying. One of the key
MnIPpUiTcRc34,4.35,4.4,"here, though, is that it ha to be a story"
,,,"you can tell with commitment, and it ha"
,,,to be true always be honest with your
,,,audience. because because If you not
MnIPpUiTcRc35,4.42,4.45,they will know and you will have lost
,,,"all credibility, tip Number six. Be"
MnIPpUiTcRc36,4.45,4.53,relatable being relatable is actually
,,,one of the most important factor of
,,,your delivery you want to be someone
,,,"that your audience. can relate to, But"
MnIPpUiTcRc37,4.53,4.55,they would feel comfortable with talking
,,,to. Even when giving a talk a an expert
MnIPpUiTcRc38,4.56,5.06,"on a topic, you want the Audience to feel"
,,,"the relation it help them mentally,"
,,,engage with your content and remember
,,,you and your talk
,,,most people do feel comfortable going
,,,up and talking to. a stern authority
MnIPpUiTcRc39,5.06,5.09,figure and no one want to listen to
,,,someone with no confidence. So there a
MnIPpUiTcRc40,5.09,5.16,"fine balance, you need a strike and"
,,,"here, how the most important thing you"
,,,can do to come across a more relatable
,,,"is to be authentic, be yourself. Another"
MnIPpUiTcRc41,5.16,5.21,great way to accomplish this is to work
,,,on coming across a relaxed which can be
,,,difficult. If you not used to
MnIPpUiTcRc42,5.23,5.33,"presenting, but This go a long way to"
,,,"helping people, see you a relatable the"
,,,final way you can be a more relatable is
,,,to be enthusiastic about your
,,,presentation your enthusiasm will
,,,transfer to your audience. and now that
MnIPpUiTcRc43,5.33,5.42,you have enthusiasm in common you will
,,,begin to see is more relatable If you
,,,get all three of these technique
,,,"mastered, you will be we'll On your way to"
,,,"making it to your audience. relate to, you"
MnIPpUiTcRc44,5.42,5.44,tip Number seven build your confidence.
MnIPpUiTcRc45,5.46,5.49,"with practice this might be the last tip,"
,,,but it is. by far the most important one
MnIPpUiTcRc46,5.49,5.51,out of these seven confidence. and what
MnIPpUiTcRc47,5.51,5.54,you do is by far the most important
,,,element of your presentation having
,,,confidence. add an authority to
MnIPpUiTcRc48,5.56,6,everything you say during your
,,,presentation But you not going to
,,,develop the confidence. you need If you
MnIPpUiTcRc49,6,6.02,do practice and practice a lot.
MnIPpUiTcRc50,6.04,6.05,Whatever Dana give a talk or
,,,presentation he practice he say for
,,,hour. They want to make sure he
MnIPpUiTcRc51,6.08,6.11,ha the timing down that he know every
,,,"slide, so he have to read off"
,,,"them. He know what the next slide is, So"
MnIPpUiTcRc52,6.13,6.18,he can smoothly transition between them
,,,So that he will sound natural and
,,,"authentic, and can explain the concept."
MnIPpUiTcRc53,6.19,6.19,and tell the story with confidence. and
MnIPpUiTcRc54,6.19,6.35,This all come with practice when you
,,,"are practicing a presentation, it not"
,,,enough to sit in front of your computer
,,,and go through it you have to practice
,,,it in front of Other people Invite some
,,,friend over and have them give some
,,,feedback on your presentation and make
,,,improvement based on their feedback No
,,,one get it right the first time. But
MnIPpUiTcRc55,6.35,6.37,practice will
,,,get you towards perfect. With these seven
MnIPpUiTcRc56,6.37,6.42,tip you should be able to put together
,,,and deliver a masterful presentation
,,,that will wow your audience. and make
MnIPpUiTcRc57,6.42,6.51,sure that they remember you and your

yoD8RMq2OkU1,0,0.07,Transcriber : eric vautier Reviewer : Helene Vernet
,,,Most people who come to speak at TED are here because they ’ ve succeeded .
yoD8RMq2OkU2,0.13,0.13,I ’ m here because I haven ’ t .
yoD8RMq2OkU3,0.17,0.23,For the last ten year
,,,I ’ ve been helping conference speaker business leader entrepreneur
,,,to prepare and deliver powerful presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU4,0.27,0.3,And in those same ten year TED ha shown
,,,that presentation can and should be both enjoyable and effective .
yoD8RMq2OkU5,0.37,0.47,But ten year on
,,,despite TED and despite my best effort at school conference and company
,,,most presentation still do this to their audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU6,0.53,0.55,So have I failed ?
,,,No ! I just have n't succeeded yet .
yoD8RMq2OkU7,0.59,1.04,And to succeed in making all presentation resonate with their audience
,,,I need your help .
yoD8RMq2OkU8,1.06,1.06,That ’ s why I ’ m here .
yoD8RMq2OkU9,1.08,1.09,So I ’ d like to share with you
,,,the three magic ingredient of powerful presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU10,1.15,1.15,OK let ’ s just pause there for a moment .
yoD8RMq2OkU11,1.18,1.18,I ’ ve told you what I ’ m going to say .
yoD8RMq2OkU12,1.21,1.31,The question you should be asking is :
,,, So what ? What ’ s in it for me ? Why should I care ? ''
,,,And that is a really important question
,,,because the first magic ingredient is in fact the audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU13,1.36,1.36,The audience is the magic ingredient in every presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU14,1.39,1.39,This is not my talk it ’ s yours .
yoD8RMq2OkU15,1.42,1.45,Every presentation should be made to measure
,,,for a specific audience in a specific context .
yoD8RMq2OkU16,1.49,1.58,So why should you care about the magic ingredient of great presentation ?
,,,Well it 's very important right ?
,,,It ’ s really important to understand that we all have to listen to presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU17,2.03,2.18,Wouldn ’ t it be great if they weren ’ t all so boring ?
,,,But we don ’ t just listen to presentation
,,,we also have to give presentations right ?
,,,How many of you ever have to give presentation ?
,,,I think if we ’ re honest we all do .
yoD8RMq2OkU18,2.21,2.32,Sooner or later at school or at work
,,,and also in interview
,,,we all have to present with or without slide
,,,and it ’ s how well we present
,,,that will make a huge difference to how well we succeed .
yoD8RMq2OkU19,2.36,2.36,That ’ s why you should care .
yoD8RMq2OkU20,2.39,2.39,So that ’ s the first magic ingredient : the audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU21,2.42,2.42,Always make it special for them .
yoD8RMq2OkU22,2.46,2.46,The second magic ingredient is the speaker .
yoD8RMq2OkU23,2.5,2.52,Now you ’ re probably looking at me and thinking :
,,,“ Well Phil not very magical . ”
yoD8RMq2OkU24,2.52,3.02,Thanks by the way !
,,,But it ’ s really important that you put something of yourself in there
,,,something only you can say .
yoD8RMq2OkU25,3.05,3.14,This doesn ’ t mean you tell them what you had for breakfast
,,,but it doe mean that if someone else
,,,could give the exact same presentation in your place
,,,then you didn ’ t put anything personal into it .
yoD8RMq2OkU26,3.16,3.2,And that matter because when you share
,,,we care .
yoD8RMq2OkU27,3.21,3.21,So show why you care why it ’ s important to you .
yoD8RMq2OkU28,3.25,3.25,Tell u example and story from your experience .
yoD8RMq2OkU29,3.29,3.29,And that will make it more personal and more memorable .
yoD8RMq2OkU30,3.33,3.36,So those are the first two magic ingredient :
,,,the audience and the speaker .
yoD8RMq2OkU31,3.38,3.41,I know it doesn ’ t sound very magical
,,,but you ’ d be amazed how many presentation have neither of them .
yoD8RMq2OkU32,3.46,3.46,So the third magic ingredient is transformation .
yoD8RMq2OkU33,3.5,3.56,Now most presentation aim only to inform their audience
,,,and it doesn ’ t work very well .
yoD8RMq2OkU34,3.58,4.05,Let me take out my magic wand because I ’ m going to do a disappearing trick
,,,because like this guy
,,,we forget most of what we hear very quickly indeed .
yoD8RMq2OkU35,4.11,4.15,But good presentation are not about information
,,,they are about transformation .
yoD8RMq2OkU36,4.17,4.22,They are about changing something in what your audience belief
,,,in what they feel in what they do .
yoD8RMq2OkU37,4.25,4.28,Imagine you are making a pitch
,,,for raising fund for a project or a start .
yoD8RMq2OkU38,4.32,4.36,After your pitch the audience know everything they need to know
,,,but they don ’ t fund you .
yoD8RMq2OkU39,4.38,4.39,Did you succeed ?
,,,No .
yoD8RMq2OkU40,4.41,4.53,Now imagine that after your pitch your audience doe give you the fund
,,,because they feel confident and trusting
,,,and they believe that your project will be successful
,,,and that it is a good investment .
yoD8RMq2OkU41,4.55,4.55,All of that is not information it ’ s transformation .
yoD8RMq2OkU42,5,5.05,So it ’ s easy for me to say “ Don ’ t inform transform ! ”
,,,but how ?
,,,Well every magician need a magic wand and here is yours .
yoD8RMq2OkU43,5.1,5.1,It ’ s called the  Audience Transformation Roadmap . ''
yoD8RMq2OkU44,5.1,5.26,This is a really simple but amazingly powerful technique
,,,to understand what your transformational objective are
,,,and then to brainstorm
,,,what you can say show and do to transform your audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU45,5.3,5.3,So here ’ s how it work .
yoD8RMq2OkU46,5.33,5.37,To understand how to take your audience on a transformational journey
,,,you first need to work out where they are starting from .
yoD8RMq2OkU47,5.4,5.57,So we ask ourselves four simple question :
,,,What doe my audience know before my presentation ?
,,,What do they know about the subject ?
,,,What do they believe ?
,,,And what do they feel ?
,,,Now the difference between the two
,,,is believing is something you think and feeling is an emotion .
yoD8RMq2OkU48,6,6.04,So for example I believe it ’ s time for dinner
,,,I feel hungry .
yoD8RMq2OkU49,6.06,6.07,See the difference ?
,,,Right .
yoD8RMq2OkU50,6.08,6.16,So what do they know believe and feel and lastly what do they do ?
,,,Now this could be nothing maybe they do nothing relevant
,,,or maybe they do something that you need to change .
yoD8RMq2OkU51,6.21,6.23,So once you ’ ve worked out where they are before
,,,you can then take them to where you want them to go afterwards .
yoD8RMq2OkU52,6.26,6.26,And we ask the same four question but in the reverse order .
yoD8RMq2OkU53,6.31,6.31,So now we know what they do before .
yoD8RMq2OkU54,6.32,6.52,What do we want them to do after the presentation ?
,,,What do they need to feel ?
,,,What should they believe differently to feel and do those thing ?
,,,And lastly what do they need to know ?
,,,And when you follow this process
,,,you realize very quickly that the real transformation
,,,are not in what they know it ’ s in what they believe and feel and do .
yoD8RMq2OkU55,6.56,6.56,That ’ s what make the difference .
yoD8RMq2OkU56,6.59,7.1,Once we ’ ve understood where they are and where we need to take them
,,,then we can fill in the Transformation Column
,,,with all of the idea on what we can say in our presentation
,,,to make those transformation in our audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU57,7.13,7.13,And that give u the content of the presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU58,7.17,7.3,Clear so far ?
,,,Maybe we should take an example so let ’ s take one !
,,,Let ’ s assume that I am going to make a presentation
,,,and I 'd like to explain the three magic ingredient of a great presentation
,,,and I ’ d like to make my audience want to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .
yoD8RMq2OkU59,7.35,7.43,So what doe my audience know before the presentation ?
,,,Well they know that most presentation aren ’ t exactly successful
,,,and they know TED is the exception that prof that rule .
yoD8RMq2OkU60,7.47,7.48,What do they believe ?
,,,Probably like most people they believe presentation are for sharing information .
yoD8RMq2OkU61,7.53,7.53,It might be wrong but that doesn ’ t stop them believing it .
yoD8RMq2OkU62,7.57,8.05,What do they feel about presentation ?
,,,Probably bored but also resigned to a really ineffective way of presenting
,,,because that ’ s just what everyone doe .
yoD8RMq2OkU63,8.08,8.15,And lastly what do they do ?
,,,Well when it ’ s their turn to present
,,,they generally will pack thing full of information
,,,and they won ’ t personalize it to their audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU64,8.18,8.27,So what do I want them to do after my presentation ?
,,,Well afterwards I ’ m going to want them
,,,to aim to transform their audience every time they present
,,,to change something in their audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU65,8.29,8.29,I ’ m going to need them to personalize their presentation every time .
yoD8RMq2OkU66,8.34,8.38,And also I ’ d like them to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap
,,,because I know it will help them to succeed .
yoD8RMq2OkU67,8.42,8.45,What do they need to feel to do those thing ?
,,,Well If they still feel bored or resigned they ’ re not going to do very much .
yoD8RMq2OkU68,8.49,8.55,So they need to feel curious about this new technique
,,,they need to feel motivated to try it
,,,and optimistic that it can work for them .
yoD8RMq2OkU69,8.58,9.03,What do they need to believe to feel those thing ?
,,,They ’ ll need to believe that the Roadmap
,,,can actually help them to succeed in their presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU70,9.06,9.1,Lastly what do they need to know to believe feel and do those thing ?
,,,Well they ’ ll need to know the three magic ingredient that ’ s pretty basic .
yoD8RMq2OkU71,9.14,9.17,They 'll need to know presentation are bad at information
,,,but great at transformation .
yoD8RMq2OkU72,9.19,9.19,And they ’ ll need to know how to use the Audience Transformation Roadmap .
yoD8RMq2OkU73,9.24,9.24,OK now we ’ ve worked out where they were and where I want to take them .
yoD8RMq2OkU74,9.29,9.29,What can I do now ? I fill in the Transformation Column .
yoD8RMq2OkU75,9.32,9.38,So what can I say or show or do to make those transformation ?
,,,Now usually I ’ m using a flip and some sticky note here .
yoD8RMq2OkU76,9.43,9.43,So I ’ m going to use virtual sticky note .
yoD8RMq2OkU77,9.45,9.45,Let ’ s start at the top .
yoD8RMq2OkU78,9.47,9.53,We need to make sure they know the three magic ingredient
,,,so I ’ m going to need to talk at some point about the audience
,,,about the speaker and the transformation .
yoD8RMq2OkU79,9.56,9.59,They need to know presentation are bad at information
,,,so maybe I should tell them that we forget most of what we hear very quickly .
yoD8RMq2OkU80,10.03,10.03,And perhaps I can find a visual way to show that a well .
yoD8RMq2OkU81,10.08,10.12,What next ? They need to know how to use the Roadmap so I ’ d better show it to them
,,,and I guess I could make it even clearer by going through an example .
yoD8RMq2OkU82,10.16,10.17,They need to believe
,,,that the Roadmap can help them to succeed in their presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU83,10.21,10.3,So I ’ ll need to show how easy it is
,,,to take all of these sticky note off of the Transformation Column
,,,and arrange them in a suitable order
,,,to create the storyline for their presentation .
yoD8RMq2OkU84,10.32,10.32,It really is a short .
yoD8RMq2OkU85,10.34,10.34,OK now I need to make them curious .
yoD8RMq2OkU86,10.36,10.4,Now to make them curious I ’ m going to need to make them care
,,,and to make them care I need to show that I care .
yoD8RMq2OkU87,10.43,10.48,So I probably need to explain that most presentation really don ’ t succeed
,,,and that I care about fixing that .
yoD8RMq2OkU88,10.51,10.53,And then to make them care
,,,I ’ m going to need to find out how relevant it is to them .
yoD8RMq2OkU89,10.57,11.01,Perhaps I could ask them how many of them actually need to present
,,,and of course I know the answer is pretty much everybody .
yoD8RMq2OkU90,11.04,11.04,I need to make them motivated and optimistic .
yoD8RMq2OkU91,11.06,11.1,Well I can make them optimistic by explaining how easy this is to use
,,,but also how powerful it is .
yoD8RMq2OkU92,11.12,11.18,And to motivate them to try it
,,,I ’ m going to need to explain that successful presentation
,,,can really make a difference to how well they succeed in life .
yoD8RMq2OkU93,11.24,11.27,Lastly to make them do these thing I ’ ll need a call to action
,,,which focus on what I want them to do afterwards .
yoD8RMq2OkU94,11.31,11.36,So there we have it !
,,,That ’ s a very accelerated version of the brainstorming
,,,but it doesn ’ t need to take long .
yoD8RMq2OkU95,11.38,11.42,What we have now is just enough relevant idea
,,,on how we can transform our audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU96,11.45,11.5,So what happens next ?
,,,Well this is where I ’ m going to take my magic wand out again
,,,because this is where the presentation magic happens .
yoD8RMq2OkU97,11.52,12.09,This is where you can take all the sticky note off of the Transformation Column
,,,prepare a suitably magical story line
,,,and then arrange all of these idea back into that story line
,,,and hey presto there is my presentation !
,,,Now you might recognize this one because ...
yoD8RMq2OkU98,12.12,12.12,this is the presentation you have been watching for the last ten minute .
yoD8RMq2OkU99,12.17,12.17,And this is where we are now .
yoD8RMq2OkU100,12.2,12.25,Isn ’ t that magic ?
,,,So now you know what happens next !
,,,Next I need to explain how simple this can be and how powerful .
yoD8RMq2OkU101,12.29,12.29,And it ’ s so simple that it doesn ’ t take an expert .
yoD8RMq2OkU102,12.32,12.39,Thousands of people have already used this technique
,,,to prepare and deliver fantastic presentation of all kind
,,,from TED talk to the boardroom .
yoD8RMq2OkU103,12.42,12.55,But more than presentation they ’ ve used it also for email
,,,for proposal for preparing interview for preparing conference …
,,,Basically it work in any situation
,,,where you need to change what people believe feel and do .
yoD8RMq2OkU104,12.59,12.59,You really don ’ t need a magic wand .
yoD8RMq2OkU105,13.02,13.02,This is all the magic you need .
yoD8RMq2OkU106,13.1,13.1,Thank you .
yoD8RMq2OkU107,13.14,13.14,Thank you . So now I need to give you a call to action and here it is .
yoD8RMq2OkU108,13.14,13.14,
yoD8RMq2OkU109,13.2,13.26,Remember those three magic ingredient of every great presentation :
,,,the audience the speaker
,,,and the transformation you want to create in your audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU110,13.3,13.34,Try using the Audience Transformation Roadmap for your next presentation
,,,and you ’ ll be amazed at how well your idea resonate with your audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU111,13.4,13.4,And lastly please remember I need your help .
yoD8RMq2OkU112,13.44,13.44,I ca n't cure the world of bad presentation on my own .
yoD8RMq2OkU113,13.51,13.57,But together we really can make a difference !
,,,So by all mean share this with anyone you know
,,,who need a dose of presentation magic .
yoD8RMq2OkU114,14,14.02,It could be your colleague your teacher your bos
,,,but you all know someone .
yoD8RMq2OkU115,14.04,14.08,And most of all every time you get to present
,,,focus not on informing but on transforming your audience .
yoD8RMq2OkU116,14.12,14.21,That ’ s where the magic happens
,,,and if you can succeed in changing
,,,what your audience belief feel and doe
,,,there truly is no limit to what you can achieve .
yoD8RMq2OkU117,14.26,14.26,Thank you .

,,,and today I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of
,,,your presentation .

dEDcc0aCjaA4,0.13,0.14,I 'm going to show you 5 step to deliver a killer opener . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA5,0.14,0.38,If you 're watching this you probably already know that delivering great presentation is
,,,critical to advance your career but did you know that research say that most adult will
,,,stop listening to your presentation within the first 10 minute if they are n't convinced
,,,there 's something in it for them ?
,,,The problem is that most people do n't know about the skill they need to hook their audience
,,,give a great presentation and overcome their fear of doing it .
dEDcc0aCjaA6,0.43,0.44,What am I going to do ?
,,,Hi Jim .
dEDcc0aCjaA7,0.45,0.46,How 's it going ?
,,,I 'm freaking out about this big presentation I have to give tomorrow .
dEDcc0aCjaA8,0.5,0.53,Well did you write out your opener and practice it three time ?
,,,No .
dEDcc0aCjaA9,0.54,0.56,No ?
,,,Why not ?
,,,I 'm terrified and I do n't even know where to start .
dEDcc0aCjaA10,1,1,Trust me I 've been in that situation before and it 's not fun .
dEDcc0aCjaA11,1.03,1.09,So to help you out I 'm going to show you my 5 step formula to deliver a killer presentation
,,,opener every time .
dEDcc0aCjaA12,1.1,1.1,Let 's start off with step number one which is Give a Confident Introduction . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA13,1.1,1.15,One of the biggest mistake people make when they start their presentation is showing nervousness .
dEDcc0aCjaA14,1.21,1.21,Here 's the key : It 's not whether you 're nervous it 's whether you show it .
dEDcc0aCjaA15,1.25,1.25,The first thing you need to do is stand STILL .
dEDcc0aCjaA16,1.28,1.28,Do n't move .
dEDcc0aCjaA17,1.29,1.29,Do n't pace and keep your hand at your side .
dEDcc0aCjaA18,1.33,1.38,This is the most calm and confident stance on the planet and it handle the number 1
,,,need of your audience which is to feel safe .
dEDcc0aCjaA19,1.41,1.41,Now you can introduce yourself and say Hi my name is Jason Teteak . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA20,1.41,1.46,When you do this bring your inflection down at the end to show confidence .
dEDcc0aCjaA21,1.51,1.53,Instead of : Hi my name is Jason Teteak ? ''
,,,Say : Hi my name is Jason Teteak . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA22,1.53,1.58,See the difference ?
,,,Now we move on to step 2 which is Give Your Credentials .
dEDcc0aCjaA23,2.03,2.08,This is where many presenter make the mistake of simply giving their title and year of
,,,experience .
dEDcc0aCjaA24,2.09,2.13,They say something like I 'm a presentation skill coach and I 've been doing it for 20
,,,year . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA25,2.13,2.22,Yet your audience want to know : What can you do for me ? ''
,,,They need to know who you are why you 're the best person to deliver this presentation
,,,and what you have to offer them .
dEDcc0aCjaA26,2.24,2.3,For example I might say I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver
,,,amazing presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA27,2.3,2.35,What would that look like for you ?
,,,To figure this out you need a short elevator speech .
dEDcc0aCjaA28,2.38,2.42,It look like this : You know how some people have this problem ?
,,,Well I offer this solution . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA29,2.42,2.45,The solution you offer is how you help people .
dEDcc0aCjaA30,2.48,2.55,For me it wa : You know how some people have a fear of public speaking and a have
,,,hard time getting their message across in a presentation ?
,,,Well I help them overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA31,2.55,3.05,What 's your credential statement ?
,,,You 'll be amazed at the effect this ha on your audience .
dEDcc0aCjaA32,3.07,3.07,Step 3 is to Deliver Your Hook . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA33,3.07,3.16,My hook for this video presentation might look something like this I 'm going to show
,,,you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of your presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA34,3.16,3.21,When you do this you have to get your audience to feel '' something .
dEDcc0aCjaA35,3.25,3.27,How do you get them to feel ?
,,,You have 3 choice .
dEDcc0aCjaA36,3.28,3.28,You can get them to feel more happy more successful or more free .
dEDcc0aCjaA37,3.33,3.33,Look at my hook .
dEDcc0aCjaA38,3.35,3.4,I said I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of
,,,your presentation . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA39,3.4,3.54,When you captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of your presentation you 'll
,,,feel happier because they are listening to you you 'll feel more successful because you
,,,look like an expert and you 'll feel more freedom when you spend le time worrying
,,,about your presentation the night before .
dEDcc0aCjaA40,3.57,3.57,Here 's the practical for you .
dEDcc0aCjaA41,3.58,3.58,For your presentation write down the word I 'm going to show you. '' then fill in the
dEDcc0aCjaA42,3.58,4.08,rest with something that 's going to create more happiness success or freedom for your
,,,audience .
dEDcc0aCjaA43,4.09,4.09,Here 's the rule .
dEDcc0aCjaA44,4.1,4.14,You ca n't tell them WHAT they 're going to get until you 've told them WHY they would
,,,want it .
dEDcc0aCjaA45,4.15,4.2,Your hook ha to be something that get them to BELIEVE that they want what you 're going
,,,to give them .
dEDcc0aCjaA46,4.22,4.27,Take a moment right now and write down WHY your presentation will make your audience
,,,more happy successful or free in their life .
dEDcc0aCjaA47,4.31,4.31,And now we move on to step number 4 which is to Introduce Your Agenda . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA48,4.31,4.41,I recommend you use a PowerPoint for this step and the slide should look something
,,,like this .
dEDcc0aCjaA49,4.44,4.48,The purpose of this step is to show your audience the takeaway for your presentation the
,,,thing they get to take away '' and use tomorrow after listening to your presentation .
dEDcc0aCjaA50,4.54,4.54,Do n't read the slide .
dEDcc0aCjaA51,4.55,4.55,They 're adult .
dEDcc0aCjaA52,4.56,4.56,They can read .
dEDcc0aCjaA53,4.57,5.01,Instead just give them a moment to read it themselves and introduce your agenda by summarizing
,,,what you 'll be doing .
dEDcc0aCjaA54,5.03,5.08,You do this by mentioning the number of takeaway you 'll be giving them and paraphrasing the
,,,goal of your presentation .
dEDcc0aCjaA55,5.09,5.11,Here 's what it look like :
,,,I 'm going to show you 5 step to deliver a killer opener . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA56,5.11,5.19,What would this look like for you ?
,,,The last step is Step 5 Give a Credible Statement .
dEDcc0aCjaA57,5.23,5.23,You can do this by giving relevant or compelling data to your audience to support your message .
dEDcc0aCjaA58,5.27,5.51,Remember how I did this at the beginning of this video ?
,,,I said You probably already know that delivering great presentation is critical to advance
,,,your career but did you know that research say that most adult will stop listening
,,,to your presentation within the first 10 minute if they are n't convinced there 's something
,,,in it for them ? ''
,,,When you do this within the first 2 minute of your presentation your audience start
,,,to trust you .
dEDcc0aCjaA59,5.53,5.58,Without bragging your listener start to think oooh this guy know what he 's talking
,,,about ''
,,,Done .
dEDcc0aCjaA60,5.59,6.03,When I put those 5 step together it sound like this :
,,,Hi I 'm Jason Teteak .
dEDcc0aCjaA61,6.05,6.14,I help people overcome their fear of public speaking and deliver amazing presentation
,,,and today I 'm going to show you how to captivate your audience within the first 5 minute of
,,,your presentation .

dEDcc0aCjaA63,6.16,6.17,I 'm going to show you 5 step to deliver a killer opener . ''
dEDcc0aCjaA64,6.17,6.4,You probably already know that delivering great presentation is critical to advance
,,,your career but did you know that research say that most adult will stop listening

ADJAcyTq1us24,3.43,3.52,are you making the presentation the
,,,need of the presentation need to be
,,,"clear, so you need to ask yourself"
,,,certain question ridge. You need to

ADJAcyTq1us26,3.56,4,What exactly are we trying to show to
,,,people? with the help? of this
,,,"presentation, your communication. need to"
ADJAcyTq1us27,4,4.04,"be clear, you should know the audience"

ADJAcyTq1us28,4.04,4.15,your presentation according to the
,,,"audience Well, a presentation is not"
,,,about you it is about the audience
,,,completely about the audience You need
,,,to understand what their expectation.
ADJAcyTq1us29,4.18,4.25,from this particular presentation is
,,,"what are their like? Their dislike, what"
,,,part of the society they are coming from
,,,and what kind
,,,language they speak. When you know Your
ADJAcyTq1us30,4.25,4.3,audience You will be able to completely
,,,tailor make according to their
,,,"requirement. You need to be concrete,"
ADJAcyTq1us31,4.31,4.39,"specific, practical and relevant, meaning"
,,,your presentation should not be out of
,,,"the box, which ha, to be whatever is the"
,,,requirement. You need to make your
ADJAcyTq1us32,4.41,4.47,"presentation around that, and your"
,,,presentation need to be brief and to
,,,the point. It should not be too elaborate
ADJAcyTq1us33,4.47,4.49,and it should not be over. You
ADJAcyTq1us34,4.49,5.13,"need to make It relevant, to the audience"
,,,"be clear, about your objective, whether"
,,,"your objective, of the presentation is to"
,,,motivate people to persuade people to
,,,inform them about something or draw the
,,,distance teach them about something You
,,,"need to be clear, and rather, I would say"
,,,be crystal clear on what is the purpose
,,,"of your presentation and accordingly, you"
,,,need to make your presentation research.
ADJAcyTq1us35,5.16,5.16,Your topic thoroughly. A presentation can
ADJAcyTq1us36,5.16,5.19,be a complete disaster.
ADJAcyTq1us37,5.22,5.28,If you Do not have researched your topic
,,,completely You need to know in and out
,,,about that topic. because you need to be
ADJAcyTq1us38,5.28,5.3,prepared completely and thoroughly. on
ADJAcyTq1us39,5.3,5.32,that topic. this my friend. is the first
ADJAcyTq1us40,5.32,5.32,
ADJAcyTq1us41,5.32,5.37,step of giving a good presentation know
,,,Your strategy or formulate your strategy.
ADJAcyTq1us42,5.4,5.43,"moving on to the second step, which is"
,,,developing of flexible and a flowing
,,,"structure. Now, once you know What is the"
ADJAcyTq1us43,5.45,5.58,purpose of your presentation you need to
,,,"make a structure around that, particular"
,,,"presentation let s look at this, step"
,,,after knowing what you Have to say you
,,,need to organize all the material in a
,,,very structured manner. You need to
ADJAcyTq1us44,5.58,5.58,"research. Your topic get all the data, but"
ADJAcyTq1us45,6,6.05,"with all this data, you can not give a"
,,,presentation you need to edit it. You
ADJAcyTq1us46,6.05,6.07,need to make It very very polished. Hence
ADJAcyTq1us47,6.07,6.13,you need to make It crystal clear do nt
,,,assume that information will speak. by
ADJAcyTq1us48,6.13,6.17,itself? You are the presenter and you
,,,need to speak. on that particular topic a
ADJAcyTq1us49,6.17,6.25,presentation will not talk by itself?
,,,Audience might interpret the information
,,,in different way. Everybody ha a
ADJAcyTq1us50,6.25,6.31,different mindset and what you are
,,,actually trying to say to a presentation
,,,"people? might not understand that, so It s"
,,,"important. You need to clear, It out to"
ADJAcyTq1us51,6.34,6.37,the audience what you
,,,to say about that topic. Think on how you
ADJAcyTq1us52,6.37,6.39,"can hold the attention. Hence, today the"
ADJAcyTq1us53,6.39,6.39,attention. span of people? is hardly
ADJAcyTq1us54,6.42,6.42,anything. People will look at you or
ADJAcyTq1us55,6.44,6.55,"rather, listen to you for only two to"
,,,three minute and then decide whether
,,,they actually want to listen to you or
,,,whether they want to switch off mentally
,,,"and physically. Listen to you Well, you"
ADJAcyTq1us56,6.55,6.57,need to hold the attention. of the

,,,about that later.
ADJAcyTq1us58,7.02,7.09,How can you justify your idea? Each and
,,,every idea of your topic that you Have
,,,put down need to be justified with a
,,,"relevant, factor or a figure. Think, from"
ADJAcyTq1us59,7.09,7.13,"the audience point. of view, when you are"
ADJAcyTq1us60,7.13,7.2,giving a presentation gather when you
,,,are actually structuring your
,,,presentation you need to Think from an
,,,"audience point. of view, meaning You need"
ADJAcyTq1us61,7.2,7.32,to wear the audience hat and sit there
,,,and Think whether the audience will
,,,really Enjoy listening to this
,,,particular presentation and how can you
,,,convince the audience Today is very
,,,difficult to convince people. They have
ADJAcyTq1us62,7.32,7.36,their own mindset about thing Hence it
,,,becomes important. how will you convince
ADJAcyTq1us63,7.36,7.47,the people is what you need to Think

V8eLdbKXGzk1,0.03,0.03,Hello everyone ! Welcome to public speaking .
V8eLdbKXGzk2,0.07,0.07,Today ’ s first presenter is Ranjit .
V8eLdbKXGzk3,0.1,0.1,And I would ask everyone to give him their full attention .
V8eLdbKXGzk4,0.14,0.29,Chantal could you dim the light please ?
,,,The British imposed a lot of unpopular tax on the American colonist
,,,and didn ’ t let them elect representative to the British government .
V8eLdbKXGzk5,0.34,0.34,In retaliation the Americans started to boycott British good .
V8eLdbKXGzk6,0.4,0.45,In 1773 Americans in Massachusetts dumped a shipload of
,,,British tea into Boston Harbor .
V8eLdbKXGzk7,0.48,0.48,This became known a the Boston Tea Party .
V8eLdbKXGzk8,1.01,1.06,As punishment the British imposed law known a the Intolerable Acts
,,,including the Quartering Act which made Americans let British soldier live in their home .
V8eLdbKXGzk9,1.12,1.17,Some of the American colony created a Declaration of Rights and Grievances
,,,which they sent to Britain .
V8eLdbKXGzk10,1.18,1.18,But the British just sent soldier to the colony to put down any rebellion .
V8eLdbKXGzk11,1.24,1.24,This led to the first battle of the revolution at Lexington and Concord .
V8eLdbKXGzk12,1.32,1.32,Thank you Ranjit .
V8eLdbKXGzk13,1.33,1.33,I know it ’ s very hard to give a presentation in front of the entire class .
V8eLdbKXGzk14,1.38,1.57,Now would anyone like to offer Ranjit constructive feedback about his presentation ?
,,,Any tip for what he might do differently next time ?
,,,For example were you all able to hear what Ranjit wa saying ?
,,,Not really ! He need to speak louder and face the audience .
V8eLdbKXGzk15,2.01,2.01,Yes great suggestion . Anyone else ?
V8eLdbKXGzk16,2.01,2.11,He wa reading from his paper so it didn ’ t feel like he wa really talking to u you know ?
,,,Exactly . It ’ s important when you ’ re speaking
V8eLdbKXGzk17,2.11,2.14,to look up every sentence or two and make eye contact with someone in the audience .
V8eLdbKXGzk18,2.2,2.29,Anything else that Ranjit could do to appear more relaxed and feel more confident ?
,,,He could smile more .
V8eLdbKXGzk19,2.3,2.3,Yes ! Smiling make u feel relaxed .
V8eLdbKXGzk20,2.34,2.41,Oh and make sure your phone is off before you speak next time !
,,,I do have one more suggestion .
V8eLdbKXGzk21,2.43,2.48,To connect with listener it ’ s a great idea to use a
,,,personal story or experience a an example .
V8eLdbKXGzk22,2.52,2.54,Can you try that next time ?
,,,I think so yes . Next week my presentation will be about the cause and effect of stress .
V8eLdbKXGzk23,2.54,2.54,
V8eLdbKXGzk24,3.01,3.1,We look forward to hearing it !
,,,Ranjit is first up again today and I look forward to his new presentation .
V8eLdbKXGzk25,3.15,3.22,Jorge could you dim the light please ?
,,,Good morning ! Today I ’ d like to talk about the cause and effect of stress
,,,and how to cope with stress .
V8eLdbKXGzk26,3.24,3.29,Stress ha many cause including work or school
,,,life event change or unrealistic expectation of yourself .
V8eLdbKXGzk27,3.35,3.4,Some effect of stress include headache trouble sleeping
,,,depression or lack of concentration .
V8eLdbKXGzk28,3.44,3.44,I know how hard it can be to deal with stress .
V8eLdbKXGzk29,3.46,3.46,Last year I started working after school to save for college .
V8eLdbKXGzk30,3.5,3.5,But I didn ’ t have time to do homework and my grade went down .
V8eLdbKXGzk31,3.54,3.56,I had trouble sleeping
,,,I only ate junk food and I stopped hanging out with my friend .
V8eLdbKXGzk32,4.01,4.01,Fortunately I wa able to talk with a school counselor to manage my stress .
V8eLdbKXGzk33,4.05,4.09,She suggested that I reduce my hour at my job eat healthy food
,,,and get some exercise .
V8eLdbKXGzk34,4.11,4.11,So I literally started walking home from school and bringing my lunch .
V8eLdbKXGzk35,4.15,4.15,I also asked my teacher for extra help .
V8eLdbKXGzk36,4.17,4.2,Now I feel better !
,,,It ’ s important to recognize when you are stressed and to ask for help . Thank you .
V8eLdbKXGzk37,4.2,4.2,
V8eLdbKXGzk38,4.33,4.35,Great work Ranjit !
,,,I want you all to reflect on how much stronger today ’ s presentation wa .
V8eLdbKXGzk39,4.42,4.49,Ranjit looked u in the eye
,,,he spoke clearly he smiled at u
,,,and he used a personal anecdote to help u feel more connected to him .
V8eLdbKXGzk40,4.56,4.56,Well done .
V8eLdbKXGzk41,4.57,4.57,Thank you sir .
wp4ho9raVjA1,0,0.09,"Not a long time ago, there wa this"
,,,"famous survey, which concluded that most"
,,,people fear public speaking more than
,,,"they feared death. The American comedian,"
wp4ho9raVjA2,0.09,0.23,"Jerry Seinfeld, summed up the statistic"
,,,"brilliantly when he said so, for the"
,,,"average person, if you go to a funeral,"
,,,you re better off in the casket than
,,,doing the eulogy that s funny right
,,,wrong. Speaking to an audience is
wp4ho9raVjA3,0.27,0.48,something two out of three people will
,,,do in their professional career so
,,,"which person, are you? Would you rather be"
,,,the one in the casket or the one
,,,delivering the eulogy the important
,,,thing to remember is that a presentation
,,,is a performance. A performance it need
wp4ho9raVjA4,0.48,1.11,an artist to WoW the audience so come
,,,along now pay attention and take your
,,,first step to becoming a presentation
,,,Ninja
,,,you
,,,like with any project. You can divide
wp4ho9raVjA5,1.11,1.14,your presentation. into three distinct
wp4ho9raVjA6,1.14,1.17,"phase: the planning phase, the"
,,,performance. phase: and the reflection
wp4ho9raVjA7,1.2,1.2,phase. Let s first look at the planning
wp4ho9raVjA8,1.22,1.34,"phase, the first step is to know your"
,,,audience because they ll be judging your
,,,performance learn a much a you can
,,,about your listener. Their bias and
wp4ho9raVjA9,1.34,1.44,Their expectation address your topic
,,,from the audience s perspective identify
,,,the presentation objective. The next
wp4ho9raVjA10,1.44,1.49,step is to outline your presentation. so
wp4ho9raVjA11,1.49,1.54,that you get a clear overview of it
,,,Content build your story like this. Tell
wp4ho9raVjA12,1.54,1.58,what you plan to talk about. Tell your
wp4ho9raVjA13,1.58,2.02,message or story Tell again what your
,,,presentation. wa about this. way. You
wp4ho9raVjA14,2.05,2.05,
wp4ho9raVjA15,2.05,2.08,deliver your key message. Three time
wp4ho9raVjA16,2.08,2.14,prepare a flowchart of how you plan to
,,,run your presentation. conceptualize and
wp4ho9raVjA17,2.14,2.17,then make it happen. Your idea only hold
wp4ho9raVjA18,2.17,2.24,value when you produce something
,,,effective using them. So when creating
wp4ho9raVjA19,2.24,2.35,"presentation remember to human decode,"
,,,visuals first and text last picture
,,,really do speak. A thousand word use
wp4ho9raVjA20,2.35,2.35,them. An important part of planning is
wp4ho9raVjA21,2.39,2.39,"practice. Preparing well, will help you"
wp4ho9raVjA22,2.42,2.45,stay calm and lessen the risk of failure.
wp4ho9raVjA23,2.49,2.54,Practice continuously to ensure you
,,,finish within the stipulated time and
,,,yet deliver An impactful message. the
wp4ho9raVjA24,2.54,2.59,next phase is the performance. phase:
wp4ho9raVjA25,2.59,3.06,"Clearly, state right at the start, where"
,,,you re headed with your presentation. if
wp4ho9raVjA26,3.06,3.22,"you re nervous, show video first, it will"
,,,"help you calm down,"
,,,make Your theme clear and consistent
,,,throughout the presentation always place
,,,your strongest point first and
,,,reiterate them in your summary.
wp4ho9raVjA27,3.25,3.28,Let s see a scenario from our virtual
,,,office good morning. Thank you so much

,,,this. software
wp4ho9raVjA31,3.46,3.58,open and close each section with a clear
,,,"transition at appropriate interval,"
,,,mention what you have covered and where
,,,you are about to go. Make it easy for
wp4ho9raVjA32,3.58,4.14,your audience to follow your story by

,,,to success. Let s return to the virtual
wp4ho9raVjA34,4.21,4.31,office this brings me to the end of the
,,,first part moving on to the next section
,,,"and personally, one of my favorite,"

wp4ho9raVjA41,4.5,5.22,you make the sale did you persuade the

wp4ho9raVjA43,5.28,5.39,"this can seem very scary, but it work"
,,,wonder: try to use the entire platform
,,,when you speak. it will also demand that
wp4ho9raVjA44,5.39,5.42,you practice. more and focus on Your
wp4ho9raVjA45,5.42,5.51,audience which is always good
,,,"human, have a very short attention span"
,,,"shortly after you, ve started your"
,,,presentation. your audience will begin to
wp4ho9raVjA46,5.54,6,wonder: when you finish so exactly ten
,,,minute into your presentation. do
wp4ho9raVjA47,6,6.12,something different a handy trick to
,,,overcome this lack of focus is by
,,,changing the scene and showing a video
,,,or handing out a sample. By doing that
wp4ho9raVjA48,6.12,6.18,or handing out a sample. By doing that
,,,you persuade the audience to refocus on
,,,you
d812a7qG9Kw1,0,0.02,The way you practice a presentation
,,,directly influence the outcome .
d812a7qG9Kw2,0.05,0.06,So in this video we 're going to talk about
,,,how to practice a speech .
d812a7qG9Kw3,0.09,0.09,Let 's get into those detail .
d812a7qG9Kw4,0.15,0.15,Hello there friend .
d812a7qG9Kw5,0.16,0.2,Alex Lyon and we are at the end of a three series
,,,on public speaking this month .
d812a7qG9Kw6,0.22,0.22,The first video is on the importance of public speaking .
d812a7qG9Kw7,0.24,0.27,The one before this is on how to improve
,,,and this one is specifically on how to practice a speech .
d812a7qG9Kw8,0.3,0.39,So let 's get into the five way
,,,that I recommend you practicing a speech
,,,and at the end of this video you may wan na stick around
,,,because I have a couple of resource to suggest
,,,to help you move your public speaking to the next level .
d812a7qG9Kw9,0.42,0.44,So the first way to practice a speech
,,,is to practice from an outline .
d812a7qG9Kw10,0.48,0.48,Not word for word note .
d812a7qG9Kw11,0.5,0.51,I 've given some version of this tip
,,,in a lot of different video but let 's say it clearly .
d812a7qG9Kw12,0.54,1.01,You must practice from an outline a bare bone outline
,,,if you want to sound conversational
,,,which is really what your listener want from you .
d812a7qG9Kw13,1.03,1.06,They do n't want you to read your speech
,,,they do n't want you to sound like you 've memorized it .
d812a7qG9Kw14,1.08,1.08,They want a conversation .
d812a7qG9Kw15,1.09,1.09,And the way to get there is this .
d812a7qG9Kw16,1.11,1.25,You take whatever note you have to prepare at first
,,,your first few draft
,,,and then you just keep cutting them down over and over again
,,,every time you practice
,,,until all you 're left with is a bulleted outline
,,,of your key point that you are going to hit .
d812a7qG9Kw17,1.27,1.27,That 's all you really want in the end .
d812a7qG9Kw18,1.29,1.32,And that way you have a safety net to fall back on
,,,so you wo n't ever lose your place .
d812a7qG9Kw19,1.34,1.37,You can just glance down at your note
,,,and then bounce your eye right back up
,,,and present from an outline .
d812a7qG9Kw20,1.39,1.39,That 's the best way .
d812a7qG9Kw21,1.4,1.41,Practice from an outline
,,,and in the end present like an outline .
d812a7qG9Kw22,1.43,1.53,One of the thing I will do in fact is
,,,so I do n't sound like I 've memorized it
,,,I do n't sound like a robot
,,,is every time I practice
,,,I might say it a little differently on purpose
,,,so that I 'm not tempted to memorize .
d812a7qG9Kw23,1.55,1.55,So do n't try to put it word for word do n't try to memorize .
d812a7qG9Kw24,1.59,1.59,Talking point only and practice from that kind of outline .
d812a7qG9Kw25,2.02,2.04,The number two tip on how to practice
,,,is to spread out your practice session over time .
d812a7qG9Kw26,2.08,2.08,Do n't cram the night before .
d812a7qG9Kw27,2.1,2.1,Do n't cram the morning before your presentation .
d812a7qG9Kw28,2.13,2.15,I recommend spreading your practice session out
,,,over three day .
d812a7qG9Kw29,2.16,2.2,The idea is to practice about three time each day
,,,over those three day .
d812a7qG9Kw30,2.21,2.25,I like to practice about 10 time
,,,before I stand up and speak
,,,and it 's really easier to do if you spread it out .
d812a7qG9Kw31,2.28,2.3,A lot of great thing happen
,,,when you spread out your practice session .
d812a7qG9Kw32,2.32,2.32,The first thing that happens to me is it calm me down .
d812a7qG9Kw33,2.35,2.35,It say to me hey there 's time .
d812a7qG9Kw34,2.37,2.41,So if my earliest few practice session practice time
,,,do n't go so well I say hey there 's time .
d812a7qG9Kw35,2.43,2.43,No problem I got a few more day .
d812a7qG9Kw36,2.44,2.44,I 'll work out these kink .
d812a7qG9Kw37,2.46,2.49,Another great thing that happens is
,,,let 's say I 've practiced it three time
,,,and then I sleep on it .
d812a7qG9Kw38,2.51,2.59,Oftentimes in the middle of the day
,,,I 'm doing other thing I 'm washing dish
,,,my brain keep working on it
,,,and keep figuring out better way to say something
,,,or a quicker way to get to the point .
d812a7qG9Kw39,3.01,3.06,So in that downtime I believe that our brain
,,,are still working on it
,,,and we benefit from that downtime a well .
d812a7qG9Kw40,3.08,3.12,The other great thing about breaking up
,,,your practice session is it help me
,,,with my composure in the moment .
d812a7qG9Kw41,3.14,3.18,Because it feel to me like muscle memory with an athlete
,,,that I 've done this before .
d812a7qG9Kw42,3.2,3.2,I 've been doing this presentation for day .
d812a7qG9Kw43,3.22,3.22,So it really help me stay composed and in the moment .
d812a7qG9Kw44,3.25,3.28,So spread out those practice session three time a day
,,,over three day .
d812a7qG9Kw45,3.29,3.29,That usually is about what you need .
d812a7qG9Kw46,3.31,3.36,The number three tip is to focus
,,,on only one or two improvement
,,,each time you practice it through .
d812a7qG9Kw47,3.39,3.41,So you might just work on your structure and your outline
,,,in the first few time through that 's normal .
d812a7qG9Kw48,3.44,3.48,The next few time through just pick one or two thing
,,,like oh now I 'm just gon na work on looking up
,,,form my outline eye contact for example .
d812a7qG9Kw49,3.5,3.53,The next time through you might just work on gesture
,,,and your posture a little bit .
d812a7qG9Kw50,3.54,4.14,Every time you practice
,,,add one or two thing you wan na improve on
,,,because when you add too many thing all at once
,,,when you try to get it perfect every time you practice
,,,you 're going to get paralyzed
,,,because you ca n't really improve more than one thing
,,,or maybe two thing in any given practice session
,,,so focus on improvement
,,,and then start checking those off the list .
d812a7qG9Kw51,4.16,4.18,And then your fundamental will all be in place
,,,by the time you actually stand up to present .
d812a7qG9Kw52,4.21,4.21,Number four tip is to keep practice session realistic .
d812a7qG9Kw53,4.26,4.29,Do not for example the whole time you 're practicing
,,,isolate yourself completely and make condition perfect .
d812a7qG9Kw54,4.34,4.37,Because what end up happening in the moment
,,,of your actual presentation is it wo n't go perfectly .
d812a7qG9Kw55,4.39,4.45,People will walk in late
,,,or they 'll get up to use the bathroom
,,,or there 'll be somebody
,,,with a lawn mower outside your window .
d812a7qG9Kw56,4.47,4.52,In fact I 've been recording this morning
,,,and there is a neighbor working with a chainsaw nearby
,,,that keep distracting me but you just power through it .
d812a7qG9Kw57,4.55,4.59,So after a few time practicing alone
,,,what I end up doing when I practice
,,,is I add distraction on purpose .
d812a7qG9Kw58,5.02,5.14,Like I will put the television or some music on
,,,and then I 'll talk over that
,,,because it creates a little bit of noise
,,,and distraction for me to cope with
,,,and I know that if I can practice through those distraction
,,,that during the actual moment I 'll be ready to push through .
d812a7qG9Kw59,5.17,5.18,Even if something weird or odd happens
,,,it wo n't throw me off a much .
d812a7qG9Kw60,5.2,5.2,So keep practice session realistic .
d812a7qG9Kw61,5.23,5.28,And the number five tip is to visualize the first 30 second
,,,and the last 30 second of your presentation .
d812a7qG9Kw62,5.3,5.3,So by visualization I mean the way a sport athlete doe it .
d812a7qG9Kw63,5.34,5.4,So you picture yourself walking up
,,,through that first 30 second of the moment
,,,starting off your presentation
,,,and then the last 30 second how you 're gon na close .
d812a7qG9Kw64,5.43,5.43,So athlete do this with great success .
d812a7qG9Kw65,5.46,5.55,There is a study by Laure Ecard published in the 1980s
,,,and a lot of other study like it
,,,on basketball free throw shooting
,,,and they found people that only visualized
,,,actually did improve a little bit .
d812a7qG9Kw66,5.57,6,People who practiced free throw basketball free throw
,,,improved a little more .
d812a7qG9Kw67,6.01,6.05,But athlete who did both

,,,be plenty of time for question: at the
,,,end of my presentation.
bgFNTuRYtKE26,3.07,3.07,or appreciate it. If you could leave
bgFNTuRYtKE27,3.07,3.12,any question you may have
,,,until the end of my presentation.
bgFNTuRYtKE28,3.15,3.23,"on the other hand, if you want to be"
,,,flexible and Welcome question: at any
,,,"time,"
,,,you could say something like This if you
,,,have any question during the
,,,presentation.
bgFNTuRYtKE29,3.26,3.33,"feel free to interrupt at any time,"
,,,"great, so made your introduction"
,,,"and now, it time to start with the main"
,,,part.
bgFNTuRYtKE30,3.36,3.41,or the body of your presentation and
,,,This is where sign posting phrase can
,,,be very useful.
bgFNTuRYtKE31,3.43,3.46,These are phrase we use to guide our
,,,audience through
,,,our presentation. to Let them know when
bgFNTuRYtKE32,3.46,3.55,we want to introduce a new topic
,,,when we finished with a topic and
,,,when we want to continue
,,,with the next one. Introducing your first
bgFNTuRYtKE33,3.55,4.18,"point,"
,,,like to begin by telling you
,,,"or showing you and so on, important"
,,,here
,,,to follow begin by with a gerund
,,,with the in form or
,,,Let start with or
,,,so let get started. so
bgFNTuRYtKE34,4.18,4.21,is a very short and simple word. But
bgFNTuRYtKE35,4.21,5,a very effective way to get your
,,,audience attention
,,,finishing one topic so that cover
,,,"everything i want to say about, or"
,,,that concludes my first or that
,,,"concludes my Second,"
,,,topic and continuing with another
,,,"now, Let move on to my next topic which"
,,,is
,,,or Let turn now to
,,,or moving on to
,,,and If you want to show your audience
,,,some information on
,,,graph or chart. The following phrase
bgFNTuRYtKE36,5,5.06,should be quite helpful:
,,,a you can see on This chart. or
bgFNTuRYtKE37,5.06,5.1,take a look at This chart. or
bgFNTuRYtKE38,5.1,5.22,This graph clearly show
,,,or This graph highlight the importance
,,,of
,,,sometimes important to go into more
,,,detail.
bgFNTuRYtKE39,5.26,5.26,Let have a look at a couple of way. We
bgFNTuRYtKE40,5.26,5.35,can do this
,,,"Let me expand on This point, or"
,,,"i like to elaborate on This point, for"
,,,a few minute.
bgFNTuRYtKE41,5.38,5.58,also very important to remind your
,,,audience about the purpose of your
,,,presentation
,,,Why important and Why relevant
,,,a i said at the beginning
,,,or This relates to what i wa saying
,,,"earlier,"
,,,or This tie in with what i said at the
,,,start of my talk
,,,or at the start of my presentation. If
bgFNTuRYtKE42,5.58,6.03,"something tie in with something else,"
,,,"it mean the two thing, are connected."
bgFNTuRYtKE43,6.07,6.1,"Excellent now, Let think about the last"
,,,part of the presentation.
bgFNTuRYtKE44,6.11,6.17,here we usually summarize the main
,,,"point, give a conclusion or a final"
,,,message
,,,thank the audience and invite them to.
bgFNTuRYtKE45,6.19,6.19,ask question:
,,,summarizing. So that brings me to the end
bgFNTuRYtKE46,6.21,6.24,of my presentation.
bgFNTuRYtKE47,6.26,6.33,"We looked at three main point,"
,,,First i showed you or i spoke about
,,,"followed by a one. or two sentence,"
bgFNTuRYtKE48,6.33,6.4,summary

XA1o5rvy8r41,0,0,This episode contains abbreviated language with dubious meaning .
XA1o5rvy8r42,0.03,0.03,It 's for instructional purpose only .
XA1o5rvy8r43,0.06,0.06,Do n't repeat at work .
XA1o5rvy8r44,0.07,0.11,Today I want to share with you three tip
,,,that helped me make more effective
,,,PowerPoint slide and deliver better presentation .
XA1o5rvy8r45,0.14,0.23,So if you go to a lot of internal company meeting and you need to present at
,,,some of them
,,,so either to your team or your management or you 're a consultant that need to
,,,pitch a product or service to another company these tip can help you .
XA1o5rvy8r46,0.27,0.32,They actually stem from my own mistake and these are the tip that I personally
,,,use to improve my presentation .
XA1o5rvy8r47,0.34,0.35,Number one
,,,simplicity is not the enemy of detail .
XA1o5rvy8r48,0.39,0.41,In fact a stated by Davinci
,,,simplicity is the ultimate sophistication .
XA1o5rvy8r49,0.44,0.44,Slides are there to help deliver your message .
XA1o5rvy8r410,0.47,0.47,They are n't there for you to remember your text .
XA1o5rvy8r411,0.5,0.52,They 're for your audience
,,,not for you .
XA1o5rvy8r412,0.53,0.53,This wa a big problem area for me when I created slide .
XA1o5rvy8r413,0.57,1.01,When I went to a meeting I took with me one thing
,,,my slide
,,,they were my cue point . They were also my handout .
XA1o5rvy8r414,1.01,1.01,
XA1o5rvy8r415,1.05,1.1,It wa like a three in one deal except that it wa only a good deal for me
,,,but not for my audience .
XA1o5rvy8r416,1.12,1.16,I used to add one bullet point after another because I did n't want to forget
,,,something . What happened wa I ended up with crowded
XA1o5rvy8r417,1.16,1.28,intimidating slide slide that no one could or wanted to read
,,,not only where they 're distracting cause who can read and listen at the same
,,,time but I started to lose people 's attention .
XA1o5rvy8r418,1.31,1.31,They started to think about their dinner and fitness plan .
XA1o5rvy8r419,1.34,1.34,Something you probably do n't want to encourage while you 're presenting .
XA1o5rvy8r420,1.38,1.43,One complicated slide take the same amount of time to present a three simple
,,,slide . It 's a question of pacing your communication .
XA1o5rvy8r421,1.43,1.43,
XA1o5rvy8r422,1.47,1.51,It 's about giving them the right amount of information in the order they need to
,,,understand it .
XA1o5rvy8r423,1.52,1.52,The difference is the complicated slide confuses and distracts the viewer .
XA1o5rvy8r424,1.57,1.59,Whereas with the simple one
,,,they 're likely to stay on and get your message .
XA1o5rvy8r425,2.02,2.05,Now when I attend an important meeting
,,,I take with me three thing .
XA1o5rvy8r426,2.07,2.07,I have my cue card which help me remember my point .
XA1o5rvy8r427,2.1,2.1,I have my slide which help my audience .
XA1o5rvy8r428,2.12,2.16,Remember the most important point and I have the detailed handout that help
,,,them get more detail if they want .
XA1o5rvy8r429,2.18,2.22,If you 're not sure whether your slide are simple enough or not
,,,here 's the test you can do . If you gave your PowerPoint
XA1o5rvy8r430,2.22,2.29,to your neighbor and you ask them
,,,go to the meeting and press next next next
,,,on the slide . Will it make sense to your audience ?
XA1o5rvy8r431,2.29,2.33,If yes that 's not a PowerPoint presentation .
XA1o5rvy8r432,2.36,2.36,Those are your handout .
XA1o5rvy8r433,2.38,2.38,Your slide should n't make sense without you .
XA1o5rvy8r434,2.41,2.42,Number two
,,,the use of acronym . Do they help or hurt ?
XA1o5rvy8r435,2.42,2.55,If you 're in a finance meeting and you say
,,,let 's take a look at the BS you 've been working on
,,,probably people will understand you mean balance sheet and you 're not trying to
,,,be offensive but it 's not always clear . When I working in a team
XA1o5rvy8r436,2.55,3.07,on an Oracle project setting up a group finance consolidation system
,,,we had to create the backbone structure
,,,which is called the Metadata of the system .
XA1o5rvy8r437,3.1,3.14,One task wa to set up different hierarchy
,,,for our company structure and all
,,,of them had code name like no space short word sometimes number .
XA1o5rvy8r438,3.19,3.24,One request we got wa to set up separate structure for our European and American
,,,company . The code to use wa A. N. A. L Europe
XA1o5rvy8r439,3.24,3.24,
XA1o5rvy8r440,3.24,3.24,A. N. A. L America .
XA1o5rvy8r441,3.28,3.28,
XA1o5rvy8r442,3.29,3.29,A.N . A.L standing for analysis .
XA1o5rvy8r443,3.29,3.29,
XA1o5rvy8r444,3.32,3.32,Some word just should n't be shorted .
XA1o5rvy8r445,3.34,3.34,You can either entirely replace them or use the full word .
XA1o5rvy8r446,3.39,3.42,So going back to your use of acronym in a meeting
,,,you want to make sure that you do n't unintentionally offend someone .
XA1o5rvy8r447,3.47,3.47,And you do n't exclude anyone because they do n't understand what it mean .
XA1o5rvy8r448,3.5,3.56,So make sure you emphasize what these are in the handout and also on the slide
,,,if you 're using them in there .
XA1o5rvy8r449,3.59,3.59,Number three branding .
XA1o5rvy8r450,4.01,4.04,Are you getting excessive with your branding ?
,,,The company I worked for always had their logo on every single slide .
XA1o5rvy8r451,4.09,4.09,When I started to work on my own that 's what I did .
XA1o5rvy8r452,4.11,4.11,I put my logo on every single slide prominently featured on top .
XA1o5rvy8r453,4.16,4.19,I believed that wa the professional thing to do
,,,but when I started to make simpler slide that logo wa so distracting .
XA1o5rvy8r454,4.24,4.24,It looked bigger than ever .
XA1o5rvy8r455,4.26,4.4,Before I did n't even notice it so much because the slide wa so full
,,,but when it started to get empty
,,,I started to question the placement of any image or object on that slide
,,,and I asked doe it bring any added value ?
,,,Well it did n't . It wa distracting .
XA1o5rvy8r456,4.4,4.4,
XA1o5rvy8r457,4.42,4.42,I do n't need my logo on every single page .
XA1o5rvy8r458,4.45,4.45,It 's enough to put it on the first and the last page .
XA1o5rvy8r459,4.48,4.5,And if you 're concerned about piracy
,,,you can use a light watermark in the footer and make it small .
XA1o5rvy8r460,4.53,4.53,That 's what I do .
XA1o5rvy8r461,4.54,4.54,Think about this slide you use for your internal meeting .
XA1o5rvy8r462,4.58,5.06,Do you have the logo on every single slide ? Does it bring any added value ?
,,,So these were my three tip that help me make better PowerPoint slide
,,,and more effective presentation .
XA1o5rvy8r463,5.09,5.09,I hope you found them helpful .
XA1o5rvy8r464,5.1,5.1,I 'm curious to hear what you think . Also
XA1o5rvy8r465,5.1,5.17,what do you most struggle with when you make PowerPoint presentation ?
,,,Let me know in the comment below . Thank you for watching .
XA1o5rvy8r466,5.17,5.17,
XA1o5rvy8r467,5.21,5.21,See you in the next video .
XA1o5rvy8r468,5.27,5.27,Yeah .
fzIxD1jXn441,0.01,0.01,Hi I ’ m Gina .
fzIxD1jXn442,0.03,0.06,Welcome to Oxford Online English !
,,,In this lesson you can learn how to make a presentation in English .
fzIxD1jXn443,0.1,0.14,Do you have to make presentation in English in your job ?
,,,Imagine you have to give an important presentation in English tomorrow .
fzIxD1jXn444,0.18,0.31,How would you feel about it ?
,,,This lesson will help you learn useful phrase and technique to introduce yourself and your
,,,topic keep your idea organised deal with problem and respond to question from audience
,,,member .
fzIxD1jXn445,0.32,0.32,Imagine you ’ re standing in front of your colleague .
fzIxD1jXn446,0.36,0.36,You need to introduce yourself and what your presentation is about .
fzIxD1jXn447,0.42,0.52,What are some word and phrase you could use ?
,,,If some people in the audience don ’ t know who you are you should introduce yourself
,,,and your position .
fzIxD1jXn448,0.54,0.59,In a more formal setting you could say something like this :
,,,Good morning everyone .
fzIxD1jXn449,1,1,For those who don ’ t know me my name ’ s Simon and I work in the marketing department .
fzIxD1jXn4410,1.05,1.05,Or : Hello everybody .
fzIxD1jXn4411,1.07,1.07,Before we begin let me introduce myself briefly : I ’ m Reese and I ’ m the head of HR .
fzIxD1jXn4412,1.13,1.18,If you work in a more informal company you could say :
,,,Hi guy ; if you don ’ t know me I ’ m Sylvia and I work in digital marketing .
fzIxD1jXn4413,1.24,1.31,Or : Hello !
,,,I see some new face so I ’ ll introduce myself first : I ’ m Julia and I ’ m one of
,,,our customer service team .
fzIxD1jXn4414,1.34,1.34,Next you need to introduce your topic .
fzIxD1jXn4415,1.38,1.42,If your presentation topic is simpler you could just say one sentence like this :
,,,Today I ’ m going to be talking about our new HR policy and how they affect you .
fzIxD1jXn4416,1.48,1.54,Or : I ’ d like to talk to you today about quality control and why we ’ re all responsible
,,,for quality control whichever department you work in .
fzIxD1jXn4417,1.58,1.58,If your topic is more complex you might add more detail to break your idea into stage .
fzIxD1jXn4418,2.06,2.11,For example : I ’ ll begin by outlining the policy and
,,,then I ’ ll go on to highlight what they mean for you and your working habit .
fzIxD1jXn4419,2.16,2.23,Finally I ’ ll briefly discus why we feel these new policy are necessary and beneficial
,,,for u all .
fzIxD1jXn4420,2.25,2.29,Here ’ s another example : First of all I ’ ll explain why ‘ quality
,,,control ’ ha a broader meaning than you might expect .
fzIxD1jXn4421,2.32,2.37,I ’ ll continue by giving example of real quality control and why this matter for
,,,all of u .
fzIxD1jXn4422,2.39,2.43,To finish I ’ ll be asking you to think of way you can incorporate quality control into
,,,your working habit .
fzIxD1jXn4423,2.44,2.44,Here you saw two example .
fzIxD1jXn4424,2.48,3.15,You can use these a template to begin your presentation :
,,,I ’ ll begin by… and then I ’ ll…
,,,Finally I ’ ll…
,,,Or : First of all I ’ ll…
,,,I ’ ll continue by…
,,,To finish I ’ ll…
,,,Okay now you can practice !
,,,We ’ d like you to do two thing .
fzIxD1jXn4425,3.19,3.26,First practice introducing yourself informally and explaining your topic in a simple way
,,,with one sentence .
fzIxD1jXn4426,3.3,3.37,Then practice introducing yourself formally and explaining your topic in a more detailed
,,,way .
fzIxD1jXn4427,3.39,3.39,Pause the video and practice speaking .
fzIxD1jXn4428,3.43,3.43,All the language you need is in this section .
fzIxD1jXn4429,3.47,3.54,Ready ?
,,,Let ’ s move on !
,,,I ’ m sure that in your life you ’ ve heard good speaker and bad speaker .
fzIxD1jXn4430,3.59,3.59,Good speaker grab your attention and don ’ t let go .
fzIxD1jXn4431,4.02,4.02,You want to hear what they have to say .
fzIxD1jXn4432,4.05,4.05,You feel interested and energised by listening to them .
fzIxD1jXn4433,4.09,4.09,Bad speaker are the opposite .
fzIxD1jXn4434,4.11,4.11,Even if you try to make yourself listen you find that your attention drift away .
fzIxD1jXn4435,4.16,4.16,Your eyelid feel heavy and you have to struggle to stay awake .
fzIxD1jXn4436,4.2,4.33,So here ’ s a question : what ’ s the difference between good speaker and bad speaker ?
,,,And how can you make sure you speak effectively when you make your presentation in English ?
,,,Here ’ s one way to think about it : bad speaker don ’ t think they have to earn your attention .
fzIxD1jXn4437,4.41,4.48,Good speaker understand that no one ha to listen to them so they work hard to make
,,,you want to pay attention .
fzIxD1jXn4438,4.51,4.57,What doe this mean for you and your presentation ?
,,,Getting people ’ s attention start from the beginning .
fzIxD1jXn4439,5.01,5.07,You need to make it clear what people should expect from your presentation and why they
,,,should care about what you have to say .
fzIxD1jXn4440,5.11,5.16,Sounds like a nice idea but how do you do this ?
,,,Here are three technique you can use .
fzIxD1jXn4441,5.18,5.18,One : establish a problem which many people in your audience have .
fzIxD1jXn4442,5.23,5.23,Then establish that you have a solution to their problem .
fzIxD1jXn4443,5.28,5.41,For example :
,,,Have you ever felt unfairly treated at work or felt that the work you do isn ’ t appreciated ?
,,,We ’ ve been working to design new HR policy that will make sure all staff get fair recognition
,,,for their contribution to the company .
fzIxD1jXn4444,5.45,5.51,In this way you take a boring topic like HR policy and you make it more relevant
,,,to your audience .
fzIxD1jXn4445,5.53,5.54,How ?
,,,By connecting it with their experience and feeling .
fzIxD1jXn4446,5.58,6,The second technique ?
,,,Mention an interesting fact or a surprising statistic to get people ’ s attention .
fzIxD1jXn4447,6.07,6.25,For example :
,,,Did you know that the average office worker spends eight hour a day at work but only
,,,doe four hour of productive useful work ?
,,,I ’ m here to tell you about ‘ quality control ’ and how you can use this idea to make better
,,,use of your time .
fzIxD1jXn4448,6.27,6.27,Finally you can engage people by telling a short story and connecting it to your topic .
fzIxD1jXn4449,6.33,6.37,Stories are powerful and they can add an emotional dimension to your topic if you do
,,,it well .
fzIxD1jXn4450,6.39,6.41,For example :
,,,I once met a young salesman—I won ’ t mention his name .
fzIxD1jXn4451,6.45,6.45,He spent several week building a relationship with a potential client .
fzIxD1jXn4452,6.48,6.53,He worked overtime and he wa working so hard that he wa under severe stress which
,,,started to affect his personal life .
fzIxD1jXn4453,6.56,6.56,In the end he didn ’ t close the deal—the client signed with another firm .
fzIxD1jXn4454,7.01,7.06,Today I ’ m going to talk about confidence a a sale tool and how you can avoid the
,,,trap that this young man fell into .
fzIxD1jXn4455,7.11,7.16,Use one of these three technique in your introduction to connect with your audience
,,,and show them why they should be interested in what you have to say .
fzIxD1jXn4456,7.2,7.26,Here ’ s a question for you : which technique would you prefer to use and why ?
,,,Okay now you ’ ve introduced your topic and you have everyone ’ s attention .
fzIxD1jXn4457,7.31,7.45,What next ?
,,,There ’ s a famous quote about making presentation :
,,,“ Tell the audience what you ’ re going to say ; say it and then tell them what you ’ ve
,,,said . ”
fzIxD1jXn4458,7.45,7.51,Have you heard this before ?
,,,Do you know who said it ?
,,,This come from Dale Carnegie a very successful American salesman and writer .
fzIxD1jXn4459,7.58,7.58,He lived a long time ago but his advice is still relevant today .
fzIxD1jXn4460,8.03,8.09,So here ’ s a question : what doe the quote mean ?
,,,It mean that your presentation shouldn ’ t just give information .
fzIxD1jXn4461,8.13,8.13,You also need to show people how your information is organized .
fzIxD1jXn4462,8.18,8.18,To do this you need signposting language .
fzIxD1jXn4463,8.22,8.22,Let me give you an example to explain .
fzIxD1jXn4464,8.25,8.25,Imagine you go to a website .
fzIxD1jXn4465,8.27,8.27,The website is full of really useful interesting information .
fzIxD1jXn4466,8.31,8.31,But the information is all on one page .
fzIxD1jXn4467,8.34,8.39,There ’ s no organization and you have to scroll up and down up and down this huge
,,,page trying to find what you need .
fzIxD1jXn4468,8.43,8.46,Would you stay on that website ?
,,,Probably not .
fzIxD1jXn4469,8.47,8.47,You ’ ll find a website which make it easier for you to find the information you need .
fzIxD1jXn4470,8.51,8.54,What ’ s the point here ?
,,,The point is that having interesting or relevant information is not enough .
fzIxD1jXn4471,9,9,How you structure and organize your information is equally important .
fzIxD1jXn4472,9.05,9.11,If you don ’ t structure your presentation clearly people won ’ t pay attention just
,,,like you won ’ t stay on a website if you can ’ t find the information you want .
fzIxD1jXn4473,9.16,9.2,So how can you do this ?
,,,You use signposting language .
fzIxD1jXn4474,9.23,9.31,This mean using word and phrase to show the audience where your point begin and end
,,,to show what ’ s coming next and to remind them about thing you talked about before .
fzIxD1jXn4475,9.37,9.38,For example :
,,,Okay that cover the new policy .
fzIxD1jXn4476,9.41,9.41,Next I ’ d like to move on and discus what these policy mean for you .
fzIxD1jXn4477,9.47,9.52,Or : Now that you ’ ve heard a bit about what not to do let ’ s focus on positive advice
,,,to help you be more effective salesperson and close more of your lead .
fzIxD1jXn4478,9.58,10.02,When you say something like this you aren ’ t giving people information about the topic
,,,of your presentation .
fzIxD1jXn4479,10.03,10.03,Instead you ’ re showing people where you are and where you ’ re going next .
fzIxD1jXn4480,10.08,10.08,It ’ s a kind of signpost .
fzIxD1jXn4481,10.11,10.15,You don ’ t need signpost to travel from one place to another but they can make it
,,,easier .
fzIxD1jXn4482,10.17,10.21,What else can you use signposting language for ?
,,,You can use signposting language to move from one point to the next .
fzIxD1jXn4483,10.27,10.53,For example :
,,,Next I ’ d like to talk about…
,,,Let ’ s move on and discuss…
,,,Or : At this point I ’ d like to turn to…
,,,You can use signposting language to add detail to an idea :
,,,Let me go into some more detail about…
,,,Let ’ s examine … in more depth .
fzIxD1jXn4484,10.56,11.09,Or : I ’ d like to elaborate on…
,,,You can use signposting language to show that you ’ ve finished your main point and you ’ ve
,,,reached your conclusion :
,,,To wrap up let ’ s remind ourselves of why this should matter to everyone here .
fzIxD1jXn4485,11.17,11.17,Let ’ s review the key point from this session .
fzIxD1jXn4486,11.21,11.21,So you ’ ve heard what I have to say .
fzIxD1jXn4487,11.25,11.3,What conclusion can you take away from this ?
,,,If you have an important presentation in English practice using signposting language .
fzIxD1jXn4488,11.37,11.43,Use signposting language to move between point to show when you ’ re giving a summary or
,,,going into more detail and to signal that you ’ ve reached your conclusion .
fzIxD1jXn4489,11.49,11.49,Okay but thing don ’ t always go so smoothly in real life .
fzIxD1jXn4490,11.56,11.58,We know that !
,,,Let ’ s look at some advice and language for dealing with problem during your presentation .
fzIxD1jXn4491,12.07,12.07,Imagine you ’ re making your presentation in English .
fzIxD1jXn4492,12.1,12.18,What could go wrong ?
,,,What problem could you have ?
,,,There are many common problem :
,,,You might forget where you were or forget an important word .
fzIxD1jXn4493,12.21,12.21,You might realise that you said something wrong or you didn ’ t explain something clearly .
fzIxD1jXn4494,12.27,12.27,You might forget to mention something important .
fzIxD1jXn4495,12.29,12.29,Or someone might ask you an awkward question which you have no idea how to answer .
fzIxD1jXn4496,12.35,12.38,Of course there are other possibility !
,,,Let ’ s think about these problem .
fzIxD1jXn4497,12.4,12.54,What can you do and more importantly what can you say in these situation ?
,,,First of all it ’ s a good idea to make a cue card with key point a well a any important
,,,vocabulary you need .
fzIxD1jXn4498,12.56,12.56,If you lose your place or you forget a word it could help .
fzIxD1jXn4499,13.01,13.01,However you can ’ t prepare for everything .
fzIxD1jXn44100,13.05,13.05,So it ’ s useful to learn some phrase to deal with problem smoothly .
fzIxD1jXn44101,13.12,13.28,If you lose your place and can ’ t remember what to say next you can use a filler phrase
,,,like :
,,,Where wa I ?
,,,So what wa I saying ?
,,,What ’ s the word in English again ?
,,,If you still can ’ t remember look at your cue card with your main point .
fzIxD1jXn44102,13.35,13.35,Of course forgetting something isn ’ t ideal .
fzIxD1jXn44103,13.39,13.39,But if you do it ’ s better to keep talking rather than just standing there in silence .
fzIxD1jXn44104,13.47,13.55,What if you make a mistake or you realise that you didn ’ t explain something well ?
,,,You could say :
,,,Let me rephrase that .
fzIxD1jXn44105,13.57,14.2,Actually what I meant to say is…
,,,To clarify I wanted to say that…
,,,In this way you can correct yourself without admitting that you made a mistake !
,,,What if you realise that you forgot to mention something important ?
,,,Use a phrase like this :
,,,Let me just add one more thing : …
,,,I ’ d like to add something to a point we discussed earlier .
fzIxD1jXn44106,14.26,14.26,Let me return to an earlier point briefly .
fzIxD1jXn44107,14.29,14.36,Again this allows you to correct your mistake in a confident way so you look like you ’ re
,,,in control .
fzIxD1jXn44108,14.38,14.47,Finally what do you do if someone asks you a difficult question which you can ’ t answer ?
,,,You have a few option .
fzIxD1jXn44109,14.48,14.48,First you can delay giving an answer .
fzIxD1jXn44110,14.52,14.58,For example :
,,,I ’ ve allocated time for question at the end of this session so we ’ ll address your
,,,idea later .
fzIxD1jXn44111,14.59,15.04,Or : I ’ m not in a position to answer that right now but I ’ ll get back to you later
,,,this week .
fzIxD1jXn44112,15.06,15.18,This give you time to think of an answer and do some research if you have to !
,,,Next you can deflect the question by asking a question back or maybe by asking other
,,,audience member what they think .
fzIxD1jXn44113,15.21,15.22,For example :
,,,That ’ s an interesting question .
fzIxD1jXn44114,15.25,15.3,Before I answer I ’ d like to know : what ’ s your take on this ?
,,,Or : You ’ ve raised an important point there .
fzIxD1jXn44115,15.34,15.37,What doe everyone else think about this ?
,,,Finally if the question is irrelevant you can dismiss the question and move on .
fzIxD1jXn44116,15.43,15.44,For example :
,,,Thanks for your input but I don ’ t see how that ’ s connected to what I ’ m saying .
fzIxD1jXn44117,15.49,15.49,I don ’ t mean to be blunt but I don ’ t think that ’ s relevant to today ’ s discussion .
fzIxD1jXn44118,15.56,16.02,Notice how you can use phrase like thanks for your input but… or I don ’ t mean to
,,,be blunt but… to make your language more indirect and polite .
fzIxD1jXn44119,16.08,16.16,So for dealing with difficult question just remember the three d ’ s : delay deflect
,,,dismiss !
,,,Finally we want to ask you something .
fzIxD1jXn44120,16.19,16.28,Do you have any advice for giving good presentation in English or any language ?
,,,We ’ d love to hear your idea !
,,,Please leave a comment and tell u what you think .

UOceysteIjo1,0.13,0.16,Do you know any tip for a great presentation ? That ’ s the question someone asked me a few
,,,year ago and I said no . because It really didn ’ t matter to me a I my work never
UOceysteIjo2,0.16,0.22,involved giving presentation . Then one fine day I had to give a presentation to some
UOceysteIjo3,0.22,0.33,of my client although they were just a bunch of people I had never felt so nervous in
,,,my entire life . I spoke very fast without breathing because I just wanted to get over
UOceysteIjo4,0.33,0.39,with the presentation . Soon I realized it 's not gon na work like this my next presentation
UOceysteIjo5,0.39,0.46,ha to be great .
UOceysteIjo6,0.47,0.52,Now on the way to develop my own presentation skill I discovered many little hack that
,,,could improve the way we present thing to the audience maybe small or large . So in
UOceysteIjo7,0.52,1.03,this video today I am bringing you these little hack that would make a great amount
,,,of difference to your presentation skill . Hi I am AAKASH and today I am gon na share
UOceysteIjo8,1.03,1.14,with you few way to improve your presentation skill that have helped me personally or
,,,I could say they have saved me on a number of occasion . So let ’ s get started .
UOceysteIjo9,1.14,1.14,
UOceysteIjo10,1.25,1.36,Well I am not gon na start with your appearance how should you dress it common sense I
,,,am sure you all know that you need to be well dressed and appear great when you are supposed
,,,to stand on the podium . Of course you know that – you are not going to wear your most
UOceysteIjo11,1.36,1.41,comfortable boxer short and give a presentation . But I would like to add something here wear
UOceysteIjo12,1.41,1.47,something that you are comfortable in . Only because you saw some presenter wearing that
UOceysteIjo13,1.47,1.53,impressive Jacket you also shouldn ’ t jump in . How you carry what you wear is important .
UOceysteIjo14,1.53,1.53,
UOceysteIjo15,2,2,Okay now if I say that you need to be a genius with your presentation that would sound unrealistic .
UOceysteIjo16,2.05,2.05,But you need to know these 3 know even before you start preparing your presentation . These
UOceysteIjo17,2.05,2.11,3 Knows are definitely the building block for any great presentation .
UOceysteIjo18,2.16,2.16,First know know your room . Arrive early and stroll round so you know where you will
UOceysteIjo19,2.16,2.23,be presenting . You get the feel of the place we human always take some time to get adjusted
UOceysteIjo20,2.23,2.28,to the environment . Next know your people . Know your audience
UOceysteIjo21,2.28,2.28,
UOceysteIjo22,2.28,2.38,beforehand if you have a brief background about your audience you can tune your presentation
,,,accordingly . What ’ s the point of presenting something that in not in sync with your audience ?
UOceysteIjo23,2.38,2.45,Let me explain that to you better . In the software industry when you develop a particular
UOceysteIjo24,2.45,3.08,software understanding what the client need is very important understanding their business
,,,is very important if you don ’ t do that the outcome of the application what the client
,,,picturized would be completely different even though you are great at your programming
,,,skill . Same thing applies when it come to understanding your audience if you do your
UOceysteIjo25,3.08,3.19,homework well your presentation is sure to be accepted by the audience
,,,And finally know your speech well . Rehearse the presentation until you ’ re comfortable
UOceysteIjo26,3.19,3.25,with what you ’ re saying and how you ’ re saying it . After all you are presenting to
UOceysteIjo27,3.25,3.3,and for the audience . If you sound confused with your presentation and it ’ s not absorbed
UOceysteIjo28,3.3,3.35,by the audience what ’ s the point . So always remember these three know know your room
UOceysteIjo29,3.35,3.42,know your audience and know your speech well .
UOceysteIjo30,3.5,3.55,Take the comfort of knowing that nobody understands your presentation or the data in your presentation
,,,better than you . There is a very popular mantra shared by theatre expert that say Sometimes
UOceysteIjo31,3.55,4.01,mess can happen but ... “ The audience doesn ’ t know the script . ”
UOceysteIjo32,4.01,4.01,
UOceysteIjo33,4.01,4.06,So it could happen that you could mess with some of the point in your presentation .
UOceysteIjo34,4.11,4.16,You might forget to highlight some important fact what would you do ? Would you start saying
,,,sorry or maybe panic or freak ? Come on ... Just relax .
UOceysteIjo35,4.16,4.16,
UOceysteIjo36,4.22,4.28,Instead of freaking out freezing up or trying to ignore it happened just try to be graceful
,,,about it . Chances are that it went unnoticed by your audience . And even If it wa noticeable
UOceysteIjo37,4.28,4.28,
UOceysteIjo38,4.28,4.39,all you need to do is say “ excuse me ” “ I would like to add some more information ”
,,,and carry on with your presentation . Believe it or not presentation can be fun . All you
UOceysteIjo39,4.39,4.39,
UOceysteIjo40,4.39,4.45,need to do is be prepared and know your audience well ...
UOceysteIjo41,4.54,5.04,Are you one of those people who get really nervous and start to walk up and down the
,,,stage like a polar bear in a zoo mark a spot for yourself on the stage or bring a stool
,,,if required to use . Guy ’ s people are watching a presentation and not a tennis match ! I ’ m
UOceysteIjo42,5.04,5.1,really bad for shuffling while I ’ m talking . I even flap my hand around when I get excited
UOceysteIjo43,5.1,5.15,with some point in the presentation . Remember when you are presenting what do
UOceysteIjo44,5.15,5.21,you want your audience to remember your poor body language or your great presentation .
UOceysteIjo45,5.27,5.33,Do you want your audience to think about your message or your body movement ? So be aware
,,,of your body language .
UOceysteIjo46,5.34,5.4,Do you wriggle from one foot to the other crossing and uncrossing your leg or stepping
,,,backwards a lot ? Try to keep all these body movement under control . Make some eye contact .
UOceysteIjo47,5.4,5.4,
UOceysteIjo48,5.47,5.53,Eye contact help keeping the connection between your audience and you and is one of the key
,,,element for a great presentation . If you show your back all the time while reading
UOceysteIjo49,5.53,5.59,your slide that will destroy that bridge between the audience and you . Now also remember
UOceysteIjo50,5.59,6.05,staring down your audience without a blink can be creepy . It ’ s also stressful on you .
UOceysteIjo51,6.05,6.05,
UOceysteIjo52,6.11,6.11,Shift your gaze and sometimes it ’ s acceptable to glance at some note card if you have one .
UOceysteIjo53,6.17,6.23,But also remember just don ’ t read those card it 's gon na be a good a reading your
,,,slide . Come on you need to smile everyone know
UOceysteIjo54,6.23,6.27,you are nervous Giving presentation is nerve . So make sure you are smiling and make an effort
UOceysteIjo55,6.27,6.34,to make eye with people . Practice meeting your audience 's eye while rehearsing
UOceysteIjo56,6.34,6.4,and it ’ ll feel a lot more normal in the big presentation . This would project you a
UOceysteIjo57,6.4,6.45,a warm and friendly person and your audience would be also at ease .
UOceysteIjo58,6.55,7.02,Using PowerPoint ? Well you ’ re not the only one – Do you know ? There are around 350
,,,PowerPoint presentation given every second across the world . And what do you think are
UOceysteIjo59,7.02,7.07,they effective enough ? They aren ’ t that effective . Immediately after a ten minute
UOceysteIjo60,7.07,7.13,presentation only 50 % of the fact can be recalled . By the next day only 23 % is retained
UOceysteIjo61,7.13,7.19,and 7 day later just 10 % of the information . You know this human mind ha it own limit
UOceysteIjo62,7.19,7.26,and it can only hold on to between three and or say maximum seven point .
UOceysteIjo63,7.31,7.31,You should aim for three main point and your presentation would be remembered . ALSO AVOID
UOceysteIjo64,7.31,7.36,BIG WALLS OF TEXT . This is a common mistake a lot of presenter make with their PowerPoint
UOceysteIjo65,7.36,7.41,slide . I know it ’ s tempting to stick every item of information on your slide . However
UOceysteIjo66,7.41,7.41,
UOceysteIjo67,7.41,7.53,this will intimidate your audience and the recall value of your presentation would be
,,,limited . Now if you have too much text on your slide that would force you to turn your
UOceysteIjo68,7.53,7.59,back to the audience which is a big no in all form of public interaction . So guy
UOceysteIjo69,7.59,8.05,Keep your slide brief and let the audience keep the attention on you .
UOceysteIjo70,8.14,8.19,Rather than focusing your mind on your presentation and how you ’ re gon na do it think about
,,,the message that you are gon na give . You ’ ll come across a a lot more passionate and interested
UOceysteIjo71,8.19,8.25,and would give yourself an expert presenter status a well . You ’ ll also make fewer mistake
UOceysteIjo72,8.25,8.31,because you won ’ t be flustered . Define the purpose of your presentation . Before you start
UOceysteIjo73,8.31,8.31,
UOceysteIjo74,8.31,8.37,designing your presentation ask yourself what 's the purpose of your talk is . In general
UOceysteIjo75,8.37,8.43,you ’ re either informing persuading or building a goodwill .
UOceysteIjo76,8.47,9,So think about it : are you sharing your expertise giving a step workshop do you want
,,,people to buy your product or service are you motivating people educating them are
,,,you presenting case is it purely entertainment . Now these are just some main
UOceysteIjo77,9,9.06,theme you could build your talk or presentation around .
UOceysteIjo78,9.09,9.21,One of the best public speaking tip I have learned is to make sure that you ’ re only
,,,gon na cover 1 main topic and just stay away from adding anything else you might want to
,,,share . Although it might be important a well it just take away the power of your presentation .
UOceysteIjo79,9.21,9.21,
UOceysteIjo80,9.27,9.43,Now what do I mean by this For example This video is about How could you improve your
,,,presentation skill Well designing a good presentation is an important part of presentation
,,,skill However my main goal is to introduce you to important hack for delivering a good
,,,presentation and not how you could write a good presentation . I will certainly do that
UOceysteIjo81,9.43,9.49,in some other video . But In this video my main topic is How to deliver great presentation
UOceysteIjo82,9.49,9.56,And I am gon na just stick to that only that ’ s my main topic . Although I might share a few
UOceysteIjo83,9.56,10.01,highlight about designing a presentation but that ’ s not my main topic . You need to
UOceysteIjo84,10.01,10.07,draw an outline of your talk so you have a framework to start with . Because if you
UOceysteIjo85,10.07,10.13,don ’ t know the main purpose of your talk no in the audience will . So always define
UOceysteIjo86,10.13,10.19,the purpose of your presentation .
UOceysteIjo87,10.26,10.26,Hey ! Slow Down ... . Its not a RACE ... .
UOceysteIjo88,10.26,10.26,
UOceysteIjo89,10.28,10.45,Focusing on speaking slowly should be one of the most important thing in your talk
,,,because you are speaking for an audience where not everyone is an expert on the topic possibly
,,,quite a few people have English a their second or even third language and it really just
,,,take time for people to let new information sink in .
UOceysteIjo90,10.5,10.5,PRACTICE SPEAKING SLOWLY For some reason people talk faster onstage . I remember my
UOceysteIjo91,10.5,10.57,bos always told me to speak so slowly until the point it get uncomfortable . That will
UOceysteIjo92,10.57,11.04,be the perfect tempo for the audience . I promise it ’ s gon na feel weird initially .
UOceysteIjo93,11.04,11.04,
UOceysteIjo94,11.1,11.26,But what ’ s weirder : speaking a lot slower than usual or stumbling over your # word
,,,and confusing your listener ? There ’ s one more way you could learn to speak slower
,,,listen carefully to each and every word that you say only say the next word when you have
,,,listened to the first one clearly . It would help you to certainly slow down your speaking
UOceysteIjo95,11.26,11.31,speed and be clearer with your word and pronunciation .
UOceysteIjo96,11.4,11.47,Why do phrase like “ Once upon a time… ” or
,,,“ In a land far away… ” immediately grab our attention ? Because those phrase tell
,,,you you ’ re about to hear a story and story are incredible communication tool . When you
UOceysteIjo97,11.47,12,tell story in your presentation they challenge our intellect stimulate our imagination
,,,and touch our emotion . Why everyone doe love a good story ? Because story communicate
UOceysteIjo98,12,12.06,idea and information that no other medium can .
UOceysteIjo99,12.1,12.22,Now No matter where you tell a story it could be around a campfire when you are on a picnic
,,,it could be by the water cooler in the office or in a courtroom or even in an auditorium
,,,while giving presentation . The impact of a story always remains the same : When you
UOceysteIjo100,12.22,12.35,tell a story start strong be engaging capture the interest of your audience and get them
,,,thinking with an impactful story related to your presentation .
UOceysteIjo101,12.38,12.45,Look through for anywhere that you can add in story or a really good or relevant image
,,,from where you could build the stage for telling your story . Story telling will make your presentation
UOceysteIjo102,12.45,12.56,seem realistic a well a help your presentation to flow naturally and increase the retention
,,,of your presentation by a minimum 65 % . So learn the art of storytelling it certainly work .
UOceysteIjo103,12.56,12.56,
UOceysteIjo104,13.08,13.08,Listening to a presentation for any length of time can be a difficult process . If the
UOceysteIjo105,13.08,13.22,talk doesn ’ t engage their attention the audience will start to feel distanced from
,,,your presentation they will start to lose track of the flow of information and eventually
,,,fail to absorb your idea and insight . To engage an audience fully the presentation
UOceysteIjo106,13.22,13.35,need to be energetic purposeful and staged a if it is a direct conversation between
,,,you and the audience . Direct interaction with the audience is harder a most presentation
UOceysteIjo107,13.35,13.47,are one only but if you can find a way to get your audience to DO something like
,,,a activity chance are they will remember what you said much better .
UOceysteIjo108,13.52,13.57,The activity doesn ’ t have to take long but just let your audience member speak up
,,,or speak to each other for about a minute . To give an example I can recall a presentation
UOceysteIjo109,13.57,14.09,I attended where the speaker asked the audience to close their eye for a second and think
,,,about their first travel experience . And then to turn to the person sitting next and share
UOceysteIjo110,14.09,14.16,the travel experience . Very simple but so powerful a the rest of the presentation
UOceysteIjo111,14.16,14.22,wa all about powerful travel story .
UOceysteIjo112,14.26,14.26,Involving your audience is essential to making an impact . Your presentation should pull them
UOceysteIjo113,14.26,14.31,in get their attention and stimulate their thought and understanding . The way that you

bt8YFCveNpY1,0.02,0.05,"Okay, Laura, so what I d like to do now is"
,,,"just to do a short presentation, just a"
,,,"little soundbite, maybe 3040. Second, I"
bt8YFCveNpY2,0.05,0.12,think you going to do it about something
,,,relating to marketing it s all right
,,,"that s right Okay of you,"
,,,I work in search engine marketing. I make
bt8YFCveNpY3,0.12,0.56,sure that the website for the company
,,,go really high up in thing like
,,,"Google, because it s really important for"
,,,"the company to be seen by lot of people,"
,,,because then people will buy stuff it s
,,,really important and so I do thing like
,,,making sure there are lot of keywords
,,,on the page and making sure there s no
,,,"duplication between page, and there are"
,,,"lot of thing that you, can do and it s"
,,,really important and yeah that s that s
,,,it Okay Laura thanks very much for that
,,,that wa fantastic. So what I m gon na do
bt8YFCveNpY4,0.56,1,is give you a bit of feedback now and
,,,then I m going to ask in a moment just
,,,to do it again with some improvement.
bt8YFCveNpY5,1.02,1.03,First thing to say is: I think the
,,,content wa fantastic. If you saw that
bt8YFCveNpY6,1.03,1.06,written down it would sound tremendous.
bt8YFCveNpY7,1.08,1.1,You said all the right thing but I
,,,think made me there s some way in the
,,,delivery. We could get that across a
bt8YFCveNpY8,1.11,1.13,little bit more. You just look a little
bt8YFCveNpY9,1.13,1.18,bit kind of uncomfortable a If you
,,,do nt really care about what you re
,,,talking about. So I think perhaps just a
bt8YFCveNpY10,1.18,1.2,you look at the cam would just be a bit
,,,more. excited about it and just imagine
bt8YFCveNpY11,1.21,1.26,"that you, re not just trying to get some"
,,,"information across, but You re trying to"
,,,get five people s. imagination when you
bt8YFCveNpY12,1.26,1.34,do it so just look into the into the
,,,audience and just project it a little
,,,"bit more. let the hand come up, so I"
bt8YFCveNpY13,1.34,1.41,"think it s a much a mindset thing, a a"
,,,body thing you once you start to do that
,,,I think you ll find it so much more.
bt8YFCveNpY14,1.42,1.44,engaging so do nt change the content but
,,,it s the delivery. that need to be
bt8YFCveNpY15,1.44,1.44,"improved. Do whatever guy that sure Okay,"
bt8YFCveNpY16,1.46,1.54,imagine life without search engine a
,,,few year ago. They would nt even have
bt8YFCveNpY17,1.54,2.06,existed and We did nt know what They
,,,"were, but now They re an essential tool"
,,,for all consumer to find what They re
,,,Looking for that s why it s really
,,,really vital for all company to invest
,,,in search engine marketing. and search
bt8YFCveNpY18,2.06,2.08,engine optimization.
bt8YFCveNpY19,2.1,2.18,There are a few key tip for how you can
,,,make sure that your website is really
,,,high up in the search engine and that
,,,"you, re therefore found by anybody that s"
,,,"want to buy your product. For example,"
bt8YFCveNpY20,2.18,2.27,you need to make sure that the relevant
,,,keywords are really high on the page
,,,This mean that the search engine can
,,,find the relevant page. for the person
bt8YFCveNpY21,2.27,2.38,that s Looking you also need to make
,,,"sure that your content is fresh, that"
,,,it s renewed regularly and that there
,,,is nt duplicated between several page.
bt8YFCveNpY22,2.4,2.42,Those are just a few tip to get You
,,,started law that wa great.
bt8YFCveNpY23,2.44,2.57,You really projected your personality
,,,that one thing We talked about is the
,,,audience will tend to feel what you feel
,,,So you re kind of an emotion in charge
,,,of their emotional state and They re you
,,,projected positive energy and that s
,,,what a you look at the audience you can
,,,"see how they were, responding. Unto you"
bt8YFCveNpY24,2.57,2.58,and a lot of other thing happens. Your
bt8YFCveNpY25,2.58,3,hand came out. You had a smile on your
bt8YFCveNpY26,3,3.06,face and even the content changed which
,,,it often doe when you re doing that
,,,"you, re So much more. positive you are"
bt8YFCveNpY27,3.06,3.11,"selling the benefit, so it s just that"
,,,one small change about how you feel
,,,about what it is you re talking about.
bt8YFCveNpY28,3.13,3.18,make a very big difference to the
,,,"impact that you, can have and the"
,,,influence you ll have over your audience
,,,I thought that wa absolutely fantastic.

HRaPmO6TlaM16,3.23,3.4,The French Revolution of 1789 and The
,,,Bolshevik Revolution were both
,,,significantly by certain ideal.
HRaPmO6TlaM17,3.43,3.43,question of The extent to which the
,,,ideal. involved became implemented is of
HRaPmO6TlaM18,3.44,3.57,great importance because the answer
,,,a great deal about the nature of The
,,,Revolution involved So we all got that
,,,"Oh alrights. Next, one is want to help."
HRaPmO6TlaM19,3.57,3.57,

,,,in the French Revolution they had.
HRaPmO6TlaM25,5.04,5.26,guy right called the

,,,"successful good afternoon, lady"

,,,"area of transformational leadership,"
,,,my presentation is divided into
,,,part. We first of all define
HRaPmO6TlaM39,8.1,8.5,"and define transformational leadership,"
,,,A well one of The most
,,,feature of any talk is the
,,,Prisca ha clearly outlined her
,,,point and her talk conveys a sense
,,,"direction, one and pas it behind"
,,,"enough For everybody, but all at all"
,,,"defines leadership, A the ability"
,,,influence others to
,,,organizational
,,,Priska ha researched her
,,,thoroughly and given source for her
,,,They say that transformational
,,,are those leader who seek to change
,,,status quo. They Priscus manner
HRaPmO6TlaM40,8.5,9,delivery is appropriate for an
,,,presentation She us formal
,,,and her slide are suitable
,,,"reference and bright color, but no,"
,,,gimmick. The slide are easy to read and
HRaPmO6TlaM41,9.02,9.05,do not contain too much information
,,,seen. A A role model is respected and is
HRaPmO6TlaM42,9.08,9.11,trusted by follower. The second
HRaPmO6TlaM43,9.11,9.16,obviously enjoys her subject and
,,,to keep the audience s.
HRaPmO6TlaM44,9.18,9.2,throughout the talk She s
,,,attention and treat
,,,individually. He mentor he coach
HRaPmO6TlaM45,9.23,9.4,and he advises them a well it is
,,,"that transformational leader, are"
,,,Taker Priska engages her audience by
,,,"delivering her material, a a talk not"
,,,just reading word from a
,,,of paper or from the screen. She
HRaPmO6TlaM46,9.4,9.53,good use of her note written on
,,,card so that they prompt her to talk
,,,but
,,,do nt cover her face or distract
,,,audience with whom she maintains
,,,eye contact. There inspire? U of
HRaPmO6TlaM47,9.53,10.07,"and they also trust, they are"
,,,"organization, and they all Priscus"
,,,"material, is related to her topic and She"
,,,make it relevant to The audience too by
,,,referring to real situation.
HRaPmO6TlaM48,10.09,10.19,all that ha resulted in two high
,,,"morale, improved service delivery and of"
,,,"course, a satisfied, client, and we are"
,,,happy now to be known. A the
HRaPmO6TlaM49,10.19,10.23,Prisca ha been in control
,,,her presentation. Now She is practiced
HRaPmO6TlaM50,10.23,10.29,that the torque keep the time and She
,,,know how to use the computer
,,,effectively. She know her subject well.
HRaPmO6TlaM51,10.3,10.3,
HRaPmO6TlaM52,10.33,10.37,"and ha researched It carefully, so that"
,,,She is Now confident to answer the
,,,audience s. question and suggest
HRaPmO6TlaM53,10.37,10.39,"source of information. and lastly, I d"
HRaPmO6TlaM54,10.39,10.53,just like to leave you with this
,,,from Henry Kissinger that say that the
,,,"task of The leader, is to get his"
,,,from where They are to where They have
,,,"not been now, If there s any of you who s."
HRaPmO6TlaM55,10.56,11,"interested in pursuing this, all These"

,,,successful presentation. which ha
HRaPmO6TlaM56,11,11.24,followed a clear pattern and kept

,,,Priska is prepared and that ha made
,,,the
,,,well we ve had. a very interesting
HRaPmO6TlaM57,11.24,11.24,here. Looking at These presentation and
HRaPmO6TlaM58,11.26,11.31,I think There are some very important

HRaPmO6TlaM59,11.31,11.43,need to understand your topic and be
,,,prepared to answer question on it then

,,,presentation that s going to
,,,thing like The structure. and
HRaPmO6TlaM60,11.43,11.57,emphasizing
,,,organization signal to make the
,,,point clear you need to make that
,,,You do nt just read your presentation
,,,either from the slide or from a handout
,,,"but actually use,"
,,,"card, which You re number"
,,,you drop them. You also need to make sure
HRaPmO6TlaM61,11.57,12.03,that You re familiar
,,,Do nt turn up and to

XyRjKCT_wrk1,0,0.11,"When it come to presenting online, most"
,,,"of what we see is pretty, in fact, if"
,,,you re invited to watch an online
,,,presentation or attend an online virtual
,,,"meeting, your expectation are pretty low."
XyRjKCT_wrk2,0.14,0.2,"Well, these are five top tip to make"
,,,sure you deliver awesome content that
,,,everybody will remember now it s worth
,,,"saying. I m, assuming in this video that"
XyRjKCT_wrk3,0.23,0.27,you re going to be either filming on
,,,your phone or on your laptop. A most
XyRjKCT_wrk4,0.27,0.38,people would be tip number one think
,,,about the setting that you are in So
,,,when you re delivering an online
,,,presentation really think about your
,,,background. What s behind you! you! do nt
XyRjKCT_wrk5,0.41,0.52,"want anything that s too distracting, so"
,,,not in the kitchen with all the kitchen
,,,crap behind you! you! want something
,,,"that s plain and that look professional,"
,,,"just use a backdrop like I m, using now."
XyRjKCT_wrk6,0.55,1,This is just a standard black backdrop
,,,and you can buy these on Amazon and
,,,they re really not that expensive. The
XyRjKCT_wrk7,1,1,same. You can get a stand to hold your
XyRjKCT_wrk8,1.02,1.07,"backdrop on A well, so I d really"
,,,consider investing in one of those. If
XyRjKCT_wrk9,1.07,1.18,you re going to be doing more online
,,,presentation think about how quiet the
,,,area is that you re presenting in So you
,,,do nt want any background. Noise close
XyRjKCT_wrk10,1.18,1.3,"the window, make it A quiet a possible"
,,,"because when you re presenting online,"
,,,the sound is really important and think
,,,"about the lighting a well, so you. want"
XyRjKCT_wrk11,1.3,1.35,the space that you re in to be really
,,,"well, lit, so turn the light on. If"
XyRjKCT_wrk12,1.35,1.48,"there s A window, in the room that you re"
,,,in make sure that that is in front of
,,,you and basically that no lighting
,,,source is directly behind you! because
,,,what you ll find is it will look like
,,,you re in darkness to the viewer. So
XyRjKCT_wrk13,1.48,1.54,really think about the setting that
,,,you re in number two stand up. If you
XyRjKCT_wrk14,1.54,1.57,stand up. you will naturally deliver A
XyRjKCT_wrk15,1.57,2,much better presentation. You will look
XyRjKCT_wrk16,2,2.08,like you are performing far too often
,,,when we sit and we watch an online
,,,presentation we re watching. Somebody sat
XyRjKCT_wrk17,2.08,2.13,at the table slunt down
,,,it s hard to present. From this point of
XyRjKCT_wrk18,2.13,2.18,"view, it look like they do nt care it s"
,,,hard to retain somebody s attention. When
XyRjKCT_wrk19,2.18,2.21,you look like that So stand up. and
XyRjKCT_wrk20,2.21,2.35,"really give it A presentation, style, it"
,,,will shock the audience into listening
,,,because most of what they see in online
,,,presentation is crap and it will make
,,,them listen
,,,so deliver A performance by standing up.
XyRjKCT_wrk21,2.37,2.37,"Now, if you re going to stand up. you need"
XyRjKCT_wrk22,2.37,2.4,to raise your laptop. up. higher so that
XyRjKCT_wrk23,2.4,2.43,the lens of the camera is in your direct
,,,eyeline. You do not want to be looking
XyRjKCT_wrk24,2.46,2.55,"down at your camera lens, because then"
,,,all your audience can see is the inside
,,,"of your nose. Cavity, so standing up. will"
XyRjKCT_wrk25,2.55,2.55,
XyRjKCT_wrk26,2.55,2.58,just naturally make you deliver A better
,,,presentation. and that is key. When
XyRjKCT_wrk27,3.01,3.01,
XyRjKCT_wrk28,3.01,3.06,"delivering a presentation, online you are"
,,,still performing so stand up. and perform
XyRjKCT_wrk29,3.06,3.1,tip number three rehearse. You need to
XyRjKCT_wrk30,3.1,3.3,treat your online presentation A you
,,,"would a presentation, on A stage in front"
,,,"of 200 people So practice get set up, get"
,,,"the camera set up, and practice"
,,,"performing to that camera lens, tip"
,,,number four dress: to impress. How often
XyRjKCT_wrk31,3.3,3.38,"do we watch people presenting online, and"
,,,it look like they ve made? No effort at
,,,all you. need to treat your online
XyRjKCT_wrk32,3.38,3.41,presentation in the same. way. You Would a
XyRjKCT_wrk33,3.41,3.46,performance in front of 200 people So
,,,"dress: to impress. if it s casual,"
XyRjKCT_wrk34,3.46,3.53,something where you re maybe just
,,,"talking to colleague something casual,"
,,,"like This Would work. But maybe, if you re"
XyRjKCT_wrk35,3.53,4.21,"presenting to customer, you need to"
,,,dress: smarter something like This The
,,,important thing to remember with online
,,,presentation is you need to treat it A
,,,"you would a presentation, in front of A"
,,,live audience so when it come to what
,,,to wear
,,,my advice is mirror the audience if
,,,you re presenting to colleague then you
,,,"can go with casual, But if you re"
,,,"presenting to customer, I d always go"
,,,with smart think about What you! Would be
,,,wearing. If you were on
XyRjKCT_wrk36,4.23,4.39,and number five think about your
,,,supporting material by supporting
,,,material
,,,"I mean PowerPoint Prezi, whatever slide"
,,,format you intend to use But also video
,,,"A well, do nt ignore video. You can still"
XyRjKCT_wrk37,4.39,4.45,start an online presentation with an
,,,opening video. If you want to and The
XyRjKCT_wrk38,4.45,5.14,slide that you use make sure you use
,,,picture so that people really remember
,,,them and remember you and your content
,,,and importantly with supporting content
,,,you need to make sure that you have a
,,,"backup a well, when thing are online"
,,,you always run the risk of the stream
,,,going down and people not being able to
,,,see you If this happens have your
,,,supporting content your slide and your
,,,"opening video. available, so that you can"
XyRjKCT_wrk39,5.14,5.19,send it to people If they have nt been
,,,"able to see it Properly online, So those."
XyRjKCT_wrk40,5.22,5.27,are my five top tip when it come to
,,,"presenting online, remember the"
,,,audience s expectation is low. most of
XyRjKCT_wrk41,5.27,5.45,these are So If you just put in
,,,some extra effort and follow those five
,,,top tip you ll deliver some awesome
,,,content that people will remember thanks
,,,for watching that video I hope you found
,,,it useful if you did here s the link to

5utoLhjUuAI1,0.08,0.08,"Hi, my name is Joe McCarthy. I m one of"
5utoLhjUuAI2,0.08,0.19,the pad shooter at the University of
,,,"Bedfordshire, and I m going to give you a"
,,,very brief introduction of what
,,,paraphrasing is so by the end of today s
,,,"session, you ll know about why we use"
,,,reference. The difference between quote
5utoLhjUuAI3,0.21,0.32,and paraphrasing and how to paraphrase
,,,"so, there are three main reason why it s"
,,,important to reference. in your
5utoLhjUuAI4,0.32,0.32,assignment.
5utoLhjUuAI5,0.35,0.37,"First of all, reference can help to"
,,,validate your point of view. So if you re
5utoLhjUuAI6,0.37,0.45,making a claim or an argument about
,,,"anything in particular, it s always"
,,,important to use evidence to make that a
,,,"stronger argument. Okay, the next reason"
5utoLhjUuAI7,0.45,0.49,is plagiarism. It s very easy to
5utoLhjUuAI8,0.49,0.51,accidentally plagiarize in your work. So
5utoLhjUuAI9,0.51,0.54,if you understand how to reference.
5utoLhjUuAI10,0.56,0.59,"correctly, you ll avoid plagiarizing the"
,,,last thing it s a source of future
,,,"investigation. So, for example, if anyone"
5utoLhjUuAI11,1.01,1.05,read your work. and they re interested
5utoLhjUuAI12,1.05,1.1,to find out more about what this person
,,,"ha said, they can go away and they can"
,,,locate that information. They can locate
5utoLhjUuAI13,1.1,1.38,"that source So, there s two way future"
,,,reference in quoting and
,,,paraphrasing
,,,a quotation is when you copy a piece of
,,,text word from a book or
,,,another type of source you should keep
,,,these to an absolute minimum at
,,,University we re looking to see that
,,,you re paraphrasing rather than just
,,,copying lengthy text from somebody
,,,"else. S work, so a I just mentioned, do"
5utoLhjUuAI14,1.4,1.48,not have them too long that will eat
,,,into your word count and ultimately it
,,,"will affect the mark that you ll get. So,"
5utoLhjUuAI15,1.48,1.53,paraphrasing is what we re looking to
,,,see that you re doing your assignment.
5utoLhjUuAI16,1.54,1.56,"However, anything is when you look at"
,,,"other people, s work. and you put it into"
5utoLhjUuAI17,1.56,1.58,your own word. It wa more to
5utoLhjUuAI18,1.58,2.06,paraphrasing than just changing one or
,,,two word here and there or cutting out
,,,word from a sentence. It will show your
5utoLhjUuAI19,2.06,2.18,"understanding to the reader, so, instead"
,,,of just identifying that something s
,,,important and copying it word
,,,You ve been able to read it understand
,,,it and apply it to your work. So I m
5utoLhjUuAI20,2.18,2.35,"going to show you an example, of how to"
,,,go from using a quote to paraphrasing it
,,,So if We look at this quote here in
,,,"academic writing, it s essential to state"
,,,the source of idea information. Such
5utoLhjUuAI21,2.35,2.39,reference allow reader to refer back
,,,to the source themselves. This next
5utoLhjUuAI22,2.39,2.46,slide show you my First attempt of
,,,paraphrasing the original is at the
,,,bottom. My first attempt at the top
5utoLhjUuAI23,2.49,3,"Cottrell state that in writing, it s"
,,,important to state the source of idea
,,,reference allow reader to find the
,,,source themselves. Okay. What do you
5utoLhjUuAI24,3,3.11,think about my First attempt of
,,,paraphrasing
,,,you have nt quoted it properly it s not
,,,a very good attempt. You re right. I
5utoLhjUuAI25,3.11,3.11,
5utoLhjUuAI26,3.11,3.15,have nt done it properly I ve cut out
,,,some word here and there I ve used some
,,,synonym. I ve changed essential to
5utoLhjUuAI27,3.17,3.3,important it s not actually enough to do
,,,this and call it paraphrasing at the top
,,,you ll see my next attempt the original
,,,at the bottom. and my First attempt is in
5utoLhjUuAI28,3.3,3.3,view. here contrl state that referencing
5utoLhjUuAI29,3.32,3.41,should always be used when using the
,,,idea and opinion of others and
,,,"academic writing, so that the original"
,,,source can be easily located. What do you
5utoLhjUuAI30,3.41,3.57,think of this attempt yeah that s much
,,,better and you properly reference the
,,,"page, a well okay? So this is a much"
,,,better attempt at paraphrasing I m not
,,,"going to claim it perfect, but you can"
,,,see that I certainly have tried to put
,,,it into my own word. and I ve still got
5utoLhjUuAI31,3.57,4.02,the same point across and I ve correctly
,,,referenced the author.
5utoLhjUuAI32,4.08,4.11,So once you paraphrase once you ve put
,,,something into your own word. how do you
5utoLhjUuAI33,4.11,4.16,include that in your text well you need
,,,to make sure you put the surname of the
,,,author. or the organization and you need
5utoLhjUuAI34,4.17,4.21,to put the year of publication. So that
5utoLhjUuAI35,4.21,4.26,will look like this at the start of a
,,,sentence. Cottrell 2001 stated that
5utoLhjUuAI36,4.28,4.28,plagiarism. is a confusing and difficult
5utoLhjUuAI37,4.32,4.34,concept to fully understand. So you can
5utoLhjUuAI38,4.34,4.37,see at the beginning of the sentence. the
5utoLhjUuAI39,4.37,4.37,"author. s, surname go first and the date"
5utoLhjUuAI40,4.39,4.41,of publication. come next. You would use
5utoLhjUuAI41,4.41,4.41,
5utoLhjUuAI42,4.41,4.44,a reference. at the beginning of the
5utoLhjUuAI43,4.44,4.44,sentence. if you re planning on talking
5utoLhjUuAI44,4.45,4.47,about this person s idea further. For
5utoLhjUuAI45,4.47,4.5,"example, my next sentence. say this"
5utoLhjUuAI46,4.5,4.5,author. also found that you can see here
5utoLhjUuAI47,4.52,5,I ve referred back to Cottrell and it s
,,,obvious that I m continuing to talk
,,,about this person at the end of a
,,,sentence. It would look like this
5utoLhjUuAI48,5.03,5.08,plagiarism is a confusing and difficult
,,,concept to fully understand. Cottrell
5utoLhjUuAI49,5.08,5.1,2001 if you use a reference. at the end
5utoLhjUuAI50,5.1,5.14,of the sentence. It implies that you re
5utoLhjUuAI51,5.14,5.17,only talking about this last sentence.
5utoLhjUuAI52,5.19,5.28,paragraph and it s come from Cottrell it
,,,doe nt make that clear putting it at
,,,the end of the sentence. implies you re
5utoLhjUuAI53,5.28,5.3,only talking about this very last
,,,sentence. Okay. that s very important and
5utoLhjUuAI54,5.31,5.46,that s how accidental plagiarism can
,,,take place
,,,"so to conclude, referencing correctly can"
,,,really strengthen your assignment. and
5utoLhjUuAI55,5.46,5.47,help you to do very well in your course.
5utoLhjUuAI56,5.5,5.52,When you paraphrase you should write
,,,"down what the author. ha said, completely"
5utoLhjUuAI57,5.52,5.54,in your own word.
5utoLhjUuAI58,5.56,6.13,Remember it s not enough just to change
,,,one or two word here and there
,,,"Finally, you must give credit to the"
,,,person whose idea you re using when you
,,,paraphrase and to do this you must
,,,"reference it correctly, if you re not"
,,,"sure how to do that correctly, you can"
,,,have a look at your faculty
,,,available on the LR web. This is what
5utoLhjUuAI59,6.13,6.2,your reference would look like in a
,,,"reference. list, but we ll be talking"
5utoLhjUuAI60,6.22,6.23,about that next time. Doe. Anyone
5utoLhjUuAI61,6.23,6.29,"any question. Ok. Well, thank you very"
5utoLhjUuAI62,6.29,6.33,much For listening. I hope it wa
5utoLhjUuAI63,6.33,6.34,much For listening. I hope it wa
,,,and I ll see you again
Jv18JGOk06o1,0.09,0.15,"Hello, i m jennifer whitt director of"
,,,"projectmanager.com,"
,,,"well welcome, today s whiteboard session"
,,,on how to deliver a presentation. What
Jv18JGOk06o2,0.15,0.21,I ve learned is one of the most
,,,frightening thing for most project
,,,manager is giving a presentation. but
Jv18JGOk06o3,0.21,0.4,that s where we can influence our our
,,,"team influence our stakeholder, our"
,,,"executive, get their buy, sell an idea"
,,,"it s the most powerful thing we can do,"
,,,But it s the most frightening but there
,,,are a few simple step that I m going to
,,,cover today on delivering a great
,,,presentation.
Jv18JGOk06o4,0.43,0.47,So presentation are like any other
,,,"thing that we have to do, a project"
,,,manager or any professional. It take
Jv18JGOk06o5,0.47,0.47,practice. So It s something that instead
Jv18JGOk06o6,0.5,1.08,of raising the bar and expecting to walk
,,,out on a on in front of your audience or
,,,your team or any group that you re
,,,"presenting to it s about practice,"
,,,"practice, practice, practice, So here are"
,,,"some few thing to get you going, there"
,,,are three component of a presentation.
Jv18JGOk06o7,1.1,1.21,"there s actually the presentation, the"
,,,"preparation for the presentation, there"
,,,"is the presentation, itself and there s"
,,,"follow after the presentation, suppose"
,,,break it down. So preparation is what do
Jv18JGOk06o8,1.21,1.29,"I do, before? I give them a proper"
,,,"presentation, So there s a lot of thing"
,,,"to do, here a few category one is"
,,,expectation. What is the expectation.
Jv18JGOk06o9,1.32,1.32,
Jv18JGOk06o10,1.35,1.39,for your audience or for whoever s
,,,bringing you in if you are giving a
,,,"presentation. to your executive, your"
Jv18JGOk06o11,1.41,1.49,"stakeholder, maybe a client, your project"
,,,team number one define your audience but
,,,also talk with them and get. clear
Jv18JGOk06o12,1.49,1.49,"expectation. I ve got an s o W here,"
Jv18JGOk06o13,1.51,2.04,"because in the work that I do, I get a"
,,,statement of work It s actually a
,,,documented signed off statement of work
,,,so that both party know and agree to
,,,and understand the expectation. of that
Jv18JGOk06o14,2.04,2.04,presentation. So It s important to
Jv18JGOk06o15,2.07,3.41,understand what is the topic? What are
,,,"you going, to be presenting? Is it a"
,,,status report? Is it a keynote? Is it
,,,information to a team are you rolling
,,,out
,,,new project? Are you launching a new
,,,product line? What is it that is going to
,,,be the topic? of your presentation and
,,,knowing the audience who s going to be
,,,"there? Are you going, to be presenting? to"
,,,"executive, your stakeholder, your"
,,,project team is it going to be different
,,,"business unit, or is there going to be"
,,,internal external people there? Is it
,,,going to be a mix of people who Are at
,,,different level different experience?
,,,What is the location? Where will this
,,,presentation be Is it going to be in
,,,your office? Is it in the city? Is it in
,,,the country? Is it out of the country?
,,,What is the venue? Is it going to be a
,,,conference hall? Is it going to be a
,,,conference room it s going to be an
,,,office? Where Is What is the venue? for
,,,"the presentation, and time? How long will"
,,,you have? Will you have? a 20 minute
,,,presentation? Is this a one hour keynote?
,,,Is it 90 minute you have? a half an hour
,,,just you need to know what time? How much
,,,time you have? and what takeaway are the
,,,"client, or the people bringing you in"
,,,"expecting? What are you going, to leave"
,,,behind so that they can follow up?
,,,Understand read upon after your
,,,"presentation after you re gone, the"
,,,second part is once you have? a clear
,,,"expectation. of What you re going, to be"
Jv18JGOk06o16,3.43,3.48,presenting? it s researching researching
,,,through I love. Google. Google. is one of
Jv18JGOk06o17,3.48,3.52,my best friend when I m researching
,,,thing it s So easy to go. Google a topic?
Jv18JGOk06o18,3.52,3.54,I can also go. to a library. I can also
Jv18JGOk06o19,3.54,3.54,
Jv18JGOk06o20,3.54,3.59,"interview people, one powerful thing for"
,,,company. Your project team is to
Jv18JGOk06o21,4.02,4.18,interview the people who Are going to be
,,,in the audience interview the people who
,,,"Are bringing you in for the presentation,"
,,,"and the reason you want to do, that is"
,,,"you want to find out what are the issue,"
,,,what s bothering them? What are you there
,,,"to really address, and once you start"
,,,talking to people you get. different
Jv18JGOk06o22,4.18,4.35,"perspective, different perspective, of"
,,,how people see the common issue and what
,,,"you can do, to actually address, some of"
,,,those issue and through that you want
,,,to remain relevant relevancy to your
,,,audience
,,,you want to be talking about thing that
,,,matter
,,,to them It s timely. If you re in
Jv18JGOk06o23,4.35,4.52,"technology, you do nt want to be talking"
,,,"about technology, that s really old it s"
,,,not applicable to them if you re doing
,,,"green project, some nonprofit project"
,,,"construction engineering, whatever you re"
,,,doing you want to stay relevant to What
,,,they care about. So you will also want to
Jv18JGOk06o24,4.52,4.54,keep in the back of your mind. Why do
Jv18JGOk06o25,4.54,5.26,they care Why are they bringing you in
,,,and Why are they going to listen to you
,,,about this topic and what doe this mean
,,,to them you know people are always
,,,"coming in for presentation, you want to"
,,,"keep them? engaged, keep them? excited and"
,,,tuned in to What you re saying during
,,,your presentation So It s important to
,,,know have? them? be thinking all the time?
,,,"what doe this mean to me, and How can I"
,,,take this back and use it? Professional
,,,"material, so whether you re delivering a"
,,,"PowerPoint, you re actually giving"
,,,"handout or presentation material, and"
,,,hardcopy. You want them? to remain
Jv18JGOk06o26,5.29,5.38,"Professional If you re going, to be"
,,,"presenting? something online, it s"
,,,important to know How to get in make
,,,sure you can have access. Make sure that
Jv18JGOk06o27,5.38,5.51,you have? the logins and password and
,,,they re still active and valid and then
,,,takeaway making sure that your
,,,takeaway are already that you know
,,,Where to ship them to and what s
,,,actually needed. So that s a lot of
Jv18JGOk06o28,5.51,6.05,preparation before? you even begin
,,,those are only a few of many
,,,"thing, but just an idea of where to"
,,,start then I feel like there s some best
,,,"practice before? at the presentation,"
,,,before? the day of it s important to
,,,visit the venue? actually go. to the
Jv18JGOk06o29,6.05,6.08,where you re having the meeting. If it s
Jv18JGOk06o30,6.08,6.11,in your office? building just go. make
Jv18JGOk06o31,6.11,6.13,sure they have enough seating. The
Jv18JGOk06o32,6.13,6.49,are arranged how you like It the
,,,"and feel If it s a conference area,"
,,,"it s a stadium, if It s on location?"
,,,location? visiting that before? so you
,,,have? an idea and you have? a feel of What
,,,"it feel like for you How are you going,"
,,,to project How many people are going to
,,,be there? so you know what equipment
,,,might need also a rest and relax
,,,This is one of the most frightening
,,,"thing that most project manager do, and"
,,,even professional speaker always still
,,,get those butterfly in their
,,,before? they speak. So It s important to
Jv18JGOk06o33,6.49,6.5,"get a good night s. Rest, not"
Jv18JGOk06o34,6.5,6.5,about. your presentation How thing are

,,,also equipment making sure you have?
,,,"backup, I always have backup, I do, nt"
,,,leave myself held hostage to
,,,"else getting equipment, getting"
,,,having control over what I ve got to
,,,"step into, because what I ve learned is"
,,,you do nt really know If you do that you
,,,do nt really know you may expect them to
,,,"have a laptop or LCD or material, there"
,,,and you show up and whoever s
,,,to have that done Maybe they re off or
,,,"they do nt really care So I do, nt leave"
,,,"that I do, nt leave myself open to those"
,,,"pitfall and then snack, depending"
,,,how long this Is If you re there for a
,,,longer period of time? Maybe
,,,multiple speaking event maybe you re one
,,,"of the later speaker, is having snack,"
,,,"water thing to hydrate,"
,,,"then the day of the presentation, again."
Jv18JGOk06o37,7.51,7.51,"This is during the presentation, again."
Jv18JGOk06o38,7.54,7.54,This is a study so for people who go. in
Jv18JGOk06o39,7.54,8.12,to begin speaking this Is a study
,,,one of these are like you know there? Are
,,,"so many thing, that you can about"
,,,each one of these so number one
,,,"arrive, to the venue? set up and"
,,,"early, so actually going on the day"
,,,"of you get. there early, you make sure"
Jv18JGOk06o40,8.12,8.17,"that the environment there I do, nt know"
,,,How many time. I ve shown up and the
Jv18JGOk06o41,8.17,8.21,power s out equipment did nt show up
,,,critical resource. Did nt show up So
Jv18JGOk06o42,8.21,8.25,"It s good to get there early, so you make"
,,,"sure everything s. Okay, these are some of"
Jv18JGOk06o43,8.25,8.28,"the there are a lot of area, for."
Jv18JGOk06o44,8.3,8.46,"failure here, so you want to keep on"
,,,of it set up and test equipment
,,,make sure your laptop your
,,,"PowerPoint, presentation, work If you re"
,,,"doing something online, you have?"
,,,"recept reception, so get there early,"
,,,"because that light that way,"
,,,"time you give yourself, time If"
,,,"something go. awry to have a backup,"
Jv18JGOk06o45,8.46,8.55,"number to the presentation,"
,,,this one right here is a study in itself
,,,"when you become a, if you go. into,"
Jv18JGOk06o46,8.55,9.21,"presentation this Is an area, of study"
,,,where you can
,,,of time? working with
,,,"class to learn this this skill,"
,,,"the presentation, there are three part"
,,,there s the intro there s the
,,,that you re delivering and the So
,,,the intro is coming out with
,,,either a question or a quote
,,,statistic: some hook that get your
,,,audience listening to you when you speak.
Jv18JGOk06o47,9.24,9.33,then there s the message having a clear
,,,"concise, pointed message that people can"
,,,follow if you re rambling all over the
,,,"place and people ca, nt Follow you"
,,,they re gon na leave and
,,,frustrated. So you want to have a clear
Jv18JGOk06o48,9.35,9.44,"concise, message and then the outro,"
,,,"are you going, to wrap it up? so you"
,,,basically tell the audience what you re
,,,"going, to tell them. you tell them."
Jv18JGOk06o49,9.44,9.44,
Jv18JGOk06o50,9.46,9.46,your message and then you tell them.
Jv18JGOk06o51,9.48,10.26,"so you introduce it, you say it and then"
,,,you wrap it up? and then through their to
,,,"the delivery, is remembering a few"
,,,"that is like what is your tone,"
,,,"you there to do, are you there to"
,,,a team are you there to someone
,,,are you there to deliver
,,,So It s remembering why you re there and
,,,"what tone, do? you need to set do you need"
,,,to be upbeat? Do you need to be
,,,"do you need to interject humor, or do you"
,,,need to respect the fact that you re
,,,"going, to have to deliver bad news, and"
,,,"then the pace, understanding the pace,"
,,,"you may have practiced, and you may know."
Jv18JGOk06o52,10.28,10.3,"what you re going, to say so you all have"
,,,It down. but remembering that your
Jv18JGOk06o53,10.3,10.36,audience have? never heard
,,,"before So keeping a pace, that people can"
,,,follow and giving them the pause.
Jv18JGOk06o54,10.39,11.24,can actually sink in and listen to and
,,,hear what you re saying and then
,,,"question knowing How when you re going,"
,,,to ask question So you need to know
,,,"going in are you going, to leave yourself,"
,,,"room to ask question are you going, to"
,,,"take question during the presentation,"
,,,"are you going, to take question"
,,,"the presentation, and one powerful thing"
,,,we ve learned is you do nt want to leave
,,,your presentation with a powerful
,,,message sending people up? to know
,,,exactly what you want and then
,,,some someone to disrupt your whole
,,,presentation by
,,,asking some question that s going to
,,,throw either the audience off are you
,,,"off so you want to leave yourself, room"
,,,If you do ask question at the to
,,,"leave yourself, time to go. back and"
Jv18JGOk06o55,11.24,11.27,the message that you left
,,,with. You also want to have them know
Jv18JGOk06o56,11.3,11.4,what are the step
,,,what are the next step? that they are
,,,that they re supposed to take give them
,,,a call to action? Are they do they need
,,,to go. complete a survey? Do they need to
Jv18JGOk06o57,11.4,11.42,take a course? Do they need to go.
Jv18JGOk06o58,11.43,11.43,complete Some deliverable
,,,brochure. Do they need to come
Jv18JGOk06o59,11.46,12.19,the next class? What is it that you need
,,,"them? to do, and always always always give"
,,,them their cut your information
,,,How can they reach you for
,,,question can they email you?
,,,call you do they fill out a form?
,,,they do to reach you for
,,,information we found some of the best
,,,practice is when when you re at the
,,,"presentation, and at the end,"
,,,"card from people, If they have card"
,,,their card so you have? their contact
,,,"information? make little note,"
,,,"done, someone s card and if they ask a"
,,,"question I ll write a note, on the back"
,,,hey. They ask this question and I need to
Jv18JGOk06o60,12.21,12.25,"send some follow or if they want me,"
,,,to send them a book or some resource. I
Jv18JGOk06o61,12.25,12.4,"write the note, on the back of their card"
,,,Then I ll write down any question that
,,,people ask that I need to take back and
,,,maybe I follow up? to one person
,,,would nt Follow up? to the group and then
,,,"I also take any other note, that maybe I"
,,,need to go. back and Adjust
Jv18JGOk06o62,12.4,12.5,"presentation or follow up? some note, to"
,,,"myself of something I need to do, and"
,,,then there s the follow So this Is
,,,"What happens after the presentation,"
,,,again. it s more study about this but
Jv18JGOk06o63,12.53,13.01,"here are a few thing that I like to do,"
,,,is send a thank and depending
,,,what s appropriate for your audience
,,,again. depending on who they are and what
Jv18JGOk06o64,13.02,13.09,"It is that you had the presentation, on I"
,,,like to send a little thank thank
,,,you for attending my session.
Jv18JGOk06o65,13.11,13.13,for attending this presentation or this
,,,course? here are the thing that we we
,,,said. You asked this question and I found
Jv18JGOk06o66,13.16,13.18,it wa very interesting. Thank you for
Jv18JGOk06o67,13.18,14.03,"participating, or you can do, that through"
,,,"email or a note, card and if you ve"
,,,committed to send any other
,,,takeaway
,,,then send those promptly
,,,question again if It s or
,,,group do you answer
,,,timely and promptly and send it to
,,,either the individual or the group
,,,whoever you committed to follow up? on
,,,"next step? so if you left people,"
,,,with your audience with next step? Then
,,,follow up? on the next step? maybe after
,,,"a day or So or a week, follow up? and say"
,,,"how, s it going I know you were"
,,,read this article or take this course? or
,,,take the survey? How Is it going I like
,,,to hear more and then you the
,,,next step? so after these step? are
,,,"completed, it s always taking them."
Jv18JGOk06o68,14.05,14.1,through next step? and if there? Are
,,,other further next step? Then it
,,,out So close it out formally.

TmbQFWBvTtY1,0,0,When we stand and present we want to come across a confident and composed .
TmbQFWBvTtY2,0.04,0.04,And one of the great way to do that is by working on our body language . Let 's
TmbQFWBvTtY3,0.04,0.08,look at three way to improve your nonverbal body language in presentation .
TmbQFWBvTtY4,0.12,0.12,Coming up .
TmbQFWBvTtY5,0.19,0.19,Hello again friend . If you never seen one of my video I 'm Alex Lyon .
TmbQFWBvTtY6,0.19,0.19,
TmbQFWBvTtY7,0.22,0.25,And this channel Communication Coach is here to help you increase
,,,your impact so you can lead your team to higher level of excellence . And I
TmbQFWBvTtY8,0.25,0.29,believe that presentation skill are a really important part of leadership .
TmbQFWBvTtY9,0.33,0.35,You 're going to be standing and presenting quite frequently if you 're in
,,,any kind of leadership position . So we want to get just a little bit better at
TmbQFWBvTtY10,0.35,0.39,this . Let 's look at three way you can improve your nonverbal body language so
TmbQFWBvTtY11,0.39,0.43,that people can hear your message in a much more confident and composed way .
TmbQFWBvTtY12,0.47,0.47,And these tip by the way go together . So each of the three tip have a couple of
TmbQFWBvTtY13,0.47,0.51,piece a you 'll see . So the first tip is eye contact and smile . So eye contact .
TmbQFWBvTtY14,0.51,0.51,
TmbQFWBvTtY15,0.51,0.51,
TmbQFWBvTtY16,0.57,1.01,You have to look directly into somebody 's eye that 's listening about
,,,99 % of the time . You do n't want to look too much at your note . You do n't want to
TmbQFWBvTtY17,1.01,1.01,
TmbQFWBvTtY18,1.01,1.05,look back at your slide really . You certainly do n't want to look at the
TmbQFWBvTtY19,1.05,1.08,floor over their head . A lot of bad habit out there in term of eye contact .
TmbQFWBvTtY20,1.08,1.08,
TmbQFWBvTtY21,1.13,1.16,You want to look directly in someone 's eye almost the whole time and that
,,,really take quite a bit of practice . The other thing you want to do is look
TmbQFWBvTtY22,1.16,1.23,directly into somebody 's eye long enough to finish a thought and then move
,,,on to the next person . So you do n't want to just stare at one person the whole
TmbQFWBvTtY23,1.23,1.26,time and you do n't want to scan so that you 're never locking in . A communication
TmbQFWBvTtY24,1.26,1.32,coach actually once told me  One thought one look . '' So long enough to finish about
TmbQFWBvTtY25,1.32,1.36,a sentence feel that connection and then you move on to the next person . So what
TmbQFWBvTtY26,1.36,1.41,do you do with your face while you 're making eye contact . You 've got to
TmbQFWBvTtY27,1.41,1.45,smile . A lot of time people get overly robotic when they present . They might be
TmbQFWBvTtY28,1.45,1.45,
TmbQFWBvTtY29,1.45,1.49,making good eye contact but their face is stern . And it doe n't look like
TmbQFWBvTtY30,1.49,1.53,anything 's happening emotionally . You want to smile and warm your face up a
TmbQFWBvTtY31,1.53,2.02,little bit so that when you 're making eye contact with somebody they feel a
,,,connection with you that 's welcoming and supportive . You do n't want to come across
TmbQFWBvTtY32,2.02,2.05,a a deer in the headlight . Tip number two . Posture and gesture . And these
TmbQFWBvTtY33,2.05,2.05,
TmbQFWBvTtY34,2.05,2.05,
TmbQFWBvTtY35,2.05,2.1,thing go together . So in term of what not to do for posture you do n't
TmbQFWBvTtY36,2.1,2.14,want to shuffle your foot back and forth . You do n't want to sway your hip . You
TmbQFWBvTtY37,2.14,2.14,
TmbQFWBvTtY38,2.14,2.19,do n't want to cross and uncross your leg repetitively . You do n't want to pace
TmbQFWBvTtY39,2.19,2.23,around like a wild person . By the way if you want to walk in a presentation it 's
TmbQFWBvTtY40,2.23,2.31,okay to walk a little bit but make sure when you walk you stop and you say a
,,,little bit before you walk again . So walk with a purpose
TmbQFWBvTtY41,2.31,2.34,stop share your message and then maybe a minute or so later walk again . Do n't pace .
TmbQFWBvTtY42,2.34,2.34,
TmbQFWBvTtY43,2.39,2.43,So once you have these don'ts out of the way what should you do ? You want to stand
,,,with your foot about shoulder width apart . This is how you would stand if you
TmbQFWBvTtY44,2.43,2.48,were n't self about how you 're standing . We get self when we
TmbQFWBvTtY45,2.48,2.51,present but really all you have to do is stand like a normal person . Then you want
TmbQFWBvTtY46,2.51,2.59,to put just a tiny bit of weight on the front of your foot and a little tiny bit
,,,lighter on your heel . And your whole foot is still touching but you have a
TmbQFWBvTtY47,2.59,3.04,little bit more of a ready responsive position . You also want to soften your
TmbQFWBvTtY48,3.04,3.08,knee a little bit . You do n't want to have locked knee . Bad thing happen when
TmbQFWBvTtY49,3.08,3.08,
TmbQFWBvTtY50,3.08,3.12,your lock your knee . I 'm not sure of the physiology of it but when people lock
TmbQFWBvTtY51,3.12,3.16,their knee they oftentimes pas out when they 're nervous . And you do n't want
TmbQFWBvTtY52,3.16,3.2,to do that in the middle of your presentation . So soften those knee . Now
TmbQFWBvTtY53,3.2,3.2,
TmbQFWBvTtY54,3.2,3.24,you 've got your posture . Let 's add some gesture to it . You do n't want to put
TmbQFWBvTtY55,3.24,3.24,
TmbQFWBvTtY56,3.24,3.28,your hand in your pocket . You do n't want to put your hand behind your back .
TmbQFWBvTtY57,3.28,3.28,
TmbQFWBvTtY58,3.3,3.3,You do n't want to grab on to different part of your body for security . All that
TmbQFWBvTtY59,3.3,3.34,look very distracting . So here 's what you should do . You should loosely clasp
TmbQFWBvTtY60,3.34,3.34,
TmbQFWBvTtY61,3.34,3.39,your hand at about belt level . And then you should just gesture naturally from
TmbQFWBvTtY62,3.39,3.44,there . You do n't want to interlock your finger you do n't want to wring your
TmbQFWBvTtY63,3.44,3.47,hand . Because then you 'll get too locked in and it 's hard to let go . But if you
TmbQFWBvTtY64,3.47,3.47,
TmbQFWBvTtY65,3.47,3.54,practice at home just loosely clasping your hand like this then just start to
,,,gesture naturally from here and that 's the way to do it . Small little gesture
TmbQFWBvTtY66,3.54,3.58,just like this . You can do this all day long and it 's just going to add a nice
TmbQFWBvTtY67,3.58,4.02,emphasis to your word and it 's not going to be distracting whatsoever .
TmbQFWBvTtY68,4.06,4.06,Tip number three . You want to pause . And when you pause after a key idea add a little
TmbQFWBvTtY69,4.06,4.06,
TmbQFWBvTtY70,4.06,4.11,tiny bit of a nod . I 've seen some really convincing and persuasive speaker do
TmbQFWBvTtY71,4.11,4.16,this . And what you 'll notice if you pause after a key idea and nod that pause is
TmbQFWBvTtY72,4.16,4.21,really persuasive but the nodding is contagious . You 'll see that people
TmbQFWBvTtY73,4.21,4.24,listening to you actually start to nod a little bit with you . And
TmbQFWBvTtY74,4.24,4.27,that 's one of the way that you know you have them . It 's a very subtle but
TmbQFWBvTtY75,4.27,4.31,powerful nonverbal body language tip . So those are my three tip for improving
TmbQFWBvTtY76,4.31,4.35,your nonverbal body language when you 're presenting . But I 'd like to hear your
TmbQFWBvTtY77,4.35,4.39,tip . Question of the day how do you recommend that we improve our body
TmbQFWBvTtY78,4.39,4.43,language while we 're presenting . Please put the comment below in that section . I
TmbQFWBvTtY79,4.43,4.43,
TmbQFWBvTtY80,4.43,4.47,look forward to reading those . So thanks . God bless . I 'll see you in the next video .

,,,but we also in other place I will talk about presentation .
x9E8yaFCX0Y7,0.3,0.3,In fact Iím going to link you to an article on presentation right down there .
x9E8yaFCX0Y8,0.34,0.34,Okay so letís get to what are my 5 tip so that you can deliver an awesome presentation .
x9E8yaFCX0Y9,0.4,0.4,One you need to practice .
x9E8yaFCX0Y10,0.43,0.43,Number two you need to keep the audience keep the listener engaged .
x9E8yaFCX0Y11,0.48,0.48,Number three you need to keep it simple and sweet .
x9E8yaFCX0Y12,0.52,0.52,Number four properly use visuals and number five you need to bring it .
x9E8yaFCX0Y13,0.57,0.57,Okay so letís talk about practice .
x9E8yaFCX0Y14,0.59,0.59,You hear this all the time .
x9E8yaFCX0Y15,1,1,Iím not bringing anything new but really no one can wing it .
x9E8yaFCX0Y16,1.05,1.14,Of course you know there are people like Tony Robins who get off a airplane he go right
,,,to the stage but heís thinking about what heís going to cover and heís practiced hundred
,,,if not probably thousand of time .
x9E8yaFCX0Y17,1.18,1.22,If youíre new to speaking in front of an audience and most of u are most of u donít
,,,get in front of arenít professional speaker .
x9E8yaFCX0Y18,1.25,1.36,You need to practice and you need to practice a lot especially if you donít know what or
,,,you havenít done this for a long time because if you lock up in front of an audience itís
,,,different .
x9E8yaFCX0Y19,1.37,1.4,In front of the camera I can go over there and I can restart this and in fact this video
,,,Iíve probably restarted 4 time .
x9E8yaFCX0Y20,1.42,1.42,But at the end of the day I control it .
x9E8yaFCX0Y21,1.45,1.45,With an audience you donít .
x9E8yaFCX0Y22,1.46,1.46,You donít want to lock up so let me give you an example .
x9E8yaFCX0Y23,1.51,1.56,When I wa interviewing in business school I went to this really high end consulting
,,,company and they brought me into a hotel and I wa sitting there with the consultant .
x9E8yaFCX0Y24,1.59,2.08,We were having a nice conversation and all of a sudden he turn on the interview and
,,,he start asking me very difficult business question which I didnít even know half of
,,,the stuff that heís talking about .
x9E8yaFCX0Y25,2.13,2.13,I wasnít prepared for it and it just caught me and I froze up .
x9E8yaFCX0Y26,2.17,2.21,Now the reason I told you that story is actually Iím leading this to part two so weíve talked
,,,about preparation .
x9E8yaFCX0Y27,2.22,2.22,Now itís grabbing attention .
x9E8yaFCX0Y28,2.24,2.3,Do you notice how when I told you that story about the consulting interview you immediately
,,,probably tuned a bit more into this video .
x9E8yaFCX0Y29,2.32,2.32,Thatís because I grabbed your attention .
x9E8yaFCX0Y30,2.33,2.37,I shared with you an experience which is true by the way but itís one that you can
,,,relate to because youíve locked up .
x9E8yaFCX0Y31,2.39,2.44,Youíve had instance in which having somebody talk to you in a language that youíre just
,,,totally lost on .
x9E8yaFCX0Y32,2.45,2.45,So donít be afraid to find a way to bring the audience in .
x9E8yaFCX0Y33,2.49,2.54,One of the best way is a story and youíre going to need to do this every 10 to 15 minute
,,,because you canít just give people ton of information .
x9E8yaFCX0Y34,2.57,3.02,You can give them information for a few minute but after 10 to 15 minute you need to bring
,,,them back with a story or bring them back with a visual .
x9E8yaFCX0Y35,3.06,3.15,Step away from the information and really youíre addressing a different part of the
,,,brain and you need to wake people up because your information may be great may be beautiful
,,,but youíre going to put them to sleep .
x9E8yaFCX0Y36,3.18,3.18,So letís talk about number three .
x9E8yaFCX0Y37,3.19,3.19,Keep it simple and sweet .
x9E8yaFCX0Y38,3.21,3.21,Youtubeís great about this .
x9E8yaFCX0Y39,3.22,3.22,Youíll notice most of the video on Youtube are like 3 to 5 minute long .
x9E8yaFCX0Y40,3.27,3.4,Beyond that you want to keep it simple and sweet so if youíve got a longer presentation
,,,donít say that itís busting 35 going up to 60 minute really look at do you need
,,,to use that full 60 minute ?
,,,Just because they give you 60 minute doe not mean you have to use the full 60 minute .
x9E8yaFCX0Y41,3.45,3.45,Okay now letís talk about visuals .
x9E8yaFCX0Y42,3.48,3.48,PowerPoint is overused .
x9E8yaFCX0Y43,3.5,3.55,I remember when PowerPoint first came out and it wa like ìWow ! î Thatís really cool
,,,and before that we were all using the overhead and projector .
x9E8yaFCX0Y44,3.59,3.59,PowerPoint is awesome but it is so overused .
x9E8yaFCX0Y45,4.02,4.02,You donít have to use PowerPoint .
x9E8yaFCX0Y46,4.05,4.05,Your visuals need to serve you .
x9E8yaFCX0Y47,4.08,4.08,You donít want to serve your visuals so never just read off of PowerPoint .
x9E8yaFCX0Y48,4.13,4.13,If youíre going to use PowerPoint use it to get the main point across .
x9E8yaFCX0Y49,4.18,4.18,You never want to redirect them from the slide .
x9E8yaFCX0Y50,4.2,4.25,Look over to your PowerPoint maybe pull one of two note from it but somebody should not
,,,be able to read your PowerPoint and know exactly what the presentation wa about .
x9E8yaFCX0Y51,4.29,4.34,So make sure again that you control your visuals and that your visuals do not control
,,,you .
x9E8yaFCX0Y52,4.35,4.35,Finally bring it and the whole thing here is make sure you bring your A game .
x9E8yaFCX0Y53,4.39,4.46,Be excited because youíre not passionate about what youíre talking about if youíre
,,,not excited why should your audience be ?
,,,Okay this ha been Antonio Centeno with Real Men Real Style .
x9E8yaFCX0Y54,4.49,4.49,Hope you enjoy this video and Iíll see you in the next one .
x9E8yaFCX0Y55,4.52,4.52,Bye .
FOCpMAww281,0.12,0.15,Some people think that there 's a TED Talk formula :
,,,Give a talk on a round red rug .
FOCpMAww282,0.17,0.17,Share a childhood story .
FOCpMAww283,0.18,0.18,Divulge a personal secret .
FOCpMAww284,0.2,0.2,End with an inspiring call to action .
FOCpMAww285,0.23,0.23,No .
FOCpMAww286,0.24,0.24,That 's not how to think of a TED Talk .
FOCpMAww287,0.26,0.28,In fact if you overuse those device
,,,you 're just going to come across a clichéd or emotionally manipulative .
FOCpMAww288,0.32,0.42,But there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common
,,,and I would like to share that thing with you
,,,because over the past 12 year I 've had a ringside seat
,,,listening to many hundred of amazing TED speaker like these .
FOCpMAww289,0.46,0.5,I 've helped them prepare their talk for prime time
,,,and learned directly from them
,,,their secret of what make for a great talk .
FOCpMAww2810,0.53,0.57,And even though these speaker and their topic all seem
,,,completely different
,,,they actually do have one key common ingredient .
FOCpMAww2811,1.01,1.1,And it 's this :
,,,Your number one task a a speaker
,,,is to transfer into your listener ' mind an extraordinary gift
,,,a strange and beautiful object that we call an idea .
FOCpMAww2812,1.16,1.16,Let me show you what I mean .
FOCpMAww2813,1.17,1.17,Here 's Haley .
FOCpMAww2814,1.18,1.2,She is about to give a TED Talk
,,,and frankly she 's terrified .
FOCpMAww2815,1.22,1.4,Presenter : Haley Van Dyck !
,,,Over the course of 18 minute
,,,1200 people many of whom have never seen each other before
,,,are finding that their brain are starting to sync with Haley 's brain
,,,and with each other .
FOCpMAww2816,1.41,1.41,They 're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain pattern .
FOCpMAww2817,1.45,1.45,And I do n't just mean they 're feeling the same emotion .
FOCpMAww2818,1.48,1.48,There 's something even more startling happening .
FOCpMAww2819,1.5,1.5,Let 's take a look inside Haley 's brain for a moment .
FOCpMAww2820,1.54,1.54,There are billion of interconnected neuron in an impossible tangle .
FOCpMAww2821,1.58,2.03,But look here right here
,,,a few million of them are linked to each other
,,,in a way which represents a single idea .
FOCpMAww2822,2.06,2.1,And incredibly this exact pattern is being recreated in real time
,,,inside the mind of everyone listening .
FOCpMAww2823,2.13,2.21,That 's right ; in just a few minute
,,,a pattern involving million of neuron
,,,is being teleported into 1200 mind
,,,just by people listening to a voice and watching a face .
FOCpMAww2824,2.24,2.31,But wait what is an idea anyway ?
,,,Well you can think of it a a pattern of information
,,,that help you understand and navigate the world .
FOCpMAww2825,2.34,2.38,Ideas come in all shape and size
,,,from the complex and analytical
,,,to the simple and aesthetic .
FOCpMAww2826,2.4,2.4,Here are just a few example shared from the TED stage .
FOCpMAww2827,2.43,2.43,Sir Ken Robinson creativity is key to our kid ' future .
FOCpMAww2828,2.47,2.53,Sir Ken Robinson : My contention is that creativity now
,,,is a important in education a literacy
,,,and we should treat it with the same status .
FOCpMAww2829,2.56,2.56,Chris Anderson : Elora Hardy building from bamboo is beautiful .
FOCpMAww2830,2.59,3.01,Elora Hardy : It is growing all around u
,,,it 's strong it 's elegant it 's earthquake .
FOCpMAww2831,3.05,3.05,CA : Chimamanda Adichie people are more than a single identity .
FOCpMAww2832,3.09,3.17,Chimamanda Adichie : The single story creates stereotype
,,,and the problem with stereotype is not that they are untrue
,,,but that they are incomplete .
FOCpMAww2833,3.19,3.21,CA : Your mind is teeming with idea
,,,and not just randomly .
FOCpMAww2834,3.23,3.23,They 're carefully linked together .
FOCpMAww2835,3.25,3.28,Collectively they form an amazingly complex structure
,,,that is your personal worldview .
FOCpMAww2836,3.3,3.3,It 's your brain 's operating system .
FOCpMAww2837,3.32,3.32,It 's how you navigate the world .
FOCpMAww2838,3.34,3.34,And it is built up out of million of individual idea .
FOCpMAww2839,3.38,3.47,So for example if one little component of your worldview
,,,is the idea that kitten are adorable
,,,then when you see this
,,,you 'll react like this .
FOCpMAww2840,3.48,3.54,But if another component of your worldview
,,,is the idea that leopard are dangerous
,,,then when you see this
,,,you 'll react a little bit differently .
FOCpMAww2841,3.57,3.59,So it 's pretty obvious
,,,why the idea that make up your worldview are crucial .
FOCpMAww2842,4.03,4.06,You need them to be a reliable a possible a guide
,,,to the scary but wonderful real world out there .
FOCpMAww2843,4.09,4.09,Now different people 's worldviews can be dramatically different .
FOCpMAww2844,4.14,4.35,For example
,,,how doe your worldview react when you see this image :
,,,Dalia Mogahed : What do you think when you look at me ?
,,,A woman of faith an expert maybe even a sister ?
,,,Or oppressed brainwashed
,,,a terrorist ?
,,,CA : Whatever your answer
,,,there are million of people out there who would react very differently .
FOCpMAww2845,4.38,4.38,So that 's why idea really matter .
FOCpMAww2846,4.4,4.46,If communicated properly they 're capable of changing forever
,,,how someone think about the world
,,,and shaping their action both now and well into the future .
FOCpMAww2847,4.51,4.51,Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture .
FOCpMAww2848,4.55,5.04,So if you accept
,,,that your number one task a a speaker is to build an idea
,,,inside the mind of your audience
,,,here are four guideline for how you should go about that task :
,,,One limit your talk to just one major idea .
FOCpMAww2849,5.09,5.17,Ideas are complex thing ;
,,,you need to slash back your content so that you can focus
,,,on the single idea you 're most passionate about
,,,and give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly .
FOCpMAww2850,5.2,5.2,You have to give context share example make it vivid .
FOCpMAww2851,5.24,5.29,So pick one idea
,,,and make it the through running through your entire talk
,,,so that everything you say link back to it in some way .
FOCpMAww2852,5.33,5.33,Two give your listener a reason to care .
FOCpMAww2853,5.37,5.41,Before you can start building thing inside the mind of your audience
,,,you have to get their permission to welcome you in .
FOCpMAww2854,5.44,5.46,And the main tool to achieve that ?
,,,Curiosity .
FOCpMAww2855,5.47,5.47,Stir your audience 's curiosity .
FOCpMAww2856,5.49,5.52,Use intriguing provocative question
,,,to identify why something doe n't make sense and need explaining .
FOCpMAww2857,5.56,6,If you can reveal a disconnection in someone 's worldview
,,,they 'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap .
FOCpMAww2858,6.04,6.06,And once you 've sparked that desire
,,,it will be so much easier to start building your idea .
FOCpMAww2859,6.1,6.13,Three build your idea piece by piece
,,,out of concept that your audience already understands .
FOCpMAww2860,6.17,6.23,You use the power of language
,,,to weave together concept that already exist
,,,in your listener ' mind
,,,but not your language their language .
FOCpMAww2861,6.25,6.25,You start where they are .
FOCpMAww2862,6.27,6.3,The speaker often forget that many of the term and concept they live with
,,,are completely unfamiliar to their audience .
FOCpMAww2863,6.33,6.42,Now metaphor can play a crucial role in showing how the piece fit together
,,,because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern
,,,based on an idea that the listener already understands .
FOCpMAww2864,6.46,6.54,For example when Jennifer Kahn
,,,wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR
,,,she said It 's a if for the first time
,,,you had a word processor to edit DNA .
FOCpMAww2865,6.57,6.57,CRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily .
FOCpMAww2866,7.02,7.06,Now a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment
,,,a it snap into place in our mind .
FOCpMAww2867,7.08,7.12,It 's important therefore to test your talk on trusted friend
,,,and find out which part they get confused by .
FOCpMAww2868,7.15,7.17,Four here 's the final tip :
,,,Make your idea worth sharing .
FOCpMAww2869,7.21,7.26,By that I mean ask yourself the question :
,,,Who doe this idea benefit ?
,,,And I need you to be honest with the answer .
FOCpMAww2870,7.29,7.32,If the idea only serf you or your organization
,,,then I 'm sorry to say it 's probably not worth sharing .
FOCpMAww2871,7.35,7.35,The audience will see right through you .
FOCpMAww2872,7.37,7.51,But if you believe that the idea ha the potential
,,,to brighten up someone else 's day
,,,or change someone else 's perspective for the better
,,,or inspire someone to do something differently
,,,then you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk
,,,one that can be a gift to them and to all of u .
i5mYphUoOCs1,0,0.02,In this video I 'll share public speaking tip
,,,for beginner .
i5mYphUoOCs2,0.04,0.07,So if you 're just getting started
,,,in your stand speaking experience
,,,this video is for you .
i5mYphUoOCs3,0.08,0.08,So let 's unpack the detail .
i5mYphUoOCs4,0.15,0.17,Hello there and welcome to this channel
,,,Communication Coach .
i5mYphUoOCs5,0.18,0.25,If you 've never tuned in yet
,,,this channel is here to help rising leader
,,,increase your personal impact
,,,so you can lead the people around you
,,,with more excellence .
i5mYphUoOCs6,0.27,0.29,And today we 're talking about communication skill
,,,specifically .
i5mYphUoOCs7,0.3,0.36,If you have n't had a lot of experience
,,,doing stand speaking
,,,I 'm going to give you some do and some don'ts
,,,that 'll help move you in the right direction .
i5mYphUoOCs8,0.38,0.45,And a we talk about these do and don'ts
,,,I want you to pick out which one you think
,,,would help you the most and feel free at any point
,,,to comment in that section below the video .
i5mYphUoOCs9,0.48,0.52,So when I said do 's and don'ts
,,,we 're actually going to start with the don'ts
,,,and then give you the do version of it
,,,so that 's the way we 'll organize it .
i5mYphUoOCs10,0.54,0.54,So the first pair go like this .
i5mYphUoOCs11,0.56,0.56,Do n't ramble and get long .
i5mYphUoOCs12,1,1.09,Anytime a speaker is disorganized
,,,and weave all around
,,,it 's very hard to follow what he or she
,,,is talking about and instead what you want to do
,,,is give a nice organized and concise message .
i5mYphUoOCs13,1.13,1.24,That mean you have to take the time beforehand
,,,when you 're preparing to create a nice introduction
,,,body and conclusion
,,,make sure you have clear main point
,,,and there 's a transition statement
,,,between each main point .
i5mYphUoOCs14,1.25,1.35,Your audience is really going to appreciate
,,,an orderly presentation of your idea
,,,and it 's much more likely that they 'll remember
,,,what you said and really that 's the whole point
,,,of speaking to them in the first place .
i5mYphUoOCs15,1.37,1.4,The next do n't is do n't look with your eye
,,,in the wrong place .
i5mYphUoOCs16,1.42,1.48,You want to not look over people 's head
,,,or not look at the floor
,,,and not stare at the ceiling
,,,or scan around like that .
i5mYphUoOCs17,1.5,2,What you want to do is look directly
,,,into a person 's eye long enough to finish a thought
,,,and then move on and look directly
,,,into the next person 's eye
,,,long enough to finish a thought .
i5mYphUoOCs18,2.02,2.04,One public speaking teacher told me
,,,one thought one look .
i5mYphUoOCs19,2.06,2.08,In other word about a sentence or a half a sentence
,,,and then move on to the next person .
i5mYphUoOCs20,2.11,2.12,Now this is very difficult to do
,,,if you 're not used to it .
i5mYphUoOCs21,2.13,2.18,It can feel very awkward looking right into someone 's eye
,,,but you have to gear up for this
,,,because that 's what audience want .
i5mYphUoOCs22,2.2,2.2,We want people to connect with this .
i5mYphUoOCs23,2.22,2.26,If you 're not looking into our eye
,,,and making u feel like we 're part of this
,,,then you 're not going to have much of an impact .
i5mYphUoOCs24,2.29,2.36,The next thing you want to do is do n't
,,,rather this is a do n't
,,,do n't clutter up all your note
,,,with too many detail .
i5mYphUoOCs25,2.38,2.4,A lot of time we 're tempted to jam our note
,,,or our powerpoints with everything we want to say .
i5mYphUoOCs26,2.43,2.53,But the result is when we 're nervous in the moment
,,,we end up just locked in to our note
,,,and looking down the whole time and reading
,,,and sounding really stiff really wooden
,,,and you 're not going to again connect with people .
i5mYphUoOCs27,2.55,3.02,So what you want to do instead
,,,is pare down your note
,,,so that you can just have a conversational style
,,,with your audience .
i5mYphUoOCs28,3.03,3.11,And again a you 're practicing
,,,you have to whittle down those note
,,,so that all you have is like talking point
,,,like a little grocery list of item
,,,that you 're going to talk about .
i5mYphUoOCs29,3.12,3.21,And it almost force you or at least free you
,,,to connect with people to look up
,,,and to have a nice normal conversation with them
,,,in your natural personality .
i5mYphUoOCs30,3.24,3.28,The next do n't is you do n't want to load up your slide
,,,with all complicated animation and text .
i5mYphUoOCs31,3.32,3.34,And one of the reason is you do n't want
,,,to stare at it and read from it .
i5mYphUoOCs32,3.35,3.4,The other reason is that it 's very hard to follow
,,,what 's going on if your slide
,,,are jam with the detail .
i5mYphUoOCs33,3.42,3.49,What you want to do instead is to make sure
,,,your slide are nice and clear
,,,and simple and help you make whatever point
,,,you 're making in that particular moment .
i5mYphUoOCs34,3.51,4.09,A rule of thumb that I like to use
,,,is if you 're spending more than about two or three minute
,,,on each PowerPoint slide
,,,then you 're probably wasting your time
,,,and I do n't recommend using more than a couple of slide
,,,for a presentation anyway if you 're a beginner
,,,because people tend to over rely on the slide
,,,and load up each single slide with way too much .
i5mYphUoOCs35,4.12,4.12,The next do n't is do n't fidget .
i5mYphUoOCs36,4.15,4.15,Do n't fidget with your hand .
i5mYphUoOCs37,4.16,4.16,Do n't fidget with your foot .
i5mYphUoOCs38,4.18,4.21,Do n't pace back and forth aimlessly
,,,because you 're nervous .
i5mYphUoOCs39,4.22,4.34,What you want to do instead is have nice confident posture
,,,where you stand in one place for a little while
,,,and then if you want to move with a purpose move
,,,stand in another place for a while
,,,and then share another part of your message .
i5mYphUoOCs40,4.36,4.38,Move for the purpose stand still
,,,share some of your message .
i5mYphUoOCs41,4.39,4.4,Do n't just pace
,,,have nice confident posture .
i5mYphUoOCs42,4.42,4.42,Same thing with your hand .
i5mYphUoOCs43,4.43,4.45,You want to use gesture
,,,and emphasize your idea with your hand .
i5mYphUoOCs44,4.48,4.53,You do n't want to fidget and put them in your pocket
,,,or play with a pen or do anything else weird
,,,or distracting like that .
i5mYphUoOCs45,4.54,4.59,That 's a big part of how you come across non
,,,and I recommend to you when you 're practicing
,,,you work on this a well .
i5mYphUoOCs46,5.01,5.01,And the last do n't undo is how you use your voice .
i5mYphUoOCs47,5.04,5.07,What you do n't want to do is speak too softly
,,,use a lot of filler like um and ah and so .
i5mYphUoOCs48,5.11,5.16,What you want to do is have a confident voice
,,,where you speak loud like to the back of the room
,,,with a nice clear volume .
i5mYphUoOCs49,5.18,5.2,Aim for the back of the room because just think about it
,,,you have to reach those people .
i5mYphUoOCs50,5.22,5.28,The other thing you want to do is emphasize
,,,your key word with the sound of your voice
,,,and also pause after you share a key idea
,,,or a key thought .
i5mYphUoOCs51,5.3,5.3,Pause for a minute silently .
i5mYphUoOCs52,5.31,5.33,Do n't fill it up with an um or an oh
,,,the pause is much more effective .
i5mYphUoOCs53,5.35,5.37,So here are some do and don'ts
,,,some tip for beginner .
i5mYphUoOCs54,5.39,5.46,Again a I mentioned
,,,where do you see yourself in here ?
,,,Which one you think would help you the most
,,,in this list ?
,,,I would love to hear your comment
,,,in that section below .
i5mYphUoOCs55,5.48,5.49,So thanks God bless
,,,and I will see you in the next video .
TQiln3CjtvM1,0,0.02,A lot of work go into creating
,,,well PowerPoint slide .
TQiln3CjtvM2,0.05,0.1,Unfortunately many of the million of slide
,,,that are created every day
,,,are n't engaging the audience at all .
TQiln3CjtvM3,0.12,0.12,In fact many are hard to read and understand .
TQiln3CjtvM4,0.15,0.21,But there are a few really important
,,,and easy to implement tip that can really make a difference
,,,in your slide design .
TQiln3CjtvM5,0.23,0.23,Let 's check them out .
TQiln3CjtvM6,0.3,0.32,Before we get started a brief thanks to Skillshare
,,,for sponsoring today 's video .
TQiln3CjtvM7,0.34,0.36,Skillshare is a learning platform
,,,with lot of great class .
TQiln3CjtvM8,0.38,0.4,I have a special link for you that give you two month
,,,free premium access .
TQiln3CjtvM9,0.42,0.45,You 're going to find it in the description of this video
,,,and I 'll be chatting more about them towards the end .
TQiln3CjtvM10,0.48,0.48,Now let 's get started with my slide design tip .
TQiln3CjtvM11,0.52,0.52,Number one visualize your data .
TQiln3CjtvM12,0.55,0.55,Presenting number and data can be a challenge .
TQiln3CjtvM13,0.58,0.58,For one it 's probably not the most exciting topic .
TQiln3CjtvM14,1.01,1.08,And second if you put a lot of data on your slide
,,,the audience is going to be busy reading the slide
,,,instead of paying attention to you .
TQiln3CjtvM15,1.1,1.17,Here 's an example a slide like this
,,,encourages the audience to read and try to make sense
,,,of the data .
TQiln3CjtvM16,1.18,1.21,Their attention is going to be on the slide
,,,not on what you 're saying .
TQiln3CjtvM17,1.23,1.23,Instead you could present it like this .
TQiln3CjtvM18,1.27,1.29,Already from the title of the slide
,,,the audience can get the critical information .
TQiln3CjtvM19,1.31,1.34,The supporting chart make it easier
,,,to interpret the slide .
TQiln3CjtvM20,1.36,1.42,The important thing here is that you guide the eye
,,,to the most important topic and avoid distraction
,,,on the slide .
TQiln3CjtvM21,1.43,1.43,Which brings me to my next tip .
TQiln3CjtvM22,1.46,1.46,Number two use white space and do n't clutter .
TQiln3CjtvM23,1.5,1.54,White or negative space refers to the empty space
,,,in between your content on the slide .
TQiln3CjtvM24,1.56,2,Sometimes we feel the urge to make use of
,,,every little space available to u on the slide .
TQiln3CjtvM25,2.03,2.07,We plaster it with information and visual element
,,,but more is n't necessarily always better .
TQiln3CjtvM26,2.11,2.16,If you throw too much on the screen
,,,you get a cluttered page that 's unattractive
,,,and difficult to read .
TQiln3CjtvM27,2.17,2.2,People get frustrated when information bombard them
,,,you 're going to lose their attention .
TQiln3CjtvM28,2.22,2.22,So do n't do that .
TQiln3CjtvM29,2.24,2.31,White space is also important
,,,because it creates separation between the object
,,,on your slide and it focus the eye and the message
,,,you want to get across .
TQiln3CjtvM30,2.33,2.33,It also make text easier to read .
TQiln3CjtvM31,2.37,2.37,And also for the viewer it 's calming letting them breathe .
TQiln3CjtvM32,2.41,2.43,And do n't get me wrong
,,,white space doe n't have to be white .
TQiln3CjtvM33,2.45,2.48,White space can also be any solid color
,,,or even a blurred background .
TQiln3CjtvM34,2.51,2.54,It just mean that there is no other content
,,,or design element .
TQiln3CjtvM35,2.55,2.55,Apple is a master when it come to applying this concept .
TQiln3CjtvM36,2.59,3.02,It creates the feeling of luxury
,,,and put the product in focus .
TQiln3CjtvM37,3.05,3.12,So when designing PowerPoint slide
,,,do n't create slide like this
,,,which result in visual overload
,,,the viewer eye will be all over the place .
TQiln3CjtvM38,3.15,3.15,Instead remember a few key rule .
TQiln3CjtvM39,3.18,3.18,Keep the slide background clean .
TQiln3CjtvM40,3.2,3.24,Company logo and other corporate identity element
,,,do n't have to be on every single slide .
TQiln3CjtvM41,3.26,3.26,White space principle also apply to your text on the slide .
TQiln3CjtvM42,3.3,3.3,Use a font size that 's big enough with generous spacing .
TQiln3CjtvM43,3.34,3.37,If you ca n't fit all your text this way
,,,it 's probably too much text .
TQiln3CjtvM44,3.39,3.39,So it come down to le is more .
TQiln3CjtvM45,3.43,3.43,Give the element on your slide some breathing room .
TQiln3CjtvM46,3.46,3.5,This way the eye land straight on the main message
,,,and the slide is going to have a greater impact .
TQiln3CjtvM47,3.53,3.53,Number three apply instant design idea .
TQiln3CjtvM48,3.57,4,Design idea is a new feature in Microsoft 365
,,,that 's powered by Microsoft 's AI or intelligence service .
TQiln3CjtvM49,4.05,4.11,You can find it on the Home tab
,,,which a we know is the prime real estate
,,,in any Office product .
TQiln3CjtvM50,4.13,4.17,So what doe it do ?
,,,Let 's say we have this rather uninspiring slide
,,,about some timeline .
TQiln3CjtvM51,4.19,4.19,And we want to make it more visually appealing .
TQiln3CjtvM52,4.22,4.24,If you click on Design Ideas up here
,,,it will make several suggestion .
TQiln3CjtvM53,4.27,4.27,Like this one .
TQiln3CjtvM54,4.28,4.28,Or this one is nice too .
TQiln3CjtvM55,4.3,4.32,And immediately by just clicking a button
,,,you have a much improved version of the slide .
TQiln3CjtvM56,4.36,4.41,Or if you work with image in your slide
,,,design idea can convert these uncropped picture
,,,into a neatly organized slide automatically for you .
TQiln3CjtvM57,4.45,4.45,Like this one .
TQiln3CjtvM58,4.47,4.47,It also doe n't seem to like bullet point that much .
TQiln3CjtvM59,4.5,4.52,So if it see a slide like this
,,,it will suggest a more visual version of the slide .
TQiln3CjtvM60,4.56,5.03,You can exchange the icon or color a you like
,,,but if the shape or color is a part of the slide background
,,,you ca n't adjust it .
TQiln3CjtvM61,5.05,5.1,If you have poor design skill like me
,,,or if you 're just in a hurry
,,,then design idea can definitely give you a good start .
TQiln3CjtvM62,5.14,5.14,Number four use Scalable Vector Graphics .
TQiln3CjtvM63,5.18,5.18,The next tip is about the image in your presentation .
TQiln3CjtvM64,5.22,5.27,When you use raster image like JPGs or PNGs in your slide
,,,be careful when resizing them .
TQiln3CjtvM65,5.3,5.32,Take a look at this Excel logo here
,,,it look fine in the current size .
TQiln3CjtvM66,5.34,5.37,I can scale it down without problem
,,,but when I scale it up it 's going to become pixelated .
TQiln3CjtvM67,5.41,5.41,Scaling down is okay scaling up is not .
TQiln3CjtvM68,5.45,5.45,Not if you have these image .
TQiln3CjtvM69,5.47,5.52,But if you use SVGs
,,,which is short for Scalable Vector Graphics
,,,you can scale up without pixelation .
TQiln3CjtvM70,5.55,6.02,SVGs can be resized from small to large
,,,without losing quality because they consist of
,,,mathematical line and fill instead of pixel .
TQiln3CjtvM71,6.06,6.06,They are also much smaller in size .
TQiln3CjtvM72,6.09,6.16,For example the icon option in the insert tab are SVGs
,,,and recent version of PowerPoint
,,,allows you to edit these graphic .
TQiln3CjtvM73,6.18,6.26,You can use the eyedropper tool to change the fill
,,,or you can even disassemble the SVG image by converting it
,,,to an Office shape .
TQiln3CjtvM74,6.27,6.3,This way you can change the fill of individual part
,,,of the image .
TQiln3CjtvM75,6.32,6.34,So whenever you can choose vector graphic
,,,over raster image .
TQiln3CjtvM76,6.36,6.4,You can scale them up without loss of resolution
,,,and they are smaller in size a well .
TQiln3CjtvM77,6.43,6.43,Number five apply the rule of third .
TQiln3CjtvM78,6.47,6.52,In photography and cinematography
,,,there is a basic guideline about how a shot
,,,should be composed .
TQiln3CjtvM79,6.54,6.54,It 's called the rule of third .
TQiln3CjtvM80,6.56,6.56,This also applies to PowerPoint slide .
TQiln3CjtvM81,6.58,6.58,Let me show you how .
TQiln3CjtvM82,7,7,Here we have a slide with an image and some text .
TQiln3CjtvM83,7.04,7.04,Let 's see how we can improve it .
TQiln3CjtvM84,7.06,7.09,The rule of third basically divide the canvas
,,,into three horizontal row and three vertical column .
TQiln3CjtvM85,7.13,7.13,The line intersect at these four point .
TQiln3CjtvM86,7.16,7.18,Guess what these are called ?
,,,PowerPoints .
TQiln3CjtvM87,7.2,7.27,What are the odds ?
,,,The rule say that the key element of this slide
,,,should be pleased to run these PowerPoints
,,,or along the line .
TQiln3CjtvM88,7.28,7.35,So let 's position the image like this with the head
,,,on this PowerPoint and the text box
,,,along the horizontal line like this .
TQiln3CjtvM89,7.38,7.38,Let 's compare them side by side .
TQiln3CjtvM90,7.4,7.44,What do you think ?
,,,Most people will prefer to second version
,,,it 's just more visually appealing .
TQiln3CjtvM91,7.46,7.49,An easy way to apply the rule of third in PowerPoint
,,,is by using the guide .
TQiln3CjtvM92,7.51,7.51,Just go to the View tab and check the box next to guide .
TQiln3CjtvM93,7.56,7.59,You can add an additional horizontal and vertical guide
,,,to create the grid .
TQiln3CjtvM94,8.01,8.01,Give the rule of third a try and check it out for yourself .
TQiln3CjtvM95,8.04,8.05,So these are my tip
,,,when it come to PowerPoint slide design .
TQiln3CjtvM96,8.08,8.08,I hope you found them helpful .
TQiln3CjtvM97,8.1,8.22,If you 're interested in design in general
,,,and you 'd like to explore other area
,,,such a logo design or brand identity
,,,or just the core principle of visual design
,,,check out the graphic design class on Skillshare .
TQiln3CjtvM98,8.25,8.27,I personally enjoy the Graphic Design Basics course

,,,together with many example of the five basic
,,,design principle .
TQiln3CjtvM100,8.38,8.47,Aside from this class you 're going to find class
,,,on many other topic in Skillshare

Iwpi1Lm6dFo1,0.11,0.11,Okay lady and gentleman welcome .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo2,0.14,1.05,There is a question
,,,which ha puzzled me for quite a while
,,,and that is Why do our PowerPoints look the way they look ?
,,,Or rather How on earth can we accept that they look the way they look ?
,,,How can you do that ?
,,,And do you know
,,,what 's even more intellectually challenging for me to understand ?
,,,It 's How can a person sit over here in this meeting room with 10 others
,,,observing this dismally bad PowerPoint
,,,filled with chart graphical element page number
,,,fading away five seven minute thinking of other thing ?
,,,You know the feeling the boredom the waste of time ?
,,,This person after 40 minute
,,,he or she will stand up a bit dazed
,,,trotting off to his own office coming to his own computer
,,,flipping it up going like 'Oh my god I 've got a presentation tomorrow
,,,and I do have a PowerPoint to build . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo3,1.05,1.2,Now what is the chance that this person will build an equally bad PowerPoint
,,,a the one that he or she wa herself tortured by
,,,in the other conference room ?
,,,Is that a big chance ?
,,,Yeah .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo4,1.21,1.25,Now what is that ?
,,,Why do we do that ? Is that vengeance ?
,,,Is that where you go like 'You did that to me .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo5,1.28,1.28,Phew ! I 'm going to do it to you . You got it coming bro ' ?
Iwpi1Lm6dFo6,1.28,1.31,Is that the case ? I do n't think so .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo7,1.34,1.34,I do n't think that 's got to do with vengeance intelligence .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo8,1.38,1.38,I think it 's got to do with something else .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo9,1.4,1.43,Now my passion in life is the brain
,,,and an even bigger passion that is presentation skill .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo10,1.46,1.46,And I love combining these two .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo11,1.49,2.03,And about four year ago
,,,I got so so upset I blew my top
,,,because the way that we do neural execution
,,,all over our boardroom today is just
,,,it 's not fair to our intelligence a being Homo sapiens .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo12,2.07,2.19,So I thought there 's got to be something we can do about this
,,,so I searched the world I looked for seminar
,,,I looked for training program I looked for book
,,,that could solve this question for me
,,,but there wa none to be found .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo13,2.21,2.25,So I thought 'Well I 'll just do a Franz Kafka said
,,, If it is n't written write it yourself . '' '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo14,2.25,2.29,And four year later
,,,I have the great honour to stand here in front of you .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo15,2.32,2.36,What am I talking about ?
,,,What are the PowerPoints I 'm referring to ?
,,,They can look like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo16,2.37,2.41,Now this is one of the top three university in the world
,,,advising their student and their teacher on how to build great PowerPoints .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo17,2.48,2.54,I received this from a customer
,,,and you 've got to be semi
,,,in order to even have something like this in the company .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo18,2.58,2.58,I love this one .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo19,3,3.03,This one wa awarded the prize of being the worst PowerPoint
,,,delivered by a public CEO in 2010 .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo20,3.06,3.08,It 's a nice prize to pick up is n't it ?
,,,'Oh yes thank you . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo21,3.08,3.1,Well done mate .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo22,3.12,3.12,And then you 're like 'This is bad . Can it get worse ? '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo23,3.12,3.16,Yes it can .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo24,3.2,3.23,Now this is the UN in Afghanistan
,,,the US military describing the situation in the area .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo25,3.28,3.28,And well there are no comment on that .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo26,3.32,3.32,But then we get this one .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo27,3.33,3.33,'My god David Phillips this ha got to be the thing .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo28,3.37,3.37,This ha got limited amount of text .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo29,3.39,3.39,It 's got a supporting image .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo30,3.41,3.41,It 's got a clear headline .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo31,3.42,3.42,This is the truth . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo32,3.42,4.06,Well the thing is
,,,if you recognise yourself in any of these
,,,which I think you do nodding away
,,,I want to make you aware of the following :
,,,that if you 've delivered a presentation with something like that behind you
,,,90 % of what you said
,,,wa gone within 30 second .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo33,4.09,4.21,And then you go 'No no no way Jose
,,,that is way I know it 's bad but it ca n't be that bad
,,,can it now really ? '
,,,Well just let me give you an example of really how bad your working memory is
,,,and mine for that case .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo34,4.23,4.23,I want you to imagine this situation .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo35,4.25,4.25,You 're at the train station waiting for the train .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo36,4.28,4.28,You can see it coming on the horizon .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo37,4.3,4.3,You 're fiddling away you finally find where you put your ticket .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo38,4.33,4.33,And you take it out and you go 'Car five seat 42 . Got it . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo39,4.33,4.33,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo40,4.33,4.42,Have you ?
,,,You have absolutely no idea where you 're going to sit do you ?
,,,So you 're like 'Is this only me or ... Well I 'll check . Five 42 . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo41,4.42,4.42,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo42,4.42,4.42,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo43,4.42,4.46,You put it down again .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo44,4.47,4.48,Have you got it ?
,,,No you have n't got it .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo45,4.49,4.49,You 'll do this on an average of six time before you sit down .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo46,4.53,4.56,I 've seen people in the train go
,,,'Five 42 five 42 . Yes this is my seat check . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo47,4.56,4.56,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo48,4.56,5.07,Now the bad news in the situation is this :
,,,you do not have a separate working memory for PowerPoint
,,,and a separate working memory for train ticket .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo49,5.1,5.1,It 's the same dismally bad working memory for both activity .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo50,5.17,5.27,So I might be harsh when I say this
,,,but there is one man on this earth
,,,who know more about the brain than anybody else
,,,one of the most leading neurologist called John Medina
,,,and he put it like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo51,5.29,5.33,[ If company would have a little respect for business
,,,a they have for presentation
,,,the majority would go bankrupt . ]
Iwpi1Lm6dFo52,5.33,5.35,And it 's with his word that I welcome you to 'How to Avoid Death by PowerPoint ' .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo53,5.42,5.49,Now my objective for this evening for these 18 minute
,,,is to give you five design principle
,,,that will cognitively and psychologically optimise your PowerPoint slide .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo54,5.54,5.59,And if you have n't used them before
,,,they will make a tremendous difference
,,,to every PowerPoint you 'll be delivering from this day and on .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo55,6.05,6.05,So let 's start .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo56,6.06,6.06,The first one of these five is one message .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo57,6.08,6.13,I received this from a customer
,,,and I said 'Hey we 've got a lot of issue in here
,,,but let 's start with the first one .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo58,6.15,6.15,You 've got two message .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo59,6.16,6.16,Let 's move one of them out of the way and just bring one message per slide . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo60,6.16,6.24,So why should we only have one message per slide ?
,,,Well I 'll give you this beautiful example .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo61,6.26,6.31,You 're at this nice party you 've got the music going boom
,,,you 've got this person you 're chatting away to
,,,you 're having a good time .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo62,6.34,6.34,And then you hear your name ; you hear your name spoken somewhere .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo63,6.37,6.46,Your entire attention is now diverted in that direction
,,,and with this person you 're just nodding away
,,,hoping that you 're nodding in the right instance yeah ?
,,,Yes yes yes .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo64,6.47,6.49,After a minute this one stop talking about you
,,,so you divert your attention straight again .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo65,6.51,6.57,Now that person will then say 'Well do n't you agree ? '
,,,And do n't we just love that situation ?
,,,We have got no clue what they 've been talking about .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo66,7,7,The same thing go for PowerPoint .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo67,7.01,7.07,If you 've got more than one message
,,,the chance is big they will be focusing on this one and not that one
,,,or that one and not this one .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo68,7.09,7.09,Just make it simple for human being .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo69,7.11,7.11,Have one message per slide .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo70,7.12,7.12,We are extremely limited to understanding more .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo71,7.17,7.17,Let 's move on . Go to working memory .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo72,7.17,7.17,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo73,7.19,7.23,I 've already given you this bad vibe that your working memory is bad
,,,and I 'm afraid I 'm not coming with better news .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo74,7.27,7.27,I 'm coming with worse news and it go like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo75,7.3,7.39,This equation ha the basis of John Sweller and Mayer
,,,and they come to the conclusion
,,,that there is something in our brain called 'the redundancy effect '
,,,and it work like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo76,7.41,7.54,If you have text sentence on your PowerPoint
,,,and you persist with the annoying idea of speaking at the same time
,,,what will be remembered by the audience
,,,is zero .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo77,7.57,7.57,Or very close to zero .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo78,7.59,8.03,Now why is that ? How doe that come about ?
,,,Well it ca n't look like this . It 's just not practical .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo79,8.03,8.03,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo80,8.07,8.07,You ca n't stand and have this and talk at the same time .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo81,8.09,8.11,So what are you supposed to do ?
,,,Well use PowerPoint for what it 's supposed to be used for .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo82,8.15,8.21,Pick it like this pull down your text into the documentation field
,,,and use the area up there for the presentation material :
,,,short sweet bit of text and an image .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo83,8.24,8.24,That is what enhances your image .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo84,8.26,8.26,That is what enhances your message .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo85,8.28,8.28,So use PowerPoint a it 's supposed to be used .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo86,8.33,8.35,Come to the third of these five principle
,,,and that 's size .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo87,8.37,8.38,Before I go into that
,,,I want to make you aware the following .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo88,8.42,8.53,Every time you open your eye for the rest of your life
,,,you will focus on four thing :
,,,moving object signalling colour like red orange and yellow
,,,contrast object and big object for the rest of your life .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo89,8.58,8.58,Give you a practical example of that .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo90,9,9,Imagine yourself being home with a friend a really good friend .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo91,9.03,9.03,Now the television is on but the sound is off .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo92,9.07,9.12,You 're having a great conversation
,,,but do you find it easy to not look at the television ?
,,,No . Why not ?
Iwpi1Lm6dFo93,9.12,9.18,Because it 's got moving object
,,,it 's got signalling colour it 's high in contrast
,,,and they 're usually very big these time .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo94,9.22,9.3,So why not use this to our benefit ?
,,,If you look at this where is your attention drawn to
,,,without you even having a chance of controlling it ?
,,,It 's going to the big three all the time .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo95,9.33,9.33,Have a look at the practical situation ; have a look at this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo96,9.36,9.37,Where are your eye drawn to ?
,,,I can see that they 're drawn constantly to the headline .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo97,9.41,9.45,Now how often is the headline the most important part in a PowerPoint ?
,,,It 's very rare .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo98,9.48,9.56,Even so every PowerPoint template is built like this
,,,where the headline is the biggest object and the content is the smallest
,,,going absolute opposite to our biological reaction .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo99,10,10.03,So what doe this look like if we just show you an example ?
,,,Well now I 've reduced the title and it look like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo100,10.06,10.13,Do you see how your eye now fall down into the content ?
,,,Now they 're sucked into the headline
,,,and now they 're falling down into the content .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo101,10.15,10.31,So I can control exactly where you are
,,,but why do people build PowerPoints
,,,where people will be spending 70 % of the time on the headline
,,,when it 's not the most important part ?
,,,So what I want you to take with you from this
,,,is the most important part of your PowerPoint
,,,should also be the biggest nothing else .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo102,10.35,10.35,Moving on to number four contrast .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo103,10.41,10.41,Contrast control your focus .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo104,10.44,10.49,So what doe that look like ?
,,,For instance if I show you a list like this
,,,your eye are over the place
,,,because you do n't really know what to focus on .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo105,10.51,10.51,So I 'll use a built functionality into PowerPoint which go like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo106,10.55,10.59,I 'll show you the first subject I 'll take it away with contrast
,,,and I 'll show you the second one
,,,and I 'll do it again and again and again and again .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo107,11.03,11.03,You 're now following exactly the white spot .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo108,11.05,11.13,If I do this dun
,,,I can see your eye just wobbling around
,,,and you 're a bit like a kitten going after a little laser pointer on the wall
,,,going like 'Where is it ? I 've got it . I 've got it . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo109,11.13,11.13,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo110,11.13,11.16,Because you 're following where the white spot is and not the rest .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo111,11.2,11.2,Now this is a beautiful example .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo112,11.21,11.21,Please do use this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo113,11.23,11.27,Use it because you can show amazing big table like this
,,,if you use the effect of contrast the principle of contrast .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo114,11.29,11.29,Look what this look like .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo115,11.31,11.36,Your eye are all over the place ; you do n't know what to focus on
,,,but I just apply the principle of contrast
,,,and it look like that and suddenly you know exactly what to focus on .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo116,11.4,11.41,Here they 're all over the place
,,,and here they 're exactly where I want them .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo117,11.45,11.53,Now there 's a big major drawback with PowerPoints
,,,and that is that the majority of company on this earth today
,,,they persist in having white background in PowerPoint .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo118,11.57,11.57,Look at that .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo119,11.58,11.58,Oh it 's bright it 's shiny .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo120,12,12.04,Could you tell me who ha the highest contrast me or the screen ?
,,,Well the screen .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo121,12.06,12.08,Who 's usually the biggest me or the screen ?
,,,Well the screen .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo122,12.09,12.23,So the only option I have is dress myself up in signalling colour
,,,and jump around on stage in order to balance that problem out
,,,and that is obviously not a good corporate strategy
,,,in the long term would it be ?
,,,I think the long strategy is to just switch it around .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo123,12.26,12.26,PowerPoint is not supposed to have white background .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo124,12.29,12.29,If I do this your eye relax .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo125,12.31,12.31,You focus on me .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo126,12.32,12.32,I 'm the biggest object .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo127,12.33,12.33,I 'm the most contrast object .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo128,12.37,12.37,I got your focus .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo129,12.38,12.45,Why is that important ?
,,,It 's important because I am I always have been
,,,and I always will be the presentation .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo130,12.48,12.48,That is my visual aid .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo131,12.56,12.56,Moving into the last principle and that is object .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo132,13.03,13.06,Now this is one of the most severe principle
,,,and it go like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo133,13.07,13.1,How many object do I have here ?
,,,If you count them quickly you 'll see that I 've got 16 .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo134,13.12,13.2,Do you see this little beauty at the end a well
,,,which go 'page 12 of 95 ' ?
,,,What is that ?
,,,Why do we do that ?
,,,That only creates anxiety .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo135,13.22,13.22,If anything you are 'Oh my god I ca n't take 83 more of those . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo136,13.22,13.31,But it can also create hope
,,,because imagine ...
Iwpi1Lm6dFo137,13.33,13.33,imagine when it 's 90 out of 95 .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo138,13.36,13.36,'Oh I can see the light ; I can see the end of the tunnel . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo139,13.36,13.42,Kidding aside do n't do that .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo140,13.45,13.54,Now there are so many idea out there
,,,on how many object you 're supposed to have in PowerPoint
,,,and once and for all I just want to put my foot down
,,,and state to you that this is the perfect amount .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo141,13.57,13.57,In order to do that I want you to just feel it yourself .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo142,14,14.02,How many object are you supposed to have ?
,,,And we 're going to do that by showing you a couple of ball .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo143,14.06,14.06,I 'll throw up the ball .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo144,14.07,14.07,I want you to nod to me when you 've counted them .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo145,14.09,14.09,Simple instruction . You with me ?
Iwpi1Lm6dFo146,14.09,14.12,Cool here we go .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo147,14.16,14.16,Alright take you about two second .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo148,14.19,14.19,Good . Well done .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo149,14.19,14.19,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo150,14.21,14.21,Your next set of ball .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo151,14.22,14.22,Count them and nod to me when you 've counted them .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo152,14.25,14.25,Here we go .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo153,14.27,14.27,Excellent . Yeah .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo154,14.27,14.27,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo155,14.28,14.3,That took you about 1.2 second if you 're normal
,,,which about 90 % of you seem to be .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo156,14.34,14.34,We 'll have the third set of ball the last one .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo157,14.37,14.37,Look at this nod to me when you 've counted them .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo158,14.4,14.43,Oh what wa that ?
,,,I just pressed the button and you nodded simultaneously .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo159,14.47,14.51,That will if you are normal take you 0.2 second
,,,two of a second .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo160,14.53,14.53,This will take you 1.2 this will take you two of a second .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo161,14.57,15,And for anyone of you who you 're good at math
,,,you 'll find out that that number is approximately 500 % difference .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo162,15.05,15.07,How is that even remotely possible ?
,,,There are only two object in difference .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo163,15.11,15.15,Well might I suggest the following :
,,,this one you have to count
,,,and this one you see .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo164,15.17,15.3,Could that be correct ?
,,,So what you 've just experienced is the following :
,,,that the cognitive process of counting
,,,take 500 % longer time requires 500 % more energy resource
,,,to execute than just seeing .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo165,15.36,15.51,So what I want you to keep in mind at all time
,,,what I want you to keep in your head is this :
,,,which is the Swedish number for this :
,,,[ Six ]
,,,The magical number is six .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo166,15.53,15.53,It 's not five it 's not seven it 's six .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo167,15.57,15.57,And I want to make you aware of this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo168,15.59,16.13,When you go into a presentation in the future
,,,and you 've built this amazing PowerPoint
,,,if you 've got more than seven object or seven or more object
,,,you have to be aware that all the people in there
,,,they have to use 500 % more energy and cognitive resource
,,,to understand what 's in your PowerPoint .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo169,16.16,16.28,Now how do you think
,,,their energy brain by nature behaves ?
,,,Will it go like 'Ooh I 'll easily invest 500 % more cognitive resource
,,,to understand this weird slide '
,,,or ' I wo n't ' ?
,,,' I wo n't . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo170,16.28,16.29,And you 've just incurred death by PowerPoint .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo171,16.33,16.36,Now what doe this look like in real life ?
,,,Well have a look at this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo172,16.37,16.4,Sixteen object can we agree that that 's too many ?
,,,Yes we can .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo173,16.42,16.44,So what doe it look like if we reduce it ?
,,,Look at this . We go from this to this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo174,16.44,16.44,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo175,16.48,16.48,And this is where your brain go 'Ahh ' .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo176,16.52,16.52,And this is where your brain go 'Ugh ' .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo177,16.55,16.55,Ahh .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo178,17.01,17.14,And I assume that in the future
,,,when you deliver PowerPoints to your colleague to your fellow people
,,,you want them to go 'Ahh '
,,,when you show them your slide .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo179,17.16,17.16,You do n't want them to go 'Ugh ' .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo180,17.23,17.35,Now there is have you seen this movie
,,,'The Rain Man ' by Dustin Hoffman ?
,,,Seen that ?
,,,It 's a beauty is n't it ?
,,,He come into this cafeteria and somebody drop toothpick
,,,and he go like 'Boom 247 . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo181,17.35,17.4,It 's amazing is n't it ?
,,,His perceptive limit is here .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo182,17.43,17.47,Your perceptive limit
,,,is here .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo183,17.5,18.06,Now what amazes me
,,,is that whichever country I go to whichever company I see
,,,it seems like they build PowerPoints
,,,in the hope that all their fellow colleague are autistic or savant
,,,which obviously is not the case .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo184,18.11,18.11,So but then you go like this 'But David my god .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo185,18.16,18.16,This mean that I have to have more slide . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo186,18.16,18.23,'Yes that is entirely correct .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo187,18.26,18.26,You have understood me clearly . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo188,18.26,18.33,I want to make one thing clear here
,,,and that is that the amount of slide in your PowerPoint
,,,ha never been the problem .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo189,18.38,18.38,It is the amount of object per slide which ha been the problem .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo190,18.45,18.53,The stupid idea
,,,that corporate organisation all over the world
,,,they 've come up with limitation going like
,,,'Ooh we 've got this clever idea :
,,,You ca n't use 40 slide . You can only use four . '
Iwpi1Lm6dFo191,18.53,18.53,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo192,18.53,19.01,So what do people do ?
,,,Well they take the content of the rest 36
,,,and they jam it in the first four .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo193,19.03,19.07,My god is that counterproductive or what ?
,,,And we call ourselves intelligent .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo194,19.11,19.11,No no .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo195,19.12,19.14,Alright so compared
,,,I started off with 95 of those .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo196,19.19,19.19,We ended up with 135 of these .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo197,19.23,19.26,And yes it gave an immediate result
,,,to the application that we were working for .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo198,19.3,19.3,So to summarise this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo199,19.33,19.35,Let 's have some fun and do a cross
,,,because obviously I have to prove my point .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo200,19.37,19.41,Do you remember more than 90 % of what I said ?
,,,I 'm not going to be that harsh .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo201,19.42,19.42,Let 's do a crossword instead .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo202,19.45,19.45,It 's going to go like this .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo203,19.46,19.46,Words are going to come up .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo204,19.48,19.48,I 'm going to ask you to scream them out a loud a you can a we go along .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo205,19.51,19.55,How many message are you supposed to have per slide ?
,,,One . Very good .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo206,19.55,19.55,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo207,19.58,19.58,I think you were looking for a different word there .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo208,20.03,20.05,What can we use to steer our focus ?
,,,( Audience ) Contrast .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo209,20.06,20.07,Yes and another one ?
,,,( Audience ) Size .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo210,20.08,20.08,Well done .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo211,20.09,20.12,What should we avoid using if speaking at the same time ?
,,,( Audience ) Sentences .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo212,20.13,20.13,Beautiful .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo213,20.14,20.16,And what kind of background should we have ?
,,,We should have dark .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo214,20.18,20.18,And finally now you can say it .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo215,20.19,20.21,How many object per slide ?
,,,Six . That is magnificent .
Iwpi1Lm6dFo216,20.21,20.21,
Iwpi1Lm6dFo217,20.24,20.24,Thank you very much .

PgOD1j2DhNg18,2,2.03,And on my Instagram I share even more content that will
,,,help you succeed in the first year of your career .
PgOD1j2DhNg19,2.05,2.1,Today I am talking to you about lot of little tip
,,,and trick that I learned a a consultant working
,,,at McKinsey for six year .
PgOD1j2DhNg20,2.12,2.14,I share design principle that consultant apply for
,,,literally every single presentation that they use .
PgOD1j2DhNg21,2.17,2.25,Little element that typically appear on slide that
,,,almost every consultant use every day
,,,but that I rarely see on presentation outside of the
,,,consulting world .
PgOD1j2DhNg22,2.26,2.31,So if you 're interested to learn lot of little tip
,,,and trick that you can use for your
,,,slide presentation a well .
PgOD1j2DhNg23,2.32,2.32,Look at this video until the end .
PgOD1j2DhNg24,2.34,2.46,And if you 're one of those people that are
,,,really interested to take your slide presentation
,,,game to the next level
,,,I even released a multi course and all the
,,,tip and trick that I learned at McKinsey on how you make
,,,top management style presentation .
PgOD1j2DhNg25,2.48,2.51,There are already over 10000 student
,,,taking the course .
PgOD1j2DhNg26,2.52,2.55,If you 're interested in that
,,,I leave a link to the course in the
,,,description down below .
PgOD1j2DhNg27,2.56,3,So if you 'd like to learn more about that
,,,and also read lot of student review
,,,feel free to have a look and check out the course .
PgOD1j2DhNg28,3.02,3.02,But now let 's dive into that .
PgOD1j2DhNg29,3.04,3.06,I prepared a bunch of slide for you that just
,,,illustrate my point .
PgOD1j2DhNg30,3.08,3.1,Let 's now switch to my computer to have a look
,,,how this look like .
PgOD1j2DhNg31,3.11,3.11,Alright let 's jump into it .
PgOD1j2DhNg32,3.13,3.13,So let 's start with some basic .
PgOD1j2DhNg33,3.15,3.17,Some basic element that should be included
,,,on every single page .
PgOD1j2DhNg34,3.18,3.18,So let 's start here on the bottom .
PgOD1j2DhNg35,3.2,3.2,What you see here is the date .
PgOD1j2DhNg36,3.21,3.21,The current date .
PgOD1j2DhNg37,3.22,3.27,And pretty frequently you put here the date
,,,either when the presentation happened
,,,where you present your page
,,,or when you created a document .
PgOD1j2DhNg38,3.29,3.41,Because what you will also find is that many document
,,,in professional context
,,,many presentation many slide
,,,are not actually created for actual presentation
,,,but rather a a document that is then circulated
,,,sent around in a company .
PgOD1j2DhNg39,3.42,3.47,And a date is just important
,,,because when in retrospect
,,,you 're able to actually know
,,,to understand when the document wa created .
PgOD1j2DhNg40,3.49,3.49,Which of course is important in many way .
PgOD1j2DhNg41,3.51,3.56,The second thing that you 'll include on
,,,pretty much every page
,,,is a page number .
PgOD1j2DhNg42,3.57,4.02,This of course is very useful if you sit
,,,in a meeting and just a colleague want
,,,to refer to a specific page .
PgOD1j2DhNg43,4.03,4.1,Then to be able to say okay
,,,this is a page 18 and then everybody know
,,,what page 18 exactly is
,,,because there is a page number included on the document .
PgOD1j2DhNg44,4.13,4.13,Then of course is very important .
PgOD1j2DhNg45,4.15,4.15,Next thing you should look at is the source .
PgOD1j2DhNg46,4.17,4.19,So here you can include a source
,,,such a Firm Learning .
PgOD1j2DhNg47,4.21,4.27,Of course you can even then include just your name
,,,or your department a a source
,,,but even better would be especially if you refer to a
,,,specific data then also give the source of the data .
PgOD1j2DhNg48,4.31,4.39,So what date are you using ?
,,,Where is the data coming from ?
,,,When wa the date collected ?
,,,Some specific information on what data you 're using
,,,is what you can likely include here in the source .
PgOD1j2DhNg49,4.41,4.41,The next element that you can use are footnote .
PgOD1j2DhNg50,4.43,4.46,So footnote one two three this is just a part where
,,,you can give specific detail on certain thing .
PgOD1j2DhNg51,4.48,4.51,But maybe just not fit in the
,,,regular text on your page .
PgOD1j2DhNg52,4.53,4.58,Then you would just include it in the footnote
,,,to give you some extra space
,,,because it 's often a smaller font size
,,,than the main page .
PgOD1j2DhNg53,5,5,Just to show additional remark .
PgOD1j2DhNg54,5.01,5.04,And of course
,,,one of the most important element
,,,of every page is the action title .
PgOD1j2DhNg55,5.06,5.06,The action title is the title of the page .
PgOD1j2DhNg56,5.09,5.09,And creating a good action title is an art form itself .
PgOD1j2DhNg57,5.14,5.2,Now I will not go into much of detail
,,,in this video what a good action title look like
,,,because I already created a specific video
,,,only focusing on action title .
PgOD1j2DhNg58,5.22,5.25,The video even includes an exercise how you can
,,,improve your action title creation skill .
PgOD1j2DhNg59,5.28,5.29,If you 're interested in that
,,,have a look .
PgOD1j2DhNg60,5.31,5.34,I will include a link to the video above
,,,so that you can directly look into it .
PgOD1j2DhNg61,5.35,5.35,So far so good .
PgOD1j2DhNg62,5.36,5.39,So this wa some just really bare basic
,,,that should be included in every page .
PgOD1j2DhNg63,5.4,5.4,Let 's jump into something else .
PgOD1j2DhNg64,5.41,5.41,And this is the creation of chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg65,5.44,5.49,So what you will see in consulting
,,,is that almost every slide that you use
,,,contains a chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg66,5.5,5.5,So some kind of diagram where you depict data .
PgOD1j2DhNg67,5.53,5.55,The reason is that in consulting
,,,very frequently your argumentation will be based on data .
PgOD1j2DhNg68,5.59,6.02,You can just expect from you
,,,that you will back up your finding
,,,and your recommendation with some date analysis .
PgOD1j2DhNg69,6.05,6.1,And if you do these kind of data analysis
,,,of course you will frequently use chart to then
,,,show the result of your analysis .
PgOD1j2DhNg70,6.12,6.14,And these are just the chart that you can create
,,,with the think expansion .
PgOD1j2DhNg71,6.16,6.19,If you do not know think
,,,it 's a plugin that very frequently is used
,,,by consulting firm to create the chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg72,6.22,6.22,So almost every consulting firm us it .
PgOD1j2DhNg73,6.24,6.28,Of course if you do not have it
,,,you can just also work with the regular
,,,PowerPoint built chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg74,6.29,6.32,If you have the opportunity to use think
,,,I can highly recommend it
,,,because it really improves your workflow .
PgOD1j2DhNg75,6.34,6.37,If you now go over this chart tile
,,,many of them you will already know
,,,and probably frequently use yourself .
PgOD1j2DhNg76,6.39,6.42,Such a stacked bar chart or the 100 % bar chart
,,,clustered bar chart and so on .
PgOD1j2DhNg77,6.44,6.46,Right now I 'd just like to put your attention to
,,,the waterfall chart type .
PgOD1j2DhNg78,6.48,6.52,So the waterfall chart type is a chart type
,,,that in consulting
,,,especially at McKinsey you will use all of the time .
PgOD1j2DhNg79,6.54,6.56,So there 's almost no presentation
,,,without a waterfall present .
PgOD1j2DhNg80,6.58,6.58,But outside of consulting I really rarely see it .
PgOD1j2DhNg81,7.01,7.01,Just from my observation .
PgOD1j2DhNg82,7.03,7.08,The fact alone that a presentation includes a
,,,waterfall chart very often is a clear telltale sign
,,,that a MBB consulting firm worked on it .
PgOD1j2DhNg83,7.11,7.18,And actually most of the case it ha been McKinsey
,,,because for whatever reason
,,,waterfall chart are just so commonly used
,,,by McKinsey consultant .
PgOD1j2DhNg84,7.19,7.19,So let 's look at an example .
PgOD1j2DhNg85,7.2,7.22,So this is just a basic example
,,,of what a waterfall chart look like .
PgOD1j2DhNg86,7.24,7.3,And I 'd just like to use this example to show to you
,,,what I believe the waterfall chart can just be so
,,,helpful in so many business presentation .
PgOD1j2DhNg87,7.33,7.37,So this of course is just a stylist chart
,,,an illustrative chart so let 's not
,,,care about the specific number .
PgOD1j2DhNg88,7.38,7.38,But this is now a bridge chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg89,7.41,7.43,Actually many people instead of using waterfall
,,,they also just call them bridge .
PgOD1j2DhNg90,7.45,7.45,So bridge chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg91,7.46,7.47,Because waterfall chart are very helpful
,,,to show a bridge .
PgOD1j2DhNg92,7.49,7.49,To show how one number relates to another number .
PgOD1j2DhNg93,7.52,7.54,One way that this is frequently used
,,,is to show bridge between financial figure .
PgOD1j2DhNg94,7.56,7.56,So here we compare the EBITDA .
PgOD1j2DhNg95,7.58,8.01,So the earnings before interest text depreciation
,,,amortization of 2019 . To the EBITDA in 2020
PgOD1j2DhNg96,8.01,8.04,and we like to understand the difference .
PgOD1j2DhNg97,8.07,8.08,And if you just look at the number
,,,here it ha been 1.59 and here it ha been 1.67 .
PgOD1j2DhNg98,8.12,8.15,So at first glance it could look like the number
,,,are pretty similar .
PgOD1j2DhNg99,8.16,8.2,So you could infer
,,,that actually the company ha been quite stable
,,,there were many thing that actually changed .
PgOD1j2DhNg100,8.22,8.29,If you do n't break down the difference of these
,,,two number into all the effect
,,,that actually changed
,,,from 2019
,,,to 2020 .
PgOD1j2DhNg101,8.31,8.32,You 'd see that there are quite
,,,some thing going on .
PgOD1j2DhNg102,8.34,8.41,So here wa one effect that if you use
,,,the EBITDA by 700
,,,but then this is compensated by another effect
,,,that increased it by 730 .
PgOD1j2DhNg103,8.42,8.44,And there 's another positive effect
,,,further increasing it by 450 .
PgOD1j2DhNg104,8.46,8.48,And a reduction by 650
,,,and then another increase in 250 .
PgOD1j2DhNg105,8.5,8.57,So what you can see is that the waterfall chart
,,,really enables you to breakdown
,,,something into the different sub component
,,,that were driving it .
PgOD1j2DhNg106,8.58,9,And then enable it to make change visible
,,,that were just not visible .
PgOD1j2DhNg107,9.03,9.05,Just looking at the total difference
,,,between two number .
PgOD1j2DhNg108,9.06,9.06,Let 's now look into another
,,,very ambiguous chart element .
PgOD1j2DhNg109,9.09,9.09,This is a so callout .
PgOD1j2DhNg110,9.12,9.12,This is this element right here .
PgOD1j2DhNg111,9.14,9.16,So this is an element that you can just
,,,include in a chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg112,9.18,9.18,Gives detail about this specific element .
PgOD1j2DhNg113,9.21,9.25,So a I wrote here it can include remark
,,,on specific element of a chart or other relevant
,,,contribution that you wan na make .
PgOD1j2DhNg114,9.27,9.31,A callout is something that you can easily use
,,,just add detail
,,,add information
,,,add context to one specific element .
PgOD1j2DhNg115,9.33,9.33,This is a frequent way how you can do it .
PgOD1j2DhNg116,9.36,9.38,So this element just consists of one line
,,,and then another line with a special ending .
PgOD1j2DhNg117,9.4,9.4,So if you ha never created this yourself .
PgOD1j2DhNg118,9.42,9.49,I just broke down here the element here
,,,you see the line and that this is just
,,,another line then it 's you can know in the line setting
,,,you can just add also such an endpoint to it .
PgOD1j2DhNg119,9.51,9.51,Then if you combine it this is what it look like .
PgOD1j2DhNg120,9.54,9.55,So this is just an easy way to create
,,,this kind of callout element .
PgOD1j2DhNg121,9.57,10.01,And believe it or not but callouts like this
,,,will be used in pretty much every single
,,,consulting presentation that you see .
PgOD1j2DhNg122,10.03,10.05,Another element that might have catched your
,,,attention is something that is called a sticker .
PgOD1j2DhNg123,10.07,10.07,And this is what you see here in the top right .
PgOD1j2DhNg124,10.09,10.12,So a sticker is a qualification of the
,,,page that you use .
PgOD1j2DhNg125,10.13,10.13,Here you see the preliminary sticker .
PgOD1j2DhNg126,10.15,10.18,So let 's now just go over some example of sticker
,,,that are frequently and commonly used .
PgOD1j2DhNg127,10.2,10.22,Then what the context is how you use them
,,,in the consulting context .
PgOD1j2DhNg128,10.24,10.28,So for discussion sticker
,,,the preliminary sticker
,,,highly preliminary indicative
,,,and then illustrative .
PgOD1j2DhNg129,10.31,10.33,So these are probably the five
,,,most commonly used sticker .
PgOD1j2DhNg130,10.35,10.35,Of course you could write other thing a well .
PgOD1j2DhNg131,10.37,10.39,And sticker are element that are
,,,pretty much used to protect yourself .
PgOD1j2DhNg132,10.41,10.5,So why could this be important ?
,,,Why would you need to protect yourself ?
,,,So let 's imagine you make an analysis
,,,which might be a bit controversial
,,,you know that their resides
,,,will not please everybody .
PgOD1j2DhNg133,10.52,11.01,And what you can do is
,,,to include such a for discussion sticker
,,,then if you walk into a meeting
,,,then you realize that your analysis spark
,,,some discussion and then yet you can say
,,,well  Yes of course this is not the final result . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg134,11.01,11.04, This is just for discussion . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg135,11.04,11.06,As you also wrote here .
PgOD1j2DhNg136,11.07,11.07, So let 's just have a discussion about it . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg137,11.07,11.08, I 'm interested to hear your opinion . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg138,11.08,11.15, What is your view of it ? ''
,,, Why do you believe this is true ? ''
,,, What is your opinion ? ''
,,,So this is how you frequently use
,,,such a for discussion sticker .
PgOD1j2DhNg139,11.17,11.25,Preliminary and highly preliminary
,,,this is just something to make clear
,,,that the result that you 're showing
,,,the analysis that you are doing
,,,are not the final one .
PgOD1j2DhNg140,11.27,11.32,And here again this just is a way to protect yourself
,,,that then if later it come out that
,,,maybe your were missing some data .
PgOD1j2DhNg141,11.34,11.35,That there additional information that you
,,,would need to take into consideration .
PgOD1j2DhNg142,11.37,11.4,You can just say  Yes of course this analysis that ''
,,, we did here wa only preliminary . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg143,11.4,11.43, This wa not the final version . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg144,11.43,11.58,This is also again to protect yourself
,,,because otherwise it could happen
,,,and these thing happen right ?
,,,That there is a hostile client
,,,that then just point out a page that you created
,,,maybe in the first week of your engagement
,,,that you were just learning
,,,trying to understand the data .
PgOD1j2DhNg145,12,12.05,And the page you labeled you just did wa complete BS
,,,because this analysis that you created
,,,wa just obviously not correct .
PgOD1j2DhNg146,12.07,12.1,Right ?
,,,And maybe he wa right maybe it just wa n't correct
,,,because you did n't have the full picture .
PgOD1j2DhNg147,12.12,12.18,But then you can say  Yes Mister this is true you are ''
,,, right but a you can also read here this wa not a final ''
,,, version of the analysis . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg148,12.18,12.19, This wa just a preliminary version . ''
PgOD1j2DhNg149,12.19,12.21,And incident like that happen .
PgOD1j2DhNg150,12.23,12.23,And this is why you put the preliminary sticker on it .
PgOD1j2DhNg151,12.25,12.27,That 's similar but different is the indicative sticker
,,,and also the illustrative sticker .
PgOD1j2DhNg152,12.29,12.35,So an indicative sticker you can use just to make
,,,it clear that a certain analysis that you make
,,,maybe ha some flaw
,,,maybe ha some drawback .
PgOD1j2DhNg153,12.37,12.38,So the number that you show
,,,should not be taken that serious .
PgOD1j2DhNg154,12.41,12.53,But it give a good direction
,,,so that you believe that the analysis
,,,the result that you show are at least are
,,,indicatively right
,,,and these show the right direction
,,,the right picture
,,,even thought the specific number that you use
,,,might not be accurate .
PgOD1j2DhNg155,12.54,12.54,And this of course can happen in any situation .
PgOD1j2DhNg156,12.56,13,You need to work with the incomplete data set
,,,where you 're lacking certain information
,,,that you just were not able to use .
PgOD1j2DhNg157,13.02,13.04,Then you might want to make it clear that the
,,,analysis that you 're showing is just indicative .
PgOD1j2DhNg158,13.06,13.06,Illustrative go kind of even further than indicative .
PgOD1j2DhNg159,13.1,13.2,And it 's sometimes also used a bit in a dirty way
,,,in the sense that you can show a whole chart of very
,,,specific information very specific graph
,,,then you can put an illustrative sticker on it .
PgOD1j2DhNg160,13.22,13.23,You can make it clear that actually
,,,the number are not true .
PgOD1j2DhNg161,13.25,13.29,That you just made up the whole chart right ?
,,,Maybe the whole chart doe n't contain
,,,any real number at all .
PgOD1j2DhNg162,13.32,13.36,But you just wanted to show a certain relationship
,,,how you believe that it is from your experience
,,,or maybe from other information that you have .
PgOD1j2DhNg163,13.38,13.48,So you 're just drawing this chart
,,,which maybe not even contains any real number at all
,,,but illustratively this is the chart you believe
,,,it look like .
PgOD1j2DhNg164,13.48,13.48,So this is how you put the illustrative sticker on it .
PgOD1j2DhNg165,13.51,13.56,So if you see the illustrative sticker on a presentation
,,,pretty frequently you can assume that actually
,,,the number are not real .
PgOD1j2DhNg166,13.57,13.57,The number are not actual number .
PgOD1j2DhNg167,13.59,14.01,But this chart pretty much just wa made up
,,,by the consultant who used it .
PgOD1j2DhNg168,14.03,14.06,So now another element that you can frequently use
,,,is something that is called a takeaway box .
PgOD1j2DhNg169,14.09,14.11,So takeaway box are something
,,,like this that you include below your chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg170,14.14,14.14,It includes an important overall remark .
PgOD1j2DhNg171,14.16,14.21,So while the callout you saw earlier
,,,usually is used for just given information on
,,,a specific element of the chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg172,14.23,14.28,If you ever have genuine information
,,,that is relevant to the whole chart
,,,you can just include such a takeaway box
,,,below the chart that you are showing .
PgOD1j2DhNg173,14.3,14.38,In the takeaway box you can just include the main insight
,,,the main piece of information
,,,that you want the reader the viewer the listener
,,,to takeaway from the chart that you are showing .
PgOD1j2DhNg174,14.41,14.44,Another element that you can use that look similar
,,,but is often used in a slightly different way .
PgOD1j2DhNg175,14.45,14.45,It is something that you would call a bubble .
PgOD1j2DhNg176,14.48,14.56,So bubble is sometimes also called a sticker
,,,and it 's included in a chart in some way like that
,,,so you purposely make it look like this
,,,just included in front of something else .
PgOD1j2DhNg177,14.59,15.01,It look a bit le informal than for instance
,,,a takeaway box .
PgOD1j2DhNg178,15.02,15.07,And a bubble you often use to include
,,,some kind of limitation
,,,to the analysis that you are showing a
,,,limitation to the data that you are showing .
PgOD1j2DhNg179,15.09,15.15,And a bubble is called a bubble
,,,because sometimes instead of a rectangular form
,,,you can also use a circular form of the text that
,,,you are showing .
PgOD1j2DhNg180,15.16,15.19,So that the text is included in a circle
,,,instead of a rectangular form .
PgOD1j2DhNg181,15.2,15.24,From the standpoint bubble are so important
,,,you need to put yourself into the shoe
,,,of a consultant .
PgOD1j2DhNg182,15.25,15.29,Because very frequently you receive certain data set
,,,certain information from your client .
PgOD1j2DhNg183,15.31,15.35,And then you take several day
,,,or maybe even week to then conduct the analysis
,,,and then to come up with some kind of a result .
PgOD1j2DhNg184,15.37,15.56,Then very often what happens is that then
,,,the last day some anxious hour before
,,,the big presentation
,,,where you then want to show the result
,,,you receive some new information
,,,maybe you realize that now some new data came out
,,,maybe now the next month 's finished
,,,and now you put re all the analysis
,,,with all the data from the new time period
,,,from the new month .
PgOD1j2DhNg185,15.57,16.14,In these situation you 're very frequently faced with
,,,the decision to whether you want to re now
,,,all the analysis
,,,to incorporate this new information or whether
,,,will you leave all the analysis as ?
,,,And then just include a bubble on the page
,,,stating the limitation or stating what ha not
,,,yet been included in the analysis .
PgOD1j2DhNg186,16.17,16.22,Bubbles are so important because very frequently
,,,instead of re the whole thing re analysis
,,,re all kind of page .
PgOD1j2DhNg187,16.24,16.24,Problems like that you can frequently use with the bubble .
PgOD1j2DhNg188,16.27,16.36,And this is why there is a magic saying in consulting
,,,and this go like  If in trouble use a bubble ! ''
,,,So if you are struggling with something
,,,something just is n't right .
PgOD1j2DhNg189,16.38,16.43,You just need to use this statement
,,,just need to make some correction
,,,in the end if you 're in trouble
,,,most of the problem you can just use with a bubble .
PgOD1j2DhNg190,16.46,16.46,Just stating the specific thing that you want to change .
PgOD1j2DhNg191,16.49,16.51,Now some other frequently used element
,,,are circle with number .
PgOD1j2DhNg192,16.54,17.03,This again is something that I very frequently
,,,see in consulting presentation
,,,but I rarely see line of circle with number like that in
,,,presentation that are being done by non people .
PgOD1j2DhNg193,17.05,17.05,So how do you use these thing .
PgOD1j2DhNg194,17.08,17.11,So you can use these kind of number circle whenever
,,,you want to include another layer of data .
PgOD1j2DhNg195,17.14,17.16,Another dimension of number
,,,which is not directly part of the chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg196,17.19,17.19,So let 's look at this stylized chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg197,17.21,17.22,So what do we see here ?
,,,So these are the revenue figure of a business .
PgOD1j2DhNg198,17.24,17.26,But not the absolute figure
,,,but the difference to the previous year .
PgOD1j2DhNg199,17.29,17.33,So we look into these calendar week
,,,and we look into how the business performed
,,,against the previous year .
PgOD1j2DhNg200,17.34,17.41,So here so this would mean that in the calendar
,,,week seven of the year
,,,the business had revenue that were by a 100 million higher
,,,than in the previous year .
PgOD1j2DhNg201,17.43,17.46,You have 200 million higher 250 million higher
,,,here a 100 million le and so on .
PgOD1j2DhNg202,17.49,17.55,Of course in this context if you look at this
,,,it would be interesting and important to u
,,,to include what the absolute amount
,,,what the revenue wa in the current year 2020 .
PgOD1j2DhNg203,17.58,18.04,In situation like that where you just want to include a
,,,a second point of data second point of information
,,,circle of number like that are just very commonly used .
PgOD1j2DhNg204,18.08,18.18,So here you would now include information
,,,that in the calendar week seven
,,,you make now the revenue of 900 million
,,,and this wa 100 million more
,,,than you made in the previous year .
PgOD1j2DhNg205,18.2,18.27,Then regarding the legend what you do is
,,,the main legend that you state in the chart title
,,,the main legend always refers to the
,,,number in the main chart .
PgOD1j2DhNg206,18.29,18.32,And for the circle you can include a sub
,,,then explain what is shown and depicted in these circle .
PgOD1j2DhNg207,18.36,18.39,And if you 're interested to learn more about how to set up
,,,consulting style chart like that .
PgOD1j2DhNg208,18.41,18.46,I created a whole other video just discussing
,,,how you should set up the chart title
,,,then also the subtitle and thing like that .
PgOD1j2DhNg209,18.48,18.56,So if you have n't seen that yet
,,,I believe this is also highly relevant
,,,and something that you need to know
,,,if you work in consulting
,,,or want to create presentation that meet the
,,,standard of consulting firm .
PgOD1j2DhNg210,18.58,19,I will leave it above here for you
,,,check it out if you 'd like to see it a well .
PgOD1j2DhNg211,19.02,19.05,Next concept I would like to talk about is also a
,,,very very important one .
PgOD1j2DhNg212,19.07,19.07,And it 's the concept of clothesline .
PgOD1j2DhNg213,19.09,19.09,More specifically of avoiding clothesline .
PgOD1j2DhNg214,19.13,19.25,So what do we call clothesline in consulting ?
,,,Clotheslines are referred to a just long list of thing
,,,and specifically in the context
,,,of creating PowerPoint presentation
,,,just long list of bullet .
PgOD1j2DhNg215,19.27,19.36,So what you will always never see in
,,,consulting style presentation
,,,is just the list of bullet like that
,,,where you just randomly list all kind of thought
,,,or other explanation that you want to .
PgOD1j2DhNg216,19.38,19.45,So why is this bad ?
,,,So if you just use a list of thought like this
,,,what you 're missing what you 're not showing
,,,what you 're not doing is giving it some kind of structure .
PgOD1j2DhNg217,19.49,19.5,If you present thing like that
,,,it look completely random .
PgOD1j2DhNg218,19.53,20,The person looking at it
,,,can have no trust at all that actually the thing
,,,that are mentioned here are complete
,,,that all the relevant aspect
,,,have been discussed and addressed by you .
PgOD1j2DhNg219,20.02,20.04,But it just seems like a completely random
,,,unstructured list of point .
PgOD1j2DhNg220,20.07,20.09,In such an unstructured list of point
,,,is what you would call a clothesline .
PgOD1j2DhNg221,20.11,20.11,And you want to avoid clothesline .
PgOD1j2DhNg222,20.13,20.19,So what is now used in consulting to avoid
,,,clothesline like that ?
,,,And very frequently
,,,what you do is to use structure element .
PgOD1j2DhNg223,20.21,20.27,So here again just in the illustrative page
,,,this could be out of for instance an M & A transaction
,,,a merger 's and acquisition transaction .
PgOD1j2DhNg224,20.28,20.28,Where one company aim to buy another company .
PgOD1j2DhNg225,20.31,20.4,Another company is showing how the purchasing price
,,,that they want to offer for a company split down
,,,to the different asset that the company ha
,,,and that the company is selling .
PgOD1j2DhNg226,20.42,20.45,Here again this is now
,,,another frequent use of a waterfall chart
,,,that you now have the total purchasing price .
PgOD1j2DhNg227,20.47,20.51,Now you show how this break down into the different
,,,subelements of the company .
PgOD1j2DhNg228,20.53,20.55,Now here you have the different asset that the company
,,,ha to offer u so here property plant and equipment .
PgOD1j2DhNg229,20.58,21.02,Then of course there could be a whole lot of other
,,,asset that the company offer
,,,for instance inventory and so on .
PgOD1j2DhNg230,21.04,21.07,Now a clothesline would be just to state all these asset
,,,just in a random list of bullet .
PgOD1j2DhNg231,21.09,21.11,Now to avoid clothesline
,,,what you often use is structure element .
PgOD1j2DhNg232,21.14,21.23,So what you try is to define bucket
,,,to define group of element
,,,then you can use to organize the different subelements
,,,that are from bullet point that you have .
PgOD1j2DhNg233,21.25,21.33,Now here just a simple example is to use gray bar
,,,that you include in front of the element
,,,then the company you will often distinguish the
,,,fixed asset from the current asset .
PgOD1j2DhNg234,21.36,21.39,This is now a structure that I defined
,,,in that in this structure
,,,now I can use a different bullet point .
PgOD1j2DhNg235,21.42,21.44,And I hope you now understand that this is superior
,,,to other way of structuring the point .
PgOD1j2DhNg236,21.45,21.56,Because now by having to use the structure
,,,fixed asset and current asset
,,,I already have some kind of guarantee
,,,that if I now look at these two type of asset
,,,I will catch all the asset
,,,that are included in the company .
PgOD1j2DhNg237,21.59,22.01,Because this way now I have covered
,,,the whole balance sheet of the company .
PgOD1j2DhNg238,22.02,22.06,And I can be sure that I will have covered all
,,,the asset within these two group .
PgOD1j2DhNg239,22.08,22.13,So always use structure element
,,,avoid at all cost using clothesline
,,,because this is just completely unprofessional .
PgOD1j2DhNg240,22.14,22.17,This is probably one of the first point of feedback
,,,that you will get a a young consultant .
PgOD1j2DhNg241,22.19,22.21,If you created a page just using
,,,a list of bullet point like this .
PgOD1j2DhNg242,22.22,22.27,So this concludes my little list of tip and trick
,,,of element that you can use to
,,,improve your PowerPoint page a well .
PgOD1j2DhNg243,22.29,22.29,I hope you found this wa useful .
PgOD1j2DhNg244,22.31,22.35,If you have any question about that
,,,feel free to leave me a comment below
,,,in the comment section .
PgOD1j2DhNg245,22.36,22.47,I will answer every single comment
,,,and I also like to hear from you
,,,what are your little tip ?
,,,What are the thing that you 've frequently use
,,,to improve your presentation ?
,,,Let 's have a conversation here from which
,,,everybody can benefit .

Hp7Id3Yb9XQ1,0,0.08,You 're probably tuning into this talk because you 're interested in improving your speaking skill and you know let 's face it none of u really have had a lot of explicit training
,,,in presentation a scientist . So ok we 're not expert . We may not be expert at public speaking
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ2,0.08,0.08,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ3,0.08,0.16,but I would actually suggest to you that we are all expert at listening to talk . Think about the number of hour that each of u ha sat in a chair in a lecture room
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ4,0.16,0.33,in a seminar in an auditorium listened to journal club to all kind of talk
,,,we 've spent hour and hour and hour listening to talk . So we 're expert at knowing what a good talk is because we know what we want delivered a an audience member .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ5,0.33,0.33,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ6,0.44,0.44,So if you think about it why do we go to a talk ? Well we 're interested obviously in learning some about interesting and novel science .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ7,0.52,0.58,We are going to listen to speaker who we think are credible and knowledgeable
,,,and doing novel work . We are responsive to speaker who are enthusiastic and who just keep u awake
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ8,0.58,1.23,and we want a talk that is well organized clear a talk that we can follow a talk that 's not laden down with jargon
,,,and a talk that give u enough background to understand what 's going on we want to be able to see the data understand it interpret it
,,,and then make our own decision about the science . So we 're all expert at listening to talk why ca n't we just translate what we know
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ9,1.23,1.31,we want a an audience member into how we give a talk a individual .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ10,1.37,1.37,Let 's think about something ; how many time have we each seen a slide like this . We 've seen it a zillion time right we 're sitting there in a chair
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ11,1.37,1.46,listening to a seminar a slide like this come on . And we have no idea of what to look at .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ12,1.46,1.46,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ13,1.52,1.58,Are we supposed to read all of this text ? Are we supposed to look at this figure or that figure
,,,or that figure ? We 're overwhelmed visually and we 've all seen this slide a thousand time . Now I just want to make a quick disclaimer .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ14,1.58,1.58,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ15,2.05,2.12,This wa not my work and I 'm not suggesting for a second that the author of this really gorgeous paper
,,,would have shown a slide like that . But if I were giving a journal club on that topic I might have produced a slide like this for you
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ16,2.12,2.19,in trying to tell you about these data . So when we think about what we know instinctively is just a disaster why do we keep doing it
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ17,2.19,2.39,again and again and again ? I think that we need to know some basic rule about power point
,,,and how to structure a talk in order to enable these visuals to work effectively
,,,a we 're teaching a we 're speaking about our own science a we 're presenting journal club .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ18,2.45,3,So what I 'm going to do is first of all go through some basic about power point and then we 're going to think about how you structure a talk
,,,in order to lead a member of the audience through the data in a way that they will understand each piece that you 're presenting and
,,,be able to really understand what the take message is . First of all what font should you use ?
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ19,3,3.06,It turn out that some of the default font in power point and keynote are exactly wrong . The font you should use is a Sans Serif font .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ20,3.06,3.06,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ21,3.14,3.2,What is a Sans Serif font ? San Serif font are font without little doober line
,,,and stuff at the bottom of letter . And that 's to be contrasted with Serif font which have all the little doober at the bottom of each letter .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ22,3.2,3.2,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ23,3.28,3.39,So why do you use one and not the other ? Well visual psychophysicist have discovered that using a Sans Serif font when you 're projecting text
,,,onto a screen like this make it easier for the audience to read the text quickly . These font down here the Serif font this is the font if you have novel you were going to read it in bed
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ24,3.39,3.5,it 's very easy to read . And that 's why book are printed with Serif font but you should choose and there are a range of choice that you can make
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ25,3.5,3.59,one of the Sans Serif font for your scientific presentation . How big should your font be ?
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ26,3.59,4.04,Again be careful of some of the default font size . One of the default in Power Point is astronomically huge
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ27,4.04,4.11,bigger than this one right here it 's like 42 . It 's way too big ! You do n't need that . So the range of font size that you should use are shown here .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ28,4.11,4.11,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ29,4.11,4.11,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ30,4.19,4.19,Anywhere from 18 down to 36 with one exception . We often in our scientific presentation will want to insert a reference to a published paper
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ31,4.19,4.28,which is n't really the focus of the slide but we want to have it up there for scientific accuracy .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ32,4.34,4.34,So under those circumstance you might use a 14 point font to put your reference at the bottom of the slide .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ33,4.42,4.42,Other than that just work in this range and you 'll be good . Avoid using capital letter . This make it clear why .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ34,4.42,4.42,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ35,4.42,4.42,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ36,4.49,4.49,It 's actually really hard to read all capitol . And secondly in this age of email I think we all know that capitalizing everything
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ37,4.49,4.57,is the visual equivalent of shouting at someone . So it 's just not polite . In addition when you 're thinking about title
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ38,4.57,4.57,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ39,4.57,5.04,or how you would actually capitalize word use a sentence format . In other word do n't capitalize every word
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ40,5.04,5.11,of your title or your text down here . Having capital of every word slows down the eye and make it difficult to read .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ41,5.11,5.11,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ42,5.2,5.26,So remember the text and the slide is really there for the audience to be able to read quickly
,,,and easily . Color scheme are really important and thinking about the background of your slide .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ43,5.26,5.26,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ44,5.33,5.4,Now we 've all seen a lot of slide that have very fancy background and in fact
,,,you want the simplest possible background . For example a plain white background with dark letter
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ45,5.4,5.45,either black or blue . That work very well ; it 's high in contrast
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ46,5.45,5.51,and the only thing that appears on the slide is the information that your audience need to understand this slide in the context of your talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ47,5.59,5.59,Avoid using the fancy patterned background .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ48,6.05,6.05,You do n't need your company or university logo on every slide . You do not need a DNA double helix
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ49,6.05,6.11,running down every slide . All of that is extraneous . Maybe it might appear on your first slide but then get rid of it .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ50,6.11,6.11,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ51,6.11,6.11,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ52,6.18,6.18,Streamline it down to a simple a possible and think about the contrast of letter .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ53,6.24,6.24,So dark against light work really well light against dark work very well . A black background with white letter
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ54,6.24,6.3,or bright yellow . Again high contrast easy for the audience to read . When should you use which ? Well if you were to give a talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ55,6.3,6.3,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ56,6.3,6.49,for example at a very large symposium with hundred of people a very big room psycophysically and in term of the projector
,,,the contrast is greatest if you use a dark background and light letter under that context .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ57,6.55,6.55,So it 's easier to project at high contrast . If you 're teaching in a small room or you 're in a circumstance where you 're worried about people staying awake
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ58,6.55,7.07,then I would use a white background with dark letter . That is actually more effective .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ59,7.07,7.07,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ60,7.13,7.13,However you do want to think about your science . For example in my science I use a lot of fluorescence photomicrograph where I actually prefer a dark background
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ61,7.13,7.25,because the contrast I want people to be dark adapted so they can really see my data .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ62,7.3,7.3,So in one of my scientific seminar regardless of whether I 'm in a small room or a big room I use a black background .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ63,7.36,7.36,It just work better for my science . There are certain color combination that you should avoid . Red/green is bad :
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ64,7.36,7.36,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ65,7.36,7.44,this is incredibly difficult to look at . In addition a large fraction of the population is red color blind
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ66,7.44,7.51,and finally red is really angry color . I actually saw an entire seminar once with the background color of the slide that wa red and
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ67,7.51,8.01,I wa so agitated by ten minute into the talk so avoid that . Other color combination can be equally bad
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ68,8.01,8.16,and this is bad not because the color are unpleasant but because the contrast here is not big enough
,,,for an audience member to actually read the letter against this background . This is important because in science we 're often
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ69,8.16,8.3,creating for example these cartoon of for example of a signal transduction pathway
,,,where you want each protein to be a different color . So we 're always looking for a new color for a new protein a we 're going through
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ70,8.3,8.43,a flow of talk but we want to make sure that each protein that might in fact be this blue color
,,,would then have a label on top of it that 's high contrast . For example for this it might be black instead of green .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ71,8.43,8.43,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ72,8.49,8.49,Let 's think now about how to lay out a slide visually in Power Point so that it 's really easy for an audience member to follow the content of your talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ73,8.59,9.08,First of all I strongly recommend that every slide a heading at the top and the best heading is actually a statement a simple sentence
,,,that say in plain english what the bottom line of the slide is . Now you might say Sue excuse me this is not a statement and you 're right
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ74,9.08,9.22,ok busted this is really going through an outline for this particular talk but in my science talk
,,,every slide is headed by a statement . If you 're going to include text in a slide it 's very important to just limit the amount of text .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ75,9.22,9.22,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ76,9.32,9.38,I really strongly urge you to use no more than two line of text
,,,in a text block . Why is that ? The minute you show a big block of text like this I have lost you a an audience member .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ77,9.38,9.38,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ78,9.45,9.45,You do n't know at this point whether you should be reading all of this stuff or listening to me .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ79,9.51,9.56,And if you a an audience member are now distracted and confused about what you should be doing
,,,I a a speaker have lost control of my talk . So do n't use thing like this there 's one exception there might be a wonderful quotation that you want to include in your talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ80,9.56,9.56,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ81,10.07,10.15,For example a quote from The Double Helix or a quote from the beautiful writing of Ramon y Cajal
,,,if you 're a neurobiologist . And under those circumstance it 's great to include the full text . What I recommend you do if you do include a quotation is rather than read it word by word
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ82,10.15,10.15,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ83,10.15,10.25,instead sort of paraphrase it a you 're going along . You might say well the reason for limiting block of text to just two line is
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ84,10.25,10.32,if it go on forever people in the audience are going to have to make this huge effort to read it and that will preclude them from paying attention to what you 're saying .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ85,10.4,10.4,So you can paraphrase a quote that 's very effective unless it is very poetic and you want to do a dramatic reading and that 's fine too .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ86,10.47,10.47,Lists should be short ; try to limit your list to just three item .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ87,10.54,11.02,Avoid like mad long list and if you 're going to have a list I strongly recommend that you use the animation feature in PowerPoint
,,,to unveil your list one at a time . So when you 're talking about item one in your talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ88,11.02,11.07,that will appear . And only when you 're ready to talk about item two
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ89,11.07,11.12,doe that second item appear and likewise when you 're ready to include item three that will come up a well .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ90,11.18,11.18,Be very generous in a slide with empty space . It 's more effective it 's more powerful for the audience .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ91,11.18,11.18,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ92,11.26,11.26,And this is why . If you start to just load your slide with stuff it 's visually overwhelming and often you can get into a situation
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ93,11.26,11.41,we 've all been in seminar before where something is very very very close to the edge of the slide
,,,and there 's a slight misalignment between the projector and the screen that then result in stuff getting cut off .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ94,11.49,11.49,And we 've all been at talk where someone say `` oh I 'm sorry If you could have seen the slide then you would have been able to read it . ''
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ95,11.49,11.55,Well just leaving some space at the different edge the boundary of the slide and do n't forget about leaving some space at the bottom .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ96,12.03,12.11,If you 're in a room where everyone is sitting at the same level people in the back are trying to see over one another 's head
,,,so if you 're stuff is too close to bottom some people in the back ca n't see it . So leave space on all three side and a little space at the top again for the misalignment problem .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ97,12.11,12.11,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ98,12.19,12.19,Ok let 's think about the style of these slide . I urge you
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ99,12.19,12.31,most wholeheartedly to include a simple image
,,,on every slide . What most slide ? No every slide . In every slide of one of my scientific presentation there is an image .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ100,12.31,12.31,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ101,12.31,12.31,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ102,12.4,12.4,Why is that ? Here 's the deal . We audience member who are listening to a talk take in and process information
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ103,12.4,12.48,in quite different way from one another . Some of u are reader and that 's the reason for having a sentence at the top of each slide .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ104,12.48,12.48,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ105,12.57,12.57,Some of u are going to take in information by reading . Others of u are very visual . If we have an image on the slide
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ106,12.57,12.57,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ107,12.57,13.04,then that appeal to the vision we 're primate we 're very visually oriented so we communicate through picture .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ108,13.1,13.1,And the third way we talk in information is by listening . The ideal the perfect power point slide represents an absolutely
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ109,13.1,13.2,synchronous match between a simple statement at the top a simple visual and what you a a speaker are saying .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ110,13.3,13.3,So that the same content is being delivered through all three channel at the same time without any distraction .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ111,13.38,13.44,Make your slide simple limit the number of stuff you included in each slide
,,,and just make one or two point from each slide . Now we 've all heard this rule maybe most of u have heard a rule
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ112,13.44,13.58,how many slide should you show in a particular scientific presentation ? And the rule that I learned and the rule that perhaps you learned a well
,,,the rule is you show one slide per minute . So if you 're giving a twenty minute talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ113,13.58,14.03,you show twenty slide . I would argue now that that might have been true when slide were actually on film
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ114,14.03,14.12,and difficult to manipulate and there wa no such thing a animation . Now that we have tool like PowerPoint and Keynote
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ115,14.12,14.24,that enable u to build content progressively in slide and to have thing that are simple
,,,simple point that we can easily change from talk to talk that rule doe n't really hold anymore .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ116,14.31,14.31,And I do n't think there is a firm rule I think it really depends on the amount of information that you 're delivering in a talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ117,14.37,14.48,So make your slide simple do n't worry about this one slide per minute rule and rather get feedback from a you practice a talk
,,,get feedback from your colleague about whether you 're overwhelming people with too much data and number of slide .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ118,14.54,14.54,If your slide are simple you can show more than one per minute . We have all seen talk where a slide like this come up
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ119,14.54,15.08,and what doe the speaker do ? The speaker doe this the speaker say `` I know this slide is really busy but the only thing I really want you to look at
,,,is this set of data right here '' . We 've been there right ? I 've been there you 've been there .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ120,15.08,15.08,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ121,15.14,15.2,What ha the speaker just told you ? The speaker 's just said I 'm too lazy to have created a slide
,,,that is actually tailored for what I want to show you . And we a audience member are looking at all of this stuff
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ122,15.2,15.46,we even if we 're told to look at this I mean how many of u behave ? I personally I 'm looking this and I 'm wondering about that
,,,so the speaker ha not only shown a little bit of disrespect and laziness to u in my opinion
,,,but in addition the speaker ha lost u a audience member because we 're now wandering around the slide
,,,and wondering we 're having our own thought . So if you 're going to show a slide like this simply take the data that
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ123,15.46,15.53,you want to show eliminate everything else and put that up . And then explain the data completely .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ124,15.53,15.53,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ125,16.01,16.01,Explain to the audience what the ax are what each color is and remember that this is the very first time that anyone in the audience ha seen this particular graph .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ126,16.12,16.12,You 've seen it a thousand time you get it intuitively like that but they wo n't . So just show the data that you want to explain
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ127,16.12,16.19,and explain the data that you show . In other word here 's the simple rule : if you 're not going to take the time to explain it get rid of it completely .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ128,16.19,16.19,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ129,16.28,16.28,It doe n't belong there . I want to show you an example of a figure that I used to show in one of my scientific presentation .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ130,16.28,16.28,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ131,16.35,16.35,And it 's a brain and it 's got some protein and it show the distribution of those protein in the brain .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ132,16.41,16.41,It 's a pretty simple figure the content doe n't matter to u . But I want to show you what this figure looked like before I put it into the talk in this format .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ133,16.41,16.41,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ134,16.51,16.51,Here 's what the figure looked like in the actual paper that I took it from .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ135,16.56,17.12,It had all of these extra label that were extraneous I wa never going to explain that MGE stand for the medial ganglionic eminence because it 's not relevant to the talk
,,,so what did I do ? I took this figure I put it into Photoshop and I got rid of all of that
,,,leaving only a little landmark the eye to orient the audience to what we were saying .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ136,17.17,17.22,So you can take complex figure export them and simply them
,,,in order to fit perfectly with your presentation . We have all seen a lot of especially with the introduction of Keynote
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ137,17.22,17.33,some very fancy transition between slide . What do me mean by transition ? Well
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ138,17.33,17.39,in my talk so far when I 've advanced the slide you simply see the new slide . Remember when Keynote came out and the first time you were at a talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ139,17.39,18.04,and the speaker advanced to the next slide and the slide formed a box and the box rotated in 3 dimension and then a new slide appeared
,,,and you thought `` Oh that 's really cool that wa wild ! '' and then the speaker got their advance and they advanced to the second slide and
,,,the slide then did a big spiral and then the new slide appeared and by the third or fourth time that the speaker did that you felt nauseated .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ140,18.13,18.13,We yeah so avoid these fancy transition they are not in service of the talk . There is an exception though .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ141,18.13,18.13,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ142,18.21,18.21,There are some transition that actually illustrate in a very subtle way action . Here 's an example . This is a slide that I 've shown in some of my presentation
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ143,18.21,18.21,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ144,18.21,18.3,that have talked about the migration of neuron in the developing brain . And in this particular talk the point I wanted to make wa that we would take out neuron
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ145,18.3,18.4,from a very small region and culture them . So I used a very simple wipe transition . Watch this it 's subtle but there 's the transition .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ146,18.4,18.4,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ147,18.4,18.4,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ148,18.49,18.49,It actually wipe from one side to the other . That sort of mimic the act of taking something out of the brain and putting it into culture .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ149,18.49,18.49,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ150,18.55,19,So that 's a sensible use another sensible use would be if you 're going to zoom in on something
,,,if you 're going to zoom in on this region you might use a zoom transition . Apart from that just advance from one slide to the next with a simple transition .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ151,19,19,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ152,19.09,19.09,Do n't drown the audience with data .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ153,19.15,19.33,What make a talk memorable is when a speaker communicates
,,,a couple of take message in a way that present just enough data
,,,to be convincing but not so much data that the audience is just flooded with information
,,,and ca n't process it . Less is more and here 's a way to think about it . Those of u who are biologist
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ154,19.33,19.33,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ155,19.33,19.41,are used to culturing cell in minimum essential medium . Just enough of the critical nutrient and element and vitamin
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ156,19.41,19.55,that a cell need to survive and nothing extra . Minimum essential medium . Now if you take out any one of those element in the medium
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ157,19.55,19.55,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ158,19.55,20.05,the cell will die . Adding more doe n't add any value to your culture .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ159,20.05,20.05,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ160,20.11,20.17,So if we think about minimum essential medium we can also think about
,,,minimum essential data . Just the data that you need to convince the audience of the credibility of your science and no more .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ161,20.17,20.17,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ162,20.25,20.32,That 's really difficult and I think that 's the most difficult decision that we have to make
,,,in term of presenting a seminar . What is just enough ? And where 's the line between just enough and not too much .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ163,20.32,20.32,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ164,20.39,20.54,For that experience help a lot but also getting feedback from your colleague when you 're practicing your talk to ask people can I get rid of this ? What can go ?
,,,Do n't ask what can I add ask what can go ? To make this convincing and thorough
,,,and yet not too much . So I think we all realize it 's really easy to use PowerPoint badly
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ165,20.54,21.12,right ? So we 've seen a zillion example like this of people presenting journal club or seminar
,,,you see a slide like that we a audience member are visually overwhelmed we 're lost we do n't know what to look at
,,,we ca n't read this stuff it 's too much to read we 're distracted . The minute a slide like this go up the speaker ha lost the audience completely .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ166,21.12,21.12,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ167,21.2,21.37,So it take a lot of work do n't get me wrong it take time to use PowerPoint or Keynote effectively in a seminar because you have to think carefully
,,,about what you need to present what you NEED to present not what you want to present not what you 'd love to present but what you need to present
,,,and to present it using clear simple graphic and clear simple text . So in fact let 's go through an exercise .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ168,21.37,21.37,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ169,21.47,21.47,Let 's take that previous slide from this lovely paper from JCB which I actually presented for a journal club many year ago .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ170,21.54,21.54,Let 's take that previous slide which is figure 2 from that paper and let 's see how we can break it down into it minimum essential component .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ171,22.02,22.02,The first decision that we have to make in term of looking at all the data in this figure is what stay and what go . What 's the minimum essential data ?
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ172,22.02,22.1,What are excuse my grammatical error there what are the minimum essential data ? that we need in order to present in our journal club .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ173,22.17,22.17,And we might decide at that point that this particular part of the figure panel b can go . It 's not essential but everything else is .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ174,22.17,22.17,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ175,22.24,22.24,So how do we present that ? Well let 's deploy our PowerPoint rule in this context . First of all I 'm going show you how I 'd present panel a . Look at it for a second
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ176,22.24,22.24,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ177,22.24,22.33,it 's got some result in a gel and it 's got some image of cell . How might I do that ? Well
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ178,22.33,22.39,here 's the first figure here 's the first slide in presenting this figure . Notice that there 's a sentence at the top and then I 've taken the data
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ179,22.39,22.49,from the figure and I 've added some stuff over here . I 've added two label that help the audience
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ180,22.49,22.54,understand immediately that this is a PCR product and this is actually a Western blot .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ181,22.59,22.59,So I 've added some stuff to be helpful to the audience but I 've simplified their focus so there 's a good match between showing this and having the text .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ182,23.07,23.07,And what I would be saying if I were actually presenting a journal club . And then using a simple animation
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ183,23.07,23.13,I would then unveil the rest of this panel . And I 've added something for this audience down here
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ184,23.13,23.19,showing you that this is actually a photomicrograph of MDCK cell .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ185,23.25,23.25,So that 's panel a presented in really two part using a simple animation and some addition . The next thing I might want to show actually come from panel c
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ186,23.25,23.34,of that figure . And I 've added a bunch of stuff here to be audience friendly . First of all notice that there 's a sentence at the top a statement of what 's going on .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ187,23.34,23.34,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ188,23.34,23.34,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ189,23.44,23.5,I 'm showing just one simple panel I 've added a label and I 've added this statement to help the audience that
,,,we 're looking down at the surface of these cell . from the lumen . I 've also added some color coding so that they know what protein are visualized
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ190,23.5,23.5,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ191,23.5,24,in different color . That wa n't in the original figure I added that because who is this slide for ? It 's for the audience .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ192,24,24,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ193,24.06,24.06,The audience need this . And then using an animation we 'll then show a side view of the same cell that ' s the control cell . Now watch what happens .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ194,24.06,24.06,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ195,24.06,24.06,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ196,24.14,24.21,Two thing happen ; the sentence at the top change cause there 's a new message and we 've added the contrasting view
,,,of the cell that have this particular protein knocked down . Let 's now think about the last part a new sentence that really state that
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ197,24.21,24.3,this protein is essential for these cell to form little microvilli and in the absence of protein they do n't .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ198,24.37,24.44,So now we 've presented that complicated figure in a few part using some simple animation
,,,in a very audience format . So what 's the bottom line with PowerPoint ? Make simple slide simple slide that make one or two point .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ199,24.44,24.44,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ200,24.52,24.52,Build your content progressively using animation rather than present everything all at once .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ201,24.58,24.58,Just show one PowerPoint and Keynote they 're all about control . They 're controlling what people see what you 're saying and what they 're reading
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ202,24.58,25.08,and have all those match at the same time . And remember if you 're not going to talk about it just leave it out .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ203,25.08,25.08,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ204,25.15,25.15,If you 're not going to explain it it doe n't belong there at all . It go . Ok that 's what I wanted to tell you about PowerPoint I hope that 's helpful .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ205,25.15,25.15,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ206,25.15,25.15,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ207,25.24,25.24,And now we want to transition into thinking more broadly about how to structure a talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ208,25.31,25.31,So that it organization is clear to the audience . And I think about it a almost taking someone by the hand
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ209,25.31,25.42,and walking them through the science right and saying here 's what I want you to see now
,,,and here 's the path that we 're following here 's where we 've just been and here 's where we 're going . So a good talk is like a good paper it ha a structure
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ210,25.42,25.57,right a good talk start out with a big question and then we build content over time we go through the meat of the talk
,,,and then we end with a conclusion that basically reach back out to the big issue that we started with .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ211,26.02,26.02,Same way a we write a paper why are so bad at actually doing this at talk ? Well if we discipline ourselves to do it I think we can do it better .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ212,26.1,26.25,I 'd like to show you an example from one of my own seminar of how I actually structure an introduction to define the really big question
,,,and then give enough background information to enable the audience to be able to follow the meat of the talk
,,,in the middle . And a I 'm doing that I also want to show you a trick that I 've learned
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ213,26.25,26.31,that I think is extraordinarily effective at giving good talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ214,26.36,26.36,And that 's an idea that I call something like a home slide or a home image . It 's a picture
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ215,26.36,26.5,maybe a cartoon an image of some sort that is going to signal to the audience
,,,that you 're at a point in the talk where you 're going to make a transition . It 's a little signal to the audience to perk up because you 're going to tell them where you 've just been
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ216,26.5,26.59,what it mean and where you 're going next . So a I show you the introduction to one of my talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ217,26.59,27.09,I 'm going to build up into a home slide that you 'll see a little bit later
,,,is going to come up again and again and again at transition . You might feel a little bit jarred because now the background of the slide is going to change from white to black
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ218,27.09,27.16,and this jarred feeling that you might experience is one of the reason that I think it 's actually quite important in a talk to keep the same color background throughout the entire thing .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ219,27.25,27.25,So here we go . So here 's the first slide from my standard seminar and notice first of all that my name and institution appear right here .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ220,27.25,27.25,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ221,27.32,27.39,Why is that ? Well because people in the audience may be taking note and they might want to write down your name and they 'll want to know how to spell it correctly
,,,so it 's a courtesy to them . So a I start in my talk I start to discus
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ222,27.39,27.55,a kind of analogy between the brain which is what we study and a computer chip because each of them ha to make really specific connection with one another
,,,the brain during development and the computer chip in a factory . And I make kind of a joke and see if people laugh and gauge the humor level of my audience at that point .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ223,27.55,27.55,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ224,28.03,28.22,And then I show the audience the cell that I actually work on the actual circuitry of the brain
,,,that my lab study in the cerebral cortex and then I frame the major question that my lab is interested in
,,,which really ha to do with the question of how it is that these individual neuron in the brain know
,,,what kind of connection to form what are the molecular mechanism that guide those choice about cell fate and connectivity .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ225,28.29,28.42,At this point then I introduce the two cell type that the talk will focus on
,,,two set of neuron that you 'll see have different color and then I introduce two question that the talk will address
,,,during the course of the next however long it is maybe a forty minute seminar . One question having to do with the fate of the yellow cell
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ226,28.42,28.5,and another question having to do with the fate of the blue cell . And that basically then launch me into the actual data part of the talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ227,28.5,28.5,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ228,29.02,29.07,This particular image right here is the `` home image ''
,,,or the home slide that I wa referring to just a minute ago . And a you 'll see this image is going to reappear again and again and again
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ229,29.07,29.16,in my talk during transition . And we 'll see just in a couple of minute how that can get played out
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ230,29.16,29.21,and how it can be extraordinarily effective in enabling the audience to follow a talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ231,29.27,29.27,Ok so now we 've built up an introduction and we 're ready for the middle right ? So we 're ready for the middle of the talk which is the meat .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ232,29.34,29.34,But there 's a problem . And that is that audience have fairly limited attention span .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ233,29.34,29.34,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ234,29.42,29.42,This is an interesting graph so let 's look at a little bit of data . This is a plot of the percentage of a class that 's paying full attention to a lecturer
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ235,29.42,29.52,over the time during which the lecture is being delivered . Ok there 's some good news right ?
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ236,29.52,29.57,The good news is right here in your introduction people are actually kinda tuned in and listening . And here 's the bad news which is that ok let 's face it
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ237,29.57,30.2,depending on how compelling the lecturer is it might be here or it might be way down there
,,,but the bottom line is that at no under no circumstance are you ever going to get
,,,100 % audience attention for your entire talk . Why is that ? Well think about being a member of the audience .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ238,30.2,30.2,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ239,30.28,30.5,Why doe this happen ? It 's because we 're human ! We have thought we have thought that intrude on our attention span
,,,we have thought about oh my gosh did I remember to load that gel or turn off the power supply
,,,we have thought about whether we actually are going to be on time getting the kid from daycare
,,,we have thought about someone we just met you know we have all these random thought that intrude so we 're human and we 're going to space out .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ240,30.58,30.58,We then a speaker have two choice one is we could say eh ok someone spaced out take no prisoner you spaced out forget it .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ241,31.06,31.06,You 're just never going to understand anything else I say . Or we can just acknowledge the fact that the audience is human
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ242,31.06,31.13,that every single member of an audience is going to tune out at some point .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ243,31.19,31.19,And we can build in a mechanism within our talk to enable them to catch up .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ244,31.24,31.24,So obviously I kind of recommend the latter . So if the middle is the meat of the talk and it 's the time when the audience is going to zone out at some point
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ245,31.24,31.33,why ? Because they 're just people ! Well what are we going to do about it ? What I suggest you do is to visualize the middle of the talk in the following way .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ246,31.45,31.59,You 're going to have a series of episode or data dive
,,,that you 're going to present little story and a you 're presenting a particular story you 're going to start at a level
,,,that 's fairly untechnical and you might actually get pretty deep into the data . To a level that 's really going to appeal really just to specialist in your field .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ247,31.59,31.59,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ248,32.07,32.18,Now if we were to give a talk and start presenting our data and we 've all been at seminar where people do this
,,,where we just go down into depth and then we just do data data data data data data data data
,,,and then we conclude and it 's over we 've lost people along the way . So this structure this visual structure here is a way of planning your talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ249,32.18,32.5,so that you can think about diving down into data and then coming up for air
,,,and it 's at these transition point between data dive that you use your home image to basically let the audience member
,,,catch up and know where you 've just been what you 're concluding from that part of the data
,,,and where you 're going to go next . So let 's look at an example of one of those data dive from one of my seminar .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ250,32.5,32.5,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ251,32.57,33.03,You 've already seen the introduction to the seminar you 've already seen how I introduced
,,,my home slide . At this point in my talk I 've gone through a review of the literature
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ252,33.03,33.08,the first data dive and I 'm now beginning part two of the talk . And here 's the beginning of that section . So once again you see
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ253,33.08,33.08,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ254,33.08,33.15,this home image and you see the two question . We 're half way through the talk but I 'm summarizing part one
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ255,33.15,33.2,and getting ready to introduce the second set of question . At this point then I now start to explain that a we focus on the blue cell
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ256,33.2,33.33,that we 're going to be looking at the role of a separate protein that is actually expressed in a subset of neuron within the different layer .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ257,33.42,33.49,And then I explain that we 've generated knock mouse in which we 've inserted a reporter into the cell that normally express this protein
,,,so that we can see their axonal connection . And now we do n't really need to focus on the data but look there 's a sentence
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ258,33.49,34.05,at the top that basically say what I just told you then we see a simple figure from the control in which I would point out that what I want the audience to look at
,,,are the blue axon that label the connection between the two hemisphere . That 's in the control then we look at the mutant the thing I 'm going to emphasize
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ259,34.05,34.13,is the absence of those connection here . Now we 're going to look at it from the side same stuff sentence two simple image
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ260,34.13,34.2,word will match the content were I really delivering the seminar to you . And then I tell you what I told just told you .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ261,34.2,34.2,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ262,34.28,34.34,I just told you that the blue cell express this protein that they form this type of connection
,,,and then I say you know in the first part of the talk I told you about another pathway .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ263,34.39,34.5,So you might be wondering what is the relationship between these two pathway ? So then I will go on to actually test that connection by presenting more data
,,,that would then build up into a small conclusion slide showing you that this protein represses the expression of this gene .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ264,34.58,35.04,So simple graphic that really emphasize the bottom line
,,,the story that I 'm telling you with the minimum essential data . Ok so we 've gone through the meat thinking about data dive coming back making transition .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ265,35.04,35.04,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ266,35.13,35.13,Now let 's think about how to conclude a talk . Here 's the good news is that a you say
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ267,35.13,35.18,and now in conclusion look what happens to the attention level of your audience . It 's like oh it 's over hey I better see what I just saw .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ268,35.18,35.18,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ269,35.28,35.28,So that 's good news now you 've got one more really good chance to deliver your take to the audience effectively .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ270,35.34,35.46,There 's a danger to this though a well and that 's the danger of hearing
,,,for example forty minute into a talk someone say `` Oh to conclude ''
,,,and our we 're like `` oh good you know actually they 're ending twenty minute early that 's great I can actually get a little bit more work done today . ''
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ271,35.46,36,So they say in conclusion blah blah blah blah blah blah and then they say `` and now in part two of my talk '' and what 's our response a an audience ?
,,,We 're like `` oooh dude no '' . Why is that ? It 's because it wa a false ending . And it got u all excited . So if you 're going to conclude part one of your talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ272,36,36,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ273,36,36,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ274,36,36.08,do the audience of favor of saying to some sum up this first part of the seminar and that way you wo n't create a false expectation .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ275,36.16,36.28,But the good news is you will perk up interest a you signal your conclusion and that mean that you have one last chance to really reiterate your specific conclusion
,,,and most of u remember to do that . But it 's easy to forget to sort of back out to the big picture .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ276,36.28,36.28,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ277,36.34,36.43,And return to the beginning to have your talk come full circle so that you 're really ending by revisiting the big question
,,,that you introduced at the very first part of the talk . So again here 's how I would do it in my talk just a a visual
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ278,36.43,36.5,example of how one might think about this . Concluding up now sentence at the top the same diagram that you 've seen before
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ279,36.5,37.04,about this repression and now adding other thing you have n't seen in the data but I would add that just to remind them
,,,that at least one of these mechanism work through the modulation of chromatin they would have seen that slide already .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ280,37.1,37.1,I would then connect it back to the first part of the talk and talk about a little switch that had gotten set up .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ281,37.16,37.23,I would then refer back even earlier to a part of the talk that you did n't see now going back to the really big picture
,,,question about how different type of neuron emerge over time . Many of these question are still unanswered and therefore represent a frontier in my field .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ282,37.23,37.23,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ283,37.33,37.46,I would then wrap up by acknowledging of course the colleague that have contributed to the work over time
,,,and then here 's a trick a you get to the very end of your talk rather than leaving up your acknowledgement slide
,,,have your conclusion slide appear at the very end . For the question and answer period .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ284,37.46,37.46,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ285,37.51,37.51,Why is that ? Well it help the audience . Remember everything is in service of the audience and I actually have the misfortune
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ286,37.51,37.58,of working on three gene all of which have name that end in two and none of which are memorable by anyone who doe n't work on them .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ287,38.05,38.05,So by putting this picture up I 'm enabling the audience to actually ask intelligent question .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ288,38.12,38.18,First you know if they 're struggling to remember which gene they had a question about and secondly when I 'm answering a question
,,,I can actually use the visuals to explain my answer . And that turn out to be very helpful . So I really recommend that at the end of your talk
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ289,38.18,38.18,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ290,38.18,38.26,during Q and A put your summary slide back up again . It 's helpful for you and for the people attending your talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ291,38.26,38.26,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ292,38.32,38.32,Ok so what have I just told you about organizing a great talk ? First of all use PowerPoint wisely .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ293,38.4,38.4,Have very clean minimal slide . Secondly start out with a broad introduction so that everyone in the audience
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ294,38.4,38.55,understands the big question that are compelling in your field and then introduce the specific gradually
,,,giving them just enough background information so that they can follow the data but not so much that they 're overwhelmed .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ295,39.01,39.27,Third think of the talk a consisting of these episode or little data dive in which you 're going to go
,,,at a point into your data remember the minimum essential data and then you 're going to go into some depth but then you come up for air
,,,and allow the audience to regroup see where you 've just been frame the next question and then get there logically rather than just going through data data data data
,,,which wa just going to leave people in the dust . A very effective way of making these transition explicit
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ296,39.27,39.45,is to design a home slide or a home image that is a signal to the audience that you 're at a point of transition
,,,and they will perk up and it will help them to understand the flow of your talk . And finally your conclusion here is just the opposite of the introduction .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ297,39.45,39.45,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ298,39.53,39.53,You start more specific with what you 've learned but then end up broad again . So is this all you need to know to give a great talk ?
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ299,39.53,40.16,No way ! Right ? I mean these are just some basic rule or suggestion or advice
,,,about how to create slide that are user audience and how to structure your talk so that it 's well organized and very very clear
,,,and simple for an audience to follow . But there are a lot of thing that go into giving a great talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ300,40.16,40.16,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ301,40.22,40.22,There 's the whole performance aspect of speaking . There 's the actual scientific content
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ302,40.22,40.28,but at least in term of performance you can practice that you can and should rehearse your talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ303,40.36,40.51,In fact the entire time from the first day of graduate school all the way well into being a tenured professor
,,,at Stanford I rehearsed every talk every lecture
,,,every journal club that I gave . Every one of them . And finally I got so comfortable with speaking I do n't actually have to do it anymore .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ304,40.51,40.51,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ305,40.51,40.51,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ306,40.58,41.04,But that mean rehearsing out loud and often in front of an audience dozen and dozen and dozen of talk
,,,get feedback and practice the way you 're going to speak . Have the word rehearsed and get some input from your colleague
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ307,41.04,41.13,about whether you 've identified effectively the minimum essential data for the talk .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ308,41.18,41.18,Secondly have yourself videotaped . Go and watch yourself and see what you do . See if you 're gesturing naturally and so on .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ309,41.18,41.18,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ310,41.18,41.18,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ311,41.24,41.29,So those kind of aspect of delivery are much more effectively done one on one
,,,rather than through a format like this . Another great resource that I highly recommend is a wonderful book by Michael Alley
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ312,41.29,41.37,called The Craft of Scientific Presentations . If you 're going to have just a single book on scientific presentation in your bookshelf I personally would recommend this one .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ313,41.37,41.37,
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ314,41.46,41.46,It 's a terrific model and it 's actually the basis of a lot the information that I 've presented to you today .
Hp7Id3Yb9XQ315,41.51,41.51,Well that 's it ! Thank you so much I hope this ha been helpful and I wish you every success with your talk in the future .
1VCaJ4dSHak1,0.01,0.01,Using gesture when give a public speech is a very important part of your presentation .
1VCaJ4dSHak2,0.07,0.18,If you fail to use gesture properly and you do awkward gesture throughout your presentation
,,,you are probably going to distract your audience and you are not going to get the impact that
,,,you want when you presenting .
1VCaJ4dSHak3,0.21,0.36,So what are four gesture that we use and how can we use them and use them effectively
,,,during our presentation ?
,,,Hi I am Ryan McLean and I am from publicspeakingpower.com where we teach people like you how to become
,,,powerful public speaker .
1VCaJ4dSHak4,0.38,0.44,So I am going to walk you through the four gesture that you can use in your presentation
,,,and so you can become more powerful and effective public speaker .
1VCaJ4dSHak5,0.49,1.06,Gesture number one are descriptive Gestures so these are gesture that we are using to
,,,describe something or situation .We might draw comparison between something thats
,,,really big and something thats really small or we might use it to contrast certain item
,,,or to depict the size .
1VCaJ4dSHak6,1.08,1.19,A great example that I am taking from toy master is if you are using a metaphor something
,,,is like a tiny little bird and you are holding like cup stand stating the metaphor of the
,,,bird and also implying size being small .
1VCaJ4dSHak7,1.22,1.31,You can also use descriptive gesture to say shape say it wa the box this big back
,,,these and you showing square shape of the box using your gesture .
1VCaJ4dSHak8,1.36,1.52,You can also talk about movement so moving from here to there picking up a box you
,,,can talk about location the table wa over here and there wa magazine on the table and
,,,you can even talk about the number like I said four different gesture that we are going
,,,to use .
1VCaJ4dSHak9,1.53,2.09,So descriptive gesture are very helpful because when we are speaking all we have is our word
,,,all we have is what come out of our mouth and by using descriptive gesture we can
,,,actually improve the impact and improve the comprehension of our audience so that our
,,,message get across more effectively .
1VCaJ4dSHak10,2.13,2.13,Number two is Emphatic gesture that a confusing word so let me explain it .
1VCaJ4dSHak11,2.19,2.25,Emphatic gesture are like emotional gesture so if we are sad we could slump down and talk
,,,about thing sad and we are angry we could put our fist together and make angry face .
1VCaJ4dSHak12,2.3,3.03,So we can use these gesture to symbolise the feeling that we have and that also emphatic
,,,gesture help u in more genuine so what are you talking about I am so angry when
,,,this happened and we are using this angry gesture it actually give more humph to our
,,,presentation and make sing more genuine yes he were angry I can see his body language
,,,he wa angry but if you were saying Yeah I wa really angry and your body language
,,,is just slumped and you kind of look depressed well may be they are not going to believe
,,,that you are actually angry .
1VCaJ4dSHak13,3.04,3.04,So actually it give make your presentation look more genuine .
1VCaJ4dSHak14,3.09,3.22,Number three a Suggestive gesture so these are the thing like mood an expression
,,,for example : you could say I welcome you in with open arm since you got your open palm
,,,symbolises that you are open .
1VCaJ4dSHak15,3.23,3.4,So you could say that this guy in audience who wa just wont listen to anything else
,,,or saying he just NO and you are crossing your arm and you kind of you are suggesting
,,,that even though he may be crossing his arm he wa closed off that wa the vibe that
,,,he wa giving off the emotion that he wa giving off .
1VCaJ4dSHak16,3.44,3.53,You could do lot of other thing like striking your shoulder you know NAHH !
,,,Who care or you could also you know even show your back and when there you just dint
,,,care about I wa talking about .
1VCaJ4dSHak17,3.56,4.06,Last one number four is Prompting Gestures ; So these are the one that prompt the audience
,,,to do something so what I am going to take Tony Robbins doe this really well he might
,,,say raise your hand if you want to earn million dollar this year .
1VCaJ4dSHak18,4.1,4.15,And so I am raising my hand a I am telling people to raise their hand hence they are
,,,more likely to do it .
1VCaJ4dSHak19,4.16,4.16,Or you could say let get warmed up everyone let s jump up and down on the spot .
1VCaJ4dSHak20,4.22,4.27,So you can see in the video I am jumping and so it encourages audience or prompt them
,,,to do something that you want to do .
1VCaJ4dSHak21,4.31,4.37,So they have the four gesture which we can use while giving a presentation and there
,,,are some idea on how you can use them .
1VCaJ4dSHak22,4.4,4.44,When it come down to using them effectively I am going to create an entirely other video
,,,and podcast .
1VCaJ4dSHak23,4.46,4.52,About that I have got five tip on you can use them more effectively but really it come
,,,down to preparation and practice and being natural in your gesture .
1VCaJ4dSHak24,4.56,4.56,Dont try and feel force and you dont feel natural then dont do it .
1VCaJ4dSHak25,5.02,5.1,If it is flowing like it doe in conversation everyday conversation with your friend
,,,with your family with your colleague then thats the good sign that theyre going
,,,to be hand gesture that will work .
1VCaJ4dSHak26,5.13,5.19,And also you just you want to avoid those hand gesture that just really take away from
,,,your presentation and dont support what you are presenting .
1VCaJ4dSHak27,5.23,5.28,So I guess the rule is gesture are supporting what you are saying and then they are probably
,,,going to be great .
1VCaJ4dSHak28,5.29,5.41,If it take you away from what you are saying like scratching your face adjusting clothes
,,,playing with your ring figure than probably they will take you away from the presentation
,,,and you dont want to use them .
1VCaJ4dSHak29,5.43,5.54,For more video audio and article just like this one you can get them on blog hit over
,,,the publicspeckingpower.com and I will see you in next episode where we talk about the
,,,five tip for better public speaking gesture .
h6sm47j-Am41,0,0.04,I have often heard professional speaker say
,,,you should start your presentation with a joke .
h6sm47j-Am42,0.07,0.09,That attention grabber is critical
,,,and I wan na disagree with this advice .
h6sm47j-Am43,0.12,0.2,I do not recommend telling a setup punchline joke
,,,the kind that a stand comic would tell
,,,and there are a lotta reason why .
h6sm47j-Am44,0.21,0.32,Now at the same time I am 100 % in favor
,,,of using lighthearted humor in a presentation
,,,and I do it often when I do professional presentation
,,,and when I teach in college .
h6sm47j-Am45,0.34,0.37,So there are some difference here
,,,but I can give you a really straight ahead way
,,,to add humor without the big risk of a punchline joke .
h6sm47j-Am46,0.41,0.41,So let 's take a look .
h6sm47j-Am47,0.47,0.47,Hi I 'm Alex Lyon and this is Communication Coach .
h6sm47j-Am48,0.5,0.52,We 're here to help you increase your impact
,,,and lead your team to higher level of excellence .
h6sm47j-Am49,0.56,0.59,Lotta bad advice out there in my humble opinion
,,,about telling joke a attention grabber .
h6sm47j-Am410,1.02,1.02,Here is the most common situation that I have seen .
h6sm47j-Am411,1.06,1.09,The speaker try to start off with a joke
,,,that they have created and then nobody laugh .
h6sm47j-Am412,1.12,1.18,And then instead of just moving on
,,,they start chuckling nervously to cue people
,,,that that wa a joke .
h6sm47j-Am413,1.19,1.22,The audience may or may not chuckle nervously
,,,and it 's an incredibly awkward situation .
h6sm47j-Am414,1.26,1.32,Now think about this this is the first moment
,,,of your presentation and you completely bombed
,,,and there are nothing but cricket and nervous laughter .
h6sm47j-Am415,1.35,1.35,This is not the way you want to start a presentation .
h6sm47j-Am416,1.38,1.38,It 's really high risk and really low reward .
h6sm47j-Am417,1.42,1.46,So I am against these stand comic setup
,,,and punchline one joke .
h6sm47j-Am418,1.48,1.5,Now having said that I 'm gon na sound
,,,like I 'm contradicting myself but I am not .
h6sm47j-Am419,1.53,1.56,There 's a lot of way to add humor
,,,to your attention grabber without the big risk .
h6sm47j-Am420,2,2.05,So let 's look at three easy way to add
,,,some lighthearted humor and still grab
,,,your audience 's attention .
h6sm47j-Am421,2.07,2.1,The first way is to deliberately quote
,,,someone else that 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am422,2.12,2.22,Now by quoting them directly by saying a Jerry Seinfeld
,,,once said or a George Burns once said
,,,then you may even have the piece of paper in your hand
,,,and read the quotation .
h6sm47j-Am423,2.25,2.28,What you 're doing there is you 're drawing
,,,people 's attention to what that other person said
,,,and it take the attention off of you a the joke teller .
h6sm47j-Am424,2.31,2.31,So you know they have a funny line that kill .
h6sm47j-Am425,2.34,2.34,It 's already been tested .
h6sm47j-Am426,2.36,2.37,They 're stand comic they probably worked on it
,,,for year to get it just right .
h6sm47j-Am427,2.39,2.44,And now you 're both you and your audience
,,,focusing on that little line
,,,that little humor a an object that you 're both looking at .
h6sm47j-Am428,2.47,2.47,So the attention 's not on you .
h6sm47j-Am429,2.48,2.55,And if it bomb which they usually do n't
,,,because if they 're funny they 're funny
,,,because it 's already been worked out
,,,then what you do is you get a little chuckle
,,,you get a little laugh .
h6sm47j-Am430,2.56,2.56,But if it bomb then it 's not really on you .
h6sm47j-Am431,2.59,2.59,It 's on George Burns it 's on Jerry Seinfeld .
h6sm47j-Am432,3.01,3.05,I wa saying to my wife the other day
,,,you know Jerry Seinfeld said in his bit
,,, My parent just moved to Florida .
h6sm47j-Am433,3.08,3.09, Now they did n't wan na move to Florida
,,, but they 're 65 and that 's the law . ''
h6sm47j-Am434,3.09,3.12,And my wife laughed huge .
h6sm47j-Am435,3.14,3.28,I 'm always trying to make my wife laugh
,,,but she laugh when I tell Jerry Seinfeld joke
,,,and I think it 's because you can hear the comedian
,,,telling the joke in your mind a the person share it
,,,and it transport you a little bit more
,,,than hearing me Alex Lyon a the speaker
,,,tell my one joke .
h6sm47j-Am436,3.29,3.29,So quote someone else that 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am437,3.31,3.31,Use a quotation .
h6sm47j-Am438,3.32,3.32,That 's a great attention grabber no problem .
h6sm47j-Am439,3.34,3.36,The other way you can add humor is by telling
,,,a lighthearted story .
h6sm47j-Am440,3.38,3.5,And the way to make a story lighthearted
,,,and by the way I have a whole nother video
,,,on how to tell story a attention grabber
,,,I 'll put that link in the description below
,,,is you add a little bit of a goal to the person
,,,in the story .
h6sm47j-Am441,3.51,4.01,They 're trying to reach a destination
,,,achieve something and that way your story get humorous
,,,because the obstacle along the way prevent them
,,,from reaching that goal and it becomes
,,,pretty lighthearted pretty funny .
h6sm47j-Am442,4.02,4.16,That 's the whole reason why a movie like Dumb and Dumber
,,,is funny because it 's a road trip movie
,,,where these two guy are trying to get from A to B
,,,from Providence to Aspen to see about a girl
,,,and everything that can go wrong doe go wrong
,,,on their way .
h6sm47j-Am443,4.16,4.24,And so all these mishap become very humorous
,,,because you know there 's a goal in mind
,,,that is preventing and they 're being prevented
,,,from getting there .
h6sm47j-Am444,4.24,4.27,So adding a little bit of a humorous goal
,,,to your story can make that story more lighthearted .
h6sm47j-Am445,4.3,4.3,So you can tell a story .
h6sm47j-Am446,4.3,4.35,It 's not a punchline but it add just a little bit
,,,of a chuckle a little bit of a smile
,,,to your audience 's experience .
h6sm47j-Am447,4.37,4.41,And the third way is really easy
,,,and that is to show something visual
,,,on the screen that you know is funny .
h6sm47j-Am448,4.44,4.49,So maybe there 's a cute picture
,,,maybe there 's a little bit of a joke even on the slide
,,,and you do n't have to tell it .
h6sm47j-Am449,4.5,4.52,You just have to say something and then show the image
,,,and people chuckle .
h6sm47j-Am450,4.53,4.53,You 've probably seen speaker use humor this way .
h6sm47j-Am451,4.56,5.02,It 's a very low way because when you were looking
,,,at the internet or doing your reading
,,,you came across it and you laughed
,,,or somebody forward it to you and you laughed .
h6sm47j-Am452,5.04,5.04,Everybody think it 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am453,5.05,5.05,Everyone know it 's funny .
h6sm47j-Am454,5.06,5.08,And so you share it in a presentation and it 's almost
,,,guaranteed to get a smile .
h6sm47j-Am455,5.11,5.27,So I am 100 % telling your own setup
,,,punchline joke but I am also 100 % in favor
,,,of using lighthearted humor and these are three
,,,low way to do it without worrying
,,,about nobody laughing
,,,and just hearing those cricket chirping .
h6sm47j-Am456,5.29,5.29,That 's a really hard way to start a presentation .
h6sm47j-Am457,5.32,5.37,And trust me I 've seen a lotta people crash and burn
,,,and they just completely fall apart
,,,because they 're trying to do it that way .
h6sm47j-Am458,5.39,5.48,So question of the day what are your suggestion
,,,for adding humor but not joke to your attention grabber
,,,in your presentation ?
,,,I would love to hear your comment and your question
,,,in that section below .
h6sm47j-Am459,5.51,5.54,So thanks god bless and I hope you grab
,,,your audience 's attention really well
,,,in your next presentation .
i68a6M5FFBc&t1,0,0,Powerful Presentations : Simply Stated .
i68a6M5FFBc&t2,0.03,0.03,Around the world every day thousand if not million of people give presentation .
i68a6M5FFBc&t3,0.08,0.08,Some are great and have a powerful impact on their audience . Others well let 's
i68a6M5FFBc&t4,0.08,0.13,just say they 're work in progress . This is Powerful Presentations : Simply Stated .
i68a6M5FFBc&t5,0.13,0.13,
i68a6M5FFBc&t6,0.2,0.2,Meet Jim an aspiring professional trying to make it in the world . Jim used to give
i68a6M5FFBc&t7,0.2,0.24,presentation like just about everyone else he knew . PowerPoint wa his tool of choice .
i68a6M5FFBc&t8,0.24,0.24,
i68a6M5FFBc&t9,0.29,0.39,He 'd use it like an outline with a header followed by bullet after bullet and sometimes
,,,even sub ! When he wanted to be fancy he 'd add what usually turned out to be
,,,an ineffective chart or sometimes a table . And when Jim wanted to really spice thing
i68a6M5FFBc&t10,0.39,0.44,up he 'd add yep clip art . Unfortunately Jim 's approach would often confuse and
i68a6M5FFBc&t11,0.44,0.49,bore people . This wa a problem because he had important thing to say . And because it
i68a6M5FFBc&t12,0.49,0.49,
i68a6M5FFBc&t13,0.49,0.54,wa dimming his prospect for success . Fortunately Jim learned a better way and did n't stay
i68a6M5FFBc&t14,0.54,0.59,in the dark for long .
i68a6M5FFBc&t15,1.01,1.01,Perhaps most importantly he now focus on the story he want to tell . In
i68a6M5FFBc&t16,1.01,1.11,doing so he try to follow a simple structure with a clear beginning middle and end that
,,,link together his various point and build to his conclusion . When formulating his story
i68a6M5FFBc&t17,1.11,1.17,Jim us a simple pad of paper or sicky note . Staying low tech at this stage help him think
i68a6M5FFBc&t18,1.17,1.22,more creatively and stay outside the box . He then considers what tool will help him
i68a6M5FFBc&t19,1.22,1.27,best tell his story . Jim sometimes opts to use a whiteboard flip chart handout or
i68a6M5FFBc&t20,1.27,1.32,even no prop at all . When it make sense for him to use PowerPoint he try to remember
i68a6M5FFBc&t21,1.32,1.36,the adage that sometimes le is more . '' He doe n't dumb down his presentation
i68a6M5FFBc&t22,1.36,1.42,but he doe try to limit each slide to one key idea . Or depending on the content he
i68a6M5FFBc&t23,1.42,1.48,sometimes build an idea incrementally so it 's easy to follow . He look for visual
i68a6M5FFBc&t24,1.48,1.53,way to tell his story with minimal text photo and clear chart and graph . Sometimes
i68a6M5FFBc&t25,1.53,2.05,he 'll use quote but he try to remember that people ca n't read his slide and truly
,,,listen at the same time . Jim still us plenty of text to help him remember what he
i68a6M5FFBc&t26,2.05,2.11,want to say but he hide it in his note that only he see .
i68a6M5FFBc&t27,2.17,2.22,Jim 's new approach take more time energy and rehearsal but it 's been well worth
,,,the effort . His audience are now much more engaged and better understand and remember
i68a6M5FFBc&t28,2.22,2.28,his presentation . And a if that were n't enough
i68a6M5FFBc&t29,2.28,2.32,his pocketbook doe n't mind either . This ha been Powerful Presentations : Simply Stated .

,,,"them meaningful, we have sold four"
,,,million iPhones to date. divided
RHX-xnP_G5s27,3.24,3.28,four million by two hundred day.

,,,So we put into context we said
,,,"enough memory to listen. to your music,"
RHX-xnP_G5s29,3.53,3.59,"while traveling to the moon and back now,"
,,,12 gig mean something to me. Make
RHX-xnP_G5s30,3.59,4.06,"number meaningful, one of the most"
,,,effective element of a Steve Jobs
,,,"presentation. is that, they are easy on"
RHX-xnP_G5s31,4.08,4.1,the eye. His presentation are visual
RHX-xnP_G5s32,4.1,4.22,"and simple,"
,,,while most speaker fill their slide
,,,"with mind, data and text and"
,,,shard
,,,"chomp doe, just the opposite. He us"
RHX-xnP_G5s33,4.22,4.28,very little text and usually one maybe
,,,two image per slide. You see you want
RHX-xnP_G5s34,4.28,4.33,to paint a picture for your audience
,,,without overwhelming them. Inspiring
RHX-xnP_G5s35,4.33,4.38,presentation are short on bullet point
,,,and big on visuals. If you really want
RHX-xnP_G5s36,4.38,4.42,your presentation. to pop treat it like a
RHX-xnP_G5s37,4.42,4.55,show when ad and flow theme and
,,,transition Jobs includes video clip
,,,"demonstration and guest, he also ha a"
,,,knack for dramatic flair and it very
,,,effective for example. when introducing
RHX-xnP_G5s38,4.55,5.15,"the MacBook Air, Jobs drew cheer by"
,,,opening a manila interoffice envelope
,,,and holding the laptop out for everyone
,,,"to see This is the new MacBook Air, and"
,,,you can get a feel for how thin it is:
,,,What is the one memorable moment of your
,,,"presentation. identified ahead of time,"
RHX-xnP_G5s39,5.18,5.23,then build up to it it will help from
,,,our friend. Everything will work today
RHX-xnP_G5s40,5.23,5.28,"and finally, rehearse rehearse and"
,,,rehearse some more. Let me show You how
RHX-xnP_G5s41,5.28,5.35,"easy that, is now, Steve Jobs make it"
,,,look easy because he spends hour
,,,rehearsing. He can not pull off an
RHX-xnP_G5s42,5.38,5.45,intricate presentation with video clip
,,,and demonstration and outside speaker
,,,"without practice. The result, a"

7MWaeOHDBOg1,0.03,0.09,Presentation or talking to your bos in
,,,"the elevator, there are five secret to"
,,,"being a confident speaker. First,"
7MWaeOHDBOg2,0.09,0.13,"your stance. Second, your sound third"
7MWaeOHDBOg3,0.13,0.17,"smile, fourth silence and fit your site."
7MWaeOHDBOg4,0.25,0.25,"First, your stance. when you"
7MWaeOHDBOg5,0.25,0.28,you need to have a nice firm stance. your
7MWaeOHDBOg6,0.28,0.35,"foot should be about hip apart, not"
,,,too wide and not too close. We want to
7MWaeOHDBOg7,0.35,1.32,have our foot firmly planted on the
,,,"ground, no crossing of the leg,"
,,,no swaying back and forth no dancing
,,,backwards and forward no pacing
,,,side
,,,and by all mean no popping of the hip
,,,"Once we have that firm, stable stance, we"
,,,need to then stand up nice and tall to
,,,"have a length in our torso, but our"
,,,shoulder relaxed to increase the
,,,distance between our shoulder and our
,,,ear and to imagine the top of our head
,,,ha a string going Right to the ceiling
,,,making? U stand taller than usual? What
,,,do we do with our arm? The question
,,,every new speaker ha keep them in a
,,,neutral position at your side do
,,,clasp in front or behind do do this
,,,defensive move and when at your
,,,side then you can use them freely to
,,,gesture and add impact to your speech. If
7MWaeOHDBOg8,1.32,1.52,standing behind a lectern be
,,,careful not to grasp onto the lectern
,,,"for dear life,"
,,,"this can cause you to bend over,"
,,,impacting your posture negatively
,,,prevent you from doing any gesture and
,,,you might tap on it or make other
,,,distracting noise. So if you do need to
7MWaeOHDBOg9,1.52,1.58,"use the lectern for your note, make sure"
,,,that you are not touching it and that
,,,you are gesturing. talked about
7MWaeOHDBOg10,1.58,2,"your stance. now, talk about your"
7MWaeOHDBOg11,2,2.02,sound when you are giving a speech. that
7MWaeOHDBOg12,2.02,2.46,great stance is the basis for phenomenal
,,,"projection,"
,,,it will allow you to speak from your
,,,diaphragm and fill the room with sound
,,,make sure that you really lower those
,,,"shoulder, because when We get nervous"
,,,which most of U are when We speak we
,,,"tend to make those shoulder, go higher"
,,,and higher and higher towards our ear
,,,our voice get higher and higher and
,,,faster and faster and it help
,,,"our presentation relax those shoulder,"
,,,lower that voice and make sure that you
,,,"speak in a slow, understandable case when"
,,,We working with sound also think
,,,about having variation. Add interest to
7MWaeOHDBOg13,2.46,2.49,your speech. with sound use up high tone
7MWaeOHDBOg14,2.49,2.55,"in a low tone, speak slow, and really"
,,,really fast yeah. These will Add a
7MWaeOHDBOg15,2.55,3.01,dynamic nature to your speech. making you
7MWaeOHDBOg16,3.01,3.04,look very confident. We talked about
7MWaeOHDBOg17,3.04,3.25,"stance, and your sound now, we have to"
,,,"talk about your smile, this is an"
,,,extension of your sound because people
,,,"who are smiling sound, more pleasant,"
,,,great to listen to you might
,,,think that you look cheesy and silly
,,,smiling through a speech. but you will
7MWaeOHDBOg18,3.25,3.25,not. You will look friendly.
7MWaeOHDBOg19,3.28,3.28,
7MWaeOHDBOg20,3.3,3.3,You will look confident. and you will
7MWaeOHDBOg21,3.3,3.33,look at ease a a speaker. even if you
7MWaeOHDBOg22,3.33,3.37,"really nervous on the inside, no one ha"
,,,to know put on a big smile. When you give
7MWaeOHDBOg23,3.37,3.4,a speech. So long a it is appropriate to
7MWaeOHDBOg24,3.4,3.43,"your topic now into the fourth s,"
,,,silence. How is silence. something that a
7MWaeOHDBOg25,3.47,3.47,
7MWaeOHDBOg26,3.47,3.52,confident speaker. doe in our culture we
7MWaeOHDBOg27,3.52,3.58,like to fill every single moment with
,,,sound We do like to pause between
,,,"sentence. We add word like, and So the"
7MWaeOHDBOg28,4.03,4.06,entire speech is one long run. We
7MWaeOHDBOg29,4.06,4.14,should prevent that and when We lose our
,,,train of thought or need to think of
,,,"What we want to say next,"
,,,"we often fill that time with um. Ah, like"
7MWaeOHDBOg30,4.14,4.25,"you know other mouth sound, This doe"
,,,"make a slip, professional prepared or"
,,,polished use silence. It is your best
7MWaeOHDBOg31,4.25,4.25,"friend. Lastly, your sight, what I mean by"
7MWaeOHDBOg32,4.29,4.41,"sight, is what about when you looking"
,,,"out at the audience, making eye contact"
,,,is an important part of being a great
,,,confident. speaker you need to hold that
7MWaeOHDBOg33,4.45,4.55,"eye contact Just like you would, in a"
,,,one conversation to establish
,,,"rapport with your audience, You might"
,,,"feel that it s, too long five to seven."
7MWaeOHDBOg34,4.57,4.57,"Second in a speech. but that s, exactly"
7MWaeOHDBOg35,4.57,5.02,what you should do it will decrease the
,,,distance If you will between the speaker.
7MWaeOHDBOg36,5.05,5.16,"and audience, make sure that you do"
,,,scan back and forth without making any
,,,lasting contact on member of your
,,,"audience, also make sure you do do The"
,,,hunt and peck. what I call it
7MWaeOHDBOg37,5.16,5.22,where you look at two people over and
,,,"over, and ignore the rest of the crowd."
7MWaeOHDBOg38,5.24,5.43,Maybe those people are smiling and
,,,"nodding, but you need to make an effort"
,,,to establish eye contact with all part
,,,of the room by all mean ignore the
,,,advice you might have received at some
,,,point where someone said if you
,,,nervous all you need to do is Just stare
,,,at the back wall of the room and it
,,,be the easiest speech you ever gave well.
7MWaeOHDBOg39,5.46,5.51,"also be the worst speech, because"
,,,"no one in your audience, will be involved"
,,,and engaged because you be making?
,,,I contact with him. We have talked about
7MWaeOHDBOg40,5.51,6.03,"today, the 5 is they are stance, sound,"
,,,"smile, silence and sight. if you apply"
7MWaeOHDBOg41,6.03,6.09,"these principle, you will be a confident"
,,,speaker. The next time you are giving a
7MWaeOHDBOg42,6.13,6.15,formal speech or your elevator speech.
