presentation or talking to your bos in
the elevator there are five secret to
being a confident speaker first there 's
your stance second your sound third
smile fourth silence and fit your site
first your stance when you 're speaking
you need to have a nice firm stance your
foot should be about hip apart not
too wide and not too close we want to
have our foot firmly planted on the
ground no crossing of the leg
no swaying back and forth no dancing
backwards and forward no pacing
side
and by all mean no popping of the hip
once we have that firm stable stance we
need to then stand up nice and tall to
have a length in our torso but our
shoulder relaxed to increase the
distance between our shoulder and our
ear and to imagine the top of our head
ha a string going right to the ceiling
making u stand taller than usual what
do we do with our arm the question
every new speaker ha keep them in a
neutral position at your side do n't
clasp in front or behind do n't do this
defensive move and when they 're at your
side then you can use them freely to
gesture and add impact to your speech if
you 're standing behind a lectern be
careful not to grasp onto the lectern
for dear life
this can cause you to bend over
impacting your posture negatively it 'll
prevent you from doing any gesture and
you might tap on it or make other
distracting noise so if you do need to
use the lectern for your note make sure
that you are not touching it and that
you are gesturing we 've talked about
your stance now let 's talk about your
sound when you are giving a speech that
great stance is the basis for phenomenal
projection
it will allow you to speak from your
diaphragm and fill the room with sound
make sure that you really lower those
shoulder because when we get nervous
which most of u are when we speak we
tend to make those shoulder go higher
and higher and higher towards our ear
our voice get higher and higher and
faster and faster and it doe n't help
our presentation relax those shoulder
lower that voice and make sure that you
speak in a slow understandable case when
we 're working with sound also think
about having variation add interest to
your speech with sound use up high tone
in a low tone speak slow and really
really fast yeah these will add a
dynamic nature to your speech making you
look very confident we talked about
stance and your sound now we have to
talk about your smile this is an
extension of your sound because people
who are smiling sound more pleasant
they 're great to listen to you might
think that you look cheesy and silly
smiling through a speech but you will
not you will look friendly
you will look confident and you will
look at ease a a speaker even if you 're
really nervous on the inside no one ha
to know put on a big smile when you give
a speech so long a it is appropriate to
your topic now into the fourth s
silence how is silence something that a
confident speaker doe in our culture we
like to fill every single moment with
sound we do n't like to pause between
sentence we add word like and so the
entire speech is one long run we
should prevent that and when we lose our
train of thought or need to think of
what we want to say next
we often fill that time with um ah like
you know other mouth sound this doe n't
make a slip professional prepared or
polished use silence it is your best
friend lastly your sight what I mean by
sight is what about when you 're looking
out at the audience making eye contact
is an important part of being a great
confident speaker you need to hold that
eye contact just like you would in a
one conversation to establish
rapport with your audience you might
feel that it 's too long five to seven
second in a speech but that 's exactly
what you should do it will decrease the
distance if you will between the speaker
and audience make sure that you do n't
scan back and forth without making any
lasting contact on member of your
audience also make sure you do n't do the
hunt and peck that 's what I call it
where you look at two people over and
over and ignore the rest of the crowd
maybe those people are smiling and
nodding but you need to make an effort
to establish eye contact with all part
of the room by all mean ignore the
advice you might have received at some
point where someone said if you 're
nervous all you need to do is just stare
at the back wall of the room and it 'll
be the easiest speech you ever gave well
it 'll also be the worst speech because
no one in your audience will be involved
and engaged because you wo n't be making
I contact with him we have talked about
today the 5 is they are stance sound
smile silence and sight if you apply
these principle you will be a confident
speaker the next time you are giving a
formal speech or your elevator speech
