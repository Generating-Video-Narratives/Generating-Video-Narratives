Just a reminder. If you would like to submit a question', 'during the webinar please go ahead and submit it via the chat function. If you', 'do that, then at the end, during the Q & A period, I will be presenting the', 'question that, come in through our chat to Lori So again, the objective for', 'today webinar is to introduce to patient, audience the difference between', 'health quality of life, and patient, reported outcome and just to', 'provide a little bit of background information for those who have been able to join our previous webinars. And', 'for those who have Just a little reminder. of what clinical outcome assessment. are on the FDA Science', 'COAS a measure, something that measure, a patient symptom, overall mental', 'state or the effect of a disease or condition on how the patient, function. and so essentially, COA. Tell you', 'something about how the patient, feel their function and we often hear about patient reported outcome pro, but there', 'are other. There are other. outcome measure, that fit into the COS', 'umbrella, and these include clinician reported outcome measure, Quinn, Rose, observer, reported outcome measure,', 'abstruse and performance outcome measure, per foe. So if you visit our', 'website, you can find. I think this is already our 8th webinar. So seven', 'additional webinars that describe COAH generally a well a validation of COAS', 'and other. special topic on COAS so at this point, like to turn it', 'over to our guest speaker laurie burke, and the founder of Laura, group and', 'she the former director of study end point and labeling development at the Food and drug Administration and she wa', 'a career US Public Health Service Officer with the US FDA and she wa the', 'first author of the FDA patient reported outcome Guidance which wa published back in 2009 And today she work a a', 'the head of her consulting company and collaborates with pharmaceutical research and medical product development', 'organization to promote best practice and patient, focused drug development, outcome research regulatory strategy,', 'product labeling and advertising and, in addition to her work, also an affiliate Associate professor at the', 'University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, so Laurie, like to turn it over to you now.', 'Ok, thank you very much Elizabeth My purpose for for doing this presentation', 'is to convince all of you on the phone. If you are already convinced that', 'these are very different thing, patient reported outcome and quality of', 'life, and even health quality of life, is a third very different thing,', 'not at all the same and it important for: u to use the appropriate', 'term to avoid misleading or confusing communication with our patient, group', 'and our stakeholder. These term both represent thing that are the', 'perspective of a person that can not be rated or reported by an observer,', 'because known only to the patient, so in even in the case of sign', 'that may by a patient I hearing beeping in My okay well say We can hear', 'yep, okay, great, so even in a case when a patient might have something that can be observed by', 'another person. I would call that a sign instead of a symptom,', 'for example, the act of scratching an itch the way the scratching is rated on', 'an instrument that patient reported can not be considered the same outcome, a', 'something reported by an observer, So this is very important when we get to', 'child or other. population that report for themselves that we no longer', 'can use patient reported outcome we no longer can measure Health quality of life, because those are thing,', 'that can only be reported by the patient, themselves and that why a Elizabeth.', 'described we have other. type of clinical outcome assessment. Besides, the patient, reported outcome that are', 'thought to be valid representation of the how patient may be feeling, but', 'there is no way to measure, it unless the patient, can report for themselves but', 'now. in order to understand the difference between a patient reported outcome and quality of life, it will help', 'you to understand how these term have been used. Historically next slide, so', 'patient reported outcome versus quality of life, are they the same a you heard me say already: no they not in My', 'opinion. How are they different well where do these term come from and I', 'think that would be the place to start so. Measuring quality of life, ha been', 'around for a long time. nothing new, but the problem that FDA had with', 'company who wanted to say that they were going to use quality of life, a an', 'endpoint or a a study objective or a a labeling claim.', 'An advertising claim. is that they were sure that the company knew what', 'they meant. What they were talking about, certainly FDA, know what wa meant.', 'and they were sure that If anyone would read this in a label or in an advertising claim. that they would know', 'what they meant. it ha the potential being very misleading so they had A very', 'difficult time, deciding a is their responsibility, whether or not the', 'quality of life, wa measured well, because quality of life, in My opinion. is', 'like beauty. It mean different thing, to each person. it includes not only a life', 'with health but also a life with comfort and happiness related to other. spec of', 'life, Besides, health, and FDA concluded that quality of life, is too general and', 'too undefined a concept to be measured specifically,', 'and it is not useful for Measuring treatment impact, so that same is not', 'true for health quality of life, next slide, so FDA spent a lot of time. in the early', '90 trying to figure out and getting consensus amongst every expert in the', 'field of health quality of life, research how they How to come up with a satisfactory definition of', 'health quality of life, and this is what appears in the 2009 FDA Pierrot', 'guidance, glossary health quality of life, is a multi concept that', 'represents the patient, general perception of the effect of illness and treatment on three important, very broad', 'area of life, physical, psychological and social. So, therefore, health', 'quality of life, can not be measured with a single question. How is your quality of life, today because then again, we still', 'know what the patient, is referring to and in order to make sense in the', 'realm of Measuring treatment impact, You need to know first,', 'going on in the patient, with the patient, with respect to the condition', 'that this treatment is supposedly having an impact, on next slide, so they', 'concluded and this also appears in the Pierrot 2009 Pierrot guidance, that', 'claiming a statistical and meaningful improvement in health quality of life, implies. First of all that you have', 'measured all health quality of life, domain, whether they, appropriate', 'or not We still have to know what is happening across the broad spectrum,', 'spectrum, of health quality of life, and it certainly need to measure,', 'those aspect of how the patient, feel or function. that, may have an impact, on', 'the physical, psychological and social. aspect of life, so by definition You', 'must first know what aspect of daily health is impacted by the disease and', 'how the patient, feel and function. in the population study which may be different for: different subpopulation', 'of the disease and then after you have shown that you Measuring the correct', 'thing and you sure that you Measuring the impact, of all those thing, on the important domain, of', 'health quality of life, then the study would need to show that overall', 'there wa general improvement in health quality of life, and that', 'no single domain, demonstrated a decrement meaning, you have an', 'improvement in physical, and social. aspect of life, and a decrease in', 'psychological aspect of life, and still have an improvement overall, in', 'health quality of life, so this of course made the measurement of health quality of life, extremely', 'complicated and you see very few instance of health quality of', 'life, being used in and product development for a number of reason, but mostly because it very difficult to to measure, overall a we', 'said Already health quality of life, must be patient reported no one can understand the impact, of disease and', 'Health and treatment on quality of life, Besides, the patient, And so therefore, if', 'a clinician or another observer. responds to question about the patient, symptom, and other. component of', 'health quality of life, it is felt to be biased or invalid assessment of that concept the component of a a', 'subsequently a a result. The component of health quality of life, are often measured without the full', 'assessment of health quality of life, so a new, term wa needed, because', 'now, we are looking at lot of different measure measured captured from the', 'patient, perspective such a individual symptom, symptom, complex or individual', 'Aspect of functioning physical, lower limb functioning hand functioning', 'depending on what the condition is you will have A different measure that specific to the disease', 'I have the similar concern, however, related to whether or not the patient,', 'perspective is well measured in the clinical trial population.', 'targeted so because guidance, wa preceded proceeding on how to best do', 'this measurement development work this term wa needed, and the term patient', 'reported outcome wa born around the year 2001, a the Guidance wa moving', 'around the agency and lot of outside interaction. Wa going on between the', 'industry, academia, patient group and international regulator, so now.', 'you got the history of where patient outcome came from. It includes health, quality of life,', 'but it certainly includes a lot more than just health quality of life, measure, next next slide, so a clinical', 'trial endpoint is used. to define treatment benefit in a clinical trial so', 'a study endpoint ha to be defined using', 'the assessment. tool that you planning to use to capture that effective', 'treatment. So, for example, a trial may be done to see if a treatment decrease', 'pain, pain, intensity, so that the measure, is a measure, of pain, intensity, It could', 'be a zero to ten numeric rating scale, for example, the endpoint then is the change in pain, intensity, score from', 'baseline to the end, of study Whatever day that may be in however, It being', 'calculated and compared and statistically analyzed between treatment group so statistical analysis plan are', 'limited in term of a number of endpoint that they can accommodate,', 'because there is such a thing, a statistical power, and you only have A', 'Certain amount of power, to go around and address to address multiple endpoint in', 'a clinical trial so you can see another reason, that very rarely is', 'health quality of life, measured in the clinical trial and demonstrated adequately because adding overall', 'quality of life, to a measure, a it leaf four endpoint to the basic', 'measure of how patient they feel in term of their symptom, or how they', 'function on a daily basis due to their impact, of their disease next slide,', 'so and also before overall Health quality of life, next', 'slide, please, before overall Health quality of life, can be measured I must have A delay', 'because I do have the next slide, up yet measurement there We go patient most important symptom, and', 'daily functioning concern, must be measured first, a we said before and then the impact, on the other. more', 'general domain, of life, so what endpoint', 'should be prioritized in the context of each treatment and in each study design?', 'This is where You come in and it the goal overall goal of patient, engagement', 'to assist medical product developer in making sure that their clinical study is', 'going to be adequate to demonstrate treatment benefit and so you there need', 'to be some general research, general qualitative research.

Because they just do everything, of course', 'so they took everybody in their population ha taken a very well', 'health, status measure. So I sure You heard of and the physical, function domain, of that health status measure. is', 'the PF ten or physical, ten physical function ten for that ten item that', 'add up that, are go through an algorithm to generate a score that represents', 'physical, function in the population well, if you look at the both ten item you', 'will see that most of the item are pertaining to lower limb functioning', 'there are several item on how far you can walk, how much difficult You have walking.

Okay! Well, here, your challenge, question:', 'what are the core disease defining concept, that need to be identified', 'through engagement with each patient population is it how patient feel', 'related to their disease symptom, B, how patient observe their disease related', 'sign see how patient perceive their disease related problem with', 'functioning and daily life, or is it D the impact, of a B, and C on other. aspect', 'of functioning or is it Just a B, and C', 'or is it all the above? This is a very tricky question, so a B, and C represents', 'How patient feel and function. related', 'to their daily life, and their disease D', 'is the impact, of those three thing on other. aspect of functioning E is just', 'how patient feel and observe themselves', 'and how they function in daily life, and F is all the above? Are you ready for the', 'answer? Okay? Alright, it go the next', 'slide, the answer? is E the answer? is the core disease defining concept, are those', 'a B, and C and those are the one that need to be identified in each patient', 'population for which you want to develop, the patient, centered information so that', 'anyone can take that and study this patient population and know the impact,', 'of an Intervention on that population you may also want to study', 'the impact, of these thing, on other. aspect of functioning by Measuring health, quality of life, and other.', 'more general thing satisfaction with, treatment productivity or the economic', 'consequence of treatment but you do that, at all without First, measuring', 'these three thing first, So with that', 'I turn it back to you Elizabeth and I thank you very much', 'and so well one question that, came in is what is the difference between', 'health quality of life, and well well that, A good question', 'because I do know that well ha it a specific a definition a', 'health quality of life, but in My mind, I Tell you what I think and that', 'is that well is a lot like quality of life, it not really health', 'and it not really defined in a way', 'that you can understand what someone talking about, when, They say if I asked', 'you the question Elizabeth. how your well today so it D be tough to', 'answer? what yeah it tough to answer? and If you give me an answer? I not', 'sure I really know how your well is because I do know what you are referring to and what you including', 'in your answer? and what you excluding. So it ha a lot of the same characteristic, best quality of life,', 'along those same line and one of the concept that you had listed with', 'productivity how is that measured or different than health quality of', 'life, or potentially, what we might think of with well well I do know I', 'not involved in the productivity area So, much anymore, but when I wa reviewing advertising claim. that', 'were coming in to the FDA because company wanted to be able to go to an', 'insured population in this country, the population are insured by large', 'Corporation, for example, that are self so there a lot of drug', 'company that were would go to the self large company and say if', 'you use my drug your patient population is going to be more productive Because', 'their Health is going to be better is the implication And so how do you know that true well you start first, have to', 'know what may be their impact, the impact, of their disease on their daily life, and', 'functioning that could then, a a result. have an impact, on their productivity so', 'My point wa that you still have to know what those core disease defining concept, are first thank you and one', 'other question. that wa sent in wa how would I researcher a deal with comorbidities when attempting to develop,', 'a health quality of life, measure, or another type of measure, now. that a', 'very difficult thing to do because if you are talking about, a population with', 'a lot of comorbidities the patient, are not able even if they can to a Certain', 'degree.
