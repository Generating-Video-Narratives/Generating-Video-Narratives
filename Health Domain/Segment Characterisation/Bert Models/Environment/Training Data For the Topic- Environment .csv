Environment,"collaborating with a range of collaborating with a range of organizations , including Parks , Victoria g21 , the Austin hospital group in the city of Melbourne and I 'm Pleased to say that many of those stakeholders are in the room with us this evening and we 're delighted to welcome you here . Maddie 'S"
No," their elders , past and present , but perhaps even more importantly , for this this occasion , I 'd Like to pay my respects to the family of the late Peter quail , I did not have the privilege of knowing Peter if I may take the liberty of calling him by first name , and I know"
Environment," factor in our wellbeing is nature or the natural environment . There are two key ways in which the environment affects human health , through its quality and through its accessibility when the World Health Organization states that more than twentyfive"
Environment," percent of the world 's disease is attributable to environmental factors . It is referring to the quality of the environment in which people live or more particularly , to environmental degradation . For example , air pollution is responsible for approximately 3.3"
Environment," million deaths per year globally and 1.1 billion people worldwide live without access to clean water , but there is another aspect of the environment that is important for human health , its accessibility . Increasingly , it is being recognized that human health is"
No," nature may heal and cheer and give strength to body and soul alike . You might be forgiven for thinking that in bringing this quote to your attention , I 'm simply drawing attention to the threat posed to our access to green spaces by urban densification and urban"
No," patients from more than a hundred GP practices , found positive physical and mental health effects and increased physical activity associated with higher levels of proximal nature . This was true in children under 16 housewives , people from low SES areas and those under 65 in"
No," 2009 found that participants reported neighborhood green space was an important factor contributing to their positive mental health and in an Australian study , suvi armor and colleagues examined the links between perceived neighborhood , greenness and"
No, selfrated physical and mental health . They found that people who perceive their neighborhoods as very green had a 1.37 to 1.6 times greater likelihood of better physical and mental health respectively when compared with those who perceive their neighborhoods as
No," much more important than absolute poverty is relative deprivation or relative poverty , which is bad for health . That is being poorer than most people in society . The second is social explosion being excluded from access to the structures and resources of society"
No," based on racism , discrimination , stigmatization hostility and unemployment . Our Health Statistics paint a grim picture of the impacts of social exclusion , and here are so here 's some of the evidence . Indigenous people are less healthy diet , much younger ages have more"
No, disability and a lower quality of life . Economically disadvantaged Australians are more likely to have shorter lives . People with disability are more likely to have poor physical and mental health and higher rates of smoking and overweight and refugees also experience
Environment," health disadvantage . All of that from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare . It is an amusing image , is it not , but it is also telling it highlights the coming together of both the accessibility and quality of natural environments and which sector"
Environment," of the population is most likely to be denied access to good quality environments , those who are socially excluded . The poor , those with a disability , the indigenous the refugees , those with mental health problems . Some years ago I worked in public housing in"
No, with signs saying . Please keep off the grass and no ball games the people living in those council houses . The children especially had few other options for accessing green space and they were being denied what they needed for good health Trevor Hancock . A leading
Environment," health promotion expert from Canada suggests that three broad elements - the economic environment , the social or community environment and the natural and built environment must all come together in positive ways if human health is to be optimized . Basically , the"
Environment," physical environment needs to be viable for human existence in its range of temperatures , for example , it needs to be sustainable in the long term , and the built environment needs to be livable , such as having adequate green spaces . The economic environment needs to be"
Environment," adequately prosperous . On an environmentally and socially sustainable basis , with the benefits of this prosperity distributed equitably , the social environment or community needs to be convivial , that is to have appropriate"
Environment," support networks and to foster harmony and participation in community life . It needs to be livable to support conviviality and provide a viable human living environment , and it needs to be equitable characterized by fairness and justice . According to Hancock , it is only"
No," meridian hill Park . What is now a lovely area to visit , but at the time it was the scene of drug dealing and big own violence , crime and the like Steve and his friends would walk through the park at night and greet everybody . No matter what they were doing"
No," - politely hello , lovely evening - is n't it and of course drug dealers and people who are up to no good ? Don'T really want to be greeted like that , so very quickly , they moved out Washington parks and people has become a fantastic organization that has spread its work"
Environment," way beyond the meridian hill area , including this area surrounding Marvin Gaye Park . Marvin Gaye Park once used to be a place of community of pride and of leisure . It was the center of life in the local area . First decades of abandonment made it one of Washington DC 's , worse"
No," worst parks , not unlike low socioeconomic status areas in many cities , drug dealing and violence , compounded the neglect and environmental degradation to make it a place where children could no longer play and families no longer wanted to Go Steve decided he would begin by"
No," consulting the children in the local area as to what they might like in the park . They replied that they would like a farmers market , so Steve dutifully went off to the local council and asked if he could set up a farmers market . Oh no , no ! No , they said we ca n't have people"
No," selling things in parks and he said well . I'Ve been selling speed and heroin here be here , would you mind if we sold peas and potatoes instead , and so the children got their farmers market ? Washington , parkson people worked with the local community"
Environment," He employed Kenny you 'll , see a photo of Kenny shortly . Kenny is a local . He has lived all his life in the area that is , apart from the time he spent in prison . He came to work with Steve through a job training scheme and is now key people in the development adversary , a key person"
Environment," in the development , maintenance and monitoring of the park and the surrounding area . Kenny now has an assistant , another person who came through the same job training scheme , but there are also other jobs opening up in the area . Now that the park can be used"
No," for recreational purposes , there are opportunities for ice cream , vendors , soft drink sellers and the like , and with the broad community renewal that has been leveraged from the work of Washington , packs and people . Construction jobs have also opened up for the locals ; it is a"
No," ripple effect . What began with the response of four or five people to a driveby shooting at meridian hill has now transformed whole areas of Washington DC . The results , of course , are obvious . This is the old nightclub which has been renovated as a community hub in"
Environment," winter . The farmers market is held indoors because it 's too hold in the park , but the venue also has rooms for youth activities , a soup kitchen and the potential for community education . This is Kenny . I 'D stake a lot on the fact that he will never go back"
No," The job scheme member is now Kenny the manager and also Kenny the researcher in the area adjacent to the park . There has been a huge community renewal project , new housing , a new school being built , improved streets and the like . The park is now an attractive area and the"
No," restored nightclub building is a drawcard for tourists interested in the history of popular music . But it is not just renewal of buildings that the park is triggered . It is also contributed to enhanced cultural understanding , community revitalization , crime"
No," prevention , Civic empowerment , child development and improved social connections . While I was there , I met with a wonderful africanamerican elderly lady who runs from her own home , a support program for young single mothers . She teaches them about cooking , healthy"
No," meals , about parenting and she even provides an opportunity shop for them to buy or swap clothes for themselves and their children . All this arose from the original Washington parks and people initiative . Another woman in her 60s was showing Steven me around another class"
Environment," another Park . What 'S branch quite close by when we detected pollution in the stream flowing through the park in the part in the past , there would have been no one to take action on this . Once Steve became involved , he might have taken action , but now the action"
Environment," comes from the local people within minutes . This lady was on the mobile phone to the environmental monitoring agency , demanding that they come at once and take action to stop the pollution . It is an example of Trevor Hancock 's model in action . What about here in Australia"
No," work , do you tell the Deauville about the bastards who 've been bugging you or do you when you get frustrated , get out into the garden and dig as though your life depended on this project involved ? Taking a group of people who are suffering from anxiety and depression out into a park"
Environment," to work with members of a friends of park group in planting weeding plant propagation and the like by connecting the people into the group , we hope that their connection with that environment Would be more sustainable since they would have friends there . The project was"
No," controlled for other variables . They undertook ten or more hours of a range of nature based activities over a period of six to twelve weeks . Those activities were supported by the anger volunteers , the angle C and aireys inlet Society for the preservation of nature . I think"
No," identifying Nash , noxious , weeds and another commented that he had been able to participate , even when not well others reflected on the benefits for their mental health , their confidence and their sense of selfworth . By taking part in feel blue touch screen , I 've"
Environment," experienced happiness that I would otherwise have missed out on . I developed confidence in this supportive environment . They referring to the project , partners , Parks , Victoria , Alcoa and people in parks , foundation , offered gentle encouragement and were supportive"
Environment," , and they talked about being able to manage depression and they 're . Depressed mood being involved in feel blue touch . Green helps me to manage depression . We all know what that feels like get out there into the natural environment . You feel better . In 2007 , I collaborated with"
No," emotional state scale and you probably ca n't read the small writing there , but the only only parameter on which the results were worse after the activity than they were before was pain , and they actually thought that was terrific , because if they Were in pain , it meant"
Environment," they must have done something really energetic and worthwhile , and so they were happy about it . This is a picture taken from one of the days that we spent out in the natural environment . This is a group that was working on a project called Project Scotland , it involved"
Environment," young offenders and older people with mental health issues in working with forestry , UK forestry , Scotland , in dealing with drainage issues , noxious weed removal and the like in the West of Scotland . Just out of air , it provided skills , training , work , experience , social"
No," interaction and the possibility of employment . At the end , many of the participants had been on a oneway trip to nowhere and it spent much of their time involved in drinking drug abuse and petty crime . This program turned them around , and some of them talked to us ."
No," Young men talk to us about setting up your own business . They talked to us about the fact that their families were now proud of them . Instead of being ashamed of them , it was miraculous . This photo was taken during the same study , but this is in the lakes , this Lake"
Environment," District National Park , we spent a day in the Lake District , and there were four groups involved in volunteering all in the same activity . On the same day , people came from the environment agency , which was a government department , and they were using one of their two annual days"
Environment," that they could donate to charity . So they could use two days of their working year to work for an organization , a charitable purpose , and this group of people about eight of them had chosen to work on the environment . There were also people from the Lake District National"
No," Park . Volunteers , group group people from friends of the Lake District and a group of people from an organization called West house , which is a facility locally for people with developmental delays and disabilities . They work together for the day and we worked with them for the"
No," having one grassed area and that Being a sloping site , these are people in wheelchairs . For goodness sake , what are we thinking about in the way we develop , but there are . There are some green shoots . There are some positive examples of good things happening . The active in"
Environment," parks program in the bow and region parks , victoria , g21 , the Department of Health , the Department of Community , the Department of Planning and Community Development , the people & Parks , Foundation and midi bank private are partners in this program ."
No," Jackie daqui vut , the executive officer of the people in parks foundation - here is here and Elaine carbines from g21 and I 'm sure they 'd be very happy to talk to you about this in detail later . It 'S a program that works with health and community agencies to embed within their"
Environment," everyday practices and programs , access to green spaces and all the benefits that access can bring . Groups like diversity at the migrant Resource Center and pathways , which works with people with serious mental illness , are involved , and the people and Parks Foundation has"
Environment," asking if we could be involved in some research in academia . This area has become accepted . When i started at Deakin 17 years ago , they all thought I was a bit of a lunatic . What on earth is she talking about the environment ? For now they really get it in the health sector ."
No, Clearly they get it or I would n't be standing up here today and in the local communities . People clearly get it in fact they got it way before I did John Muir again what an amazing man he was . I only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown for
No," about the importance of accessibility to green spaces , but I 'm interested in the question of quality , particularly with regard to children 's development . Is there equal weight in living , a block away from , say our local football oval to ? I guess wild spaces or more interactive"
No," play spaces that are outdoors for children and how do you value the different types of green space ? There are ? There are important differences and we need football ovals and the like to encourage physical activity . We certainly need those , but in terms of children 's"
No," cognitive development , the availability of more natural green spaces within local communities is significant . So if children get out there into natural green spaces , there inquiring minds will prompt them to ask questions and they will learn problem solving skills and"
No," , large open spaces on which people can play sport , throw frisbees run and the like , as well as some natural or restored green space . That is an area where children will see the bugs and the birds and the bees around . If we have all three of those types of open space in every"
No," area , it will be optimal for children 's development . Think you 've got a comment , a question over here . It 'S a question : now you had the information up there going back quite a while talking about changes in society was saying living closely with animals"
Environment," and the environment . Things like that - and you said something about 250 since the last 250 years ago , and I did n't know the background - what changed socially that people . What was the big change 250 years ago that we can look and learn from well ? 250 years ago we began living in urban"
Environment," environments . The Industrial Revolution was the key there where people move from an agrarian society into large cities , and if you , you will have seen photos of the industrial Britain with the smog bound cities and houses built one on top of one another . The sewage running down"
No," the streets and the like it was an absolute disaster , but even where cities are clean , what has happened ? Is people have become separated from their dependence on nature ? We go to the shop , you know you ask children . Where does milk come from ? They say the supermarket"
No," the awareness Of children about where food comes from and what 's entailed in growing food , there was a very funny story in our evaluation that that an interview with one of the parents said that in a small rural school in Northwest Victoria , where the mother came"
No," home and found the Child ratting around in the pantry and said : what are you looking for and the child said , I 'm looking for the turmeric and the mother said . What 'S turmeric and what 's happened through this program ? Is that the children have been taught to use"
Environment," wonderful education hi , my name is Andrew Crowley , I 'm new to deacon in the sport recreation area in student life and one of the things that strikes me about the university . You'Ve got wonderful social capital here with all these students and wondering if there 's any examples of any"
Environment," research or any connections with students into the community on large scales from a student perspective to it , for their health as well being into the natural environment with ya and Working with community groups around those sorts of things right , I 'm Angela , we have had"
Environment," australian research council where we 're looking at engaging students from Deacon with the natural environment and measuring the impacts of that . So maybe hello , my name 's Ben I 'm . Just a member of the community as well um you touched on Stephanie Alexander 's program , which will"
No," was wondering , what you thought about , having a display of an actual community garden , not just 20 members who go down each week to the jaw and west community garden , but actually having A place which is more because people just do n't ever connect with their food anymore , and I"
No, was just wondering what your thoughts were on that . I think I think the idea of engaging the community in community gardens is fantastic . I'Ve had a number of students who have done studies of the benefits of community gardens and they are enormous
No," opportunity to engage in community gardening is really important , and I think it would be a fantastic idea to to have some displays about community gardens and the opportunities for them and to have the council promoting this , and I know that the council does this . I"
No," know that the council has supported several of the gardens that my students have studied , but to have this really promoted would be fantastic , because I think that many people are not aware even of the notion of a community garden . It it hacks back to the days of europe"
No," look at how this can be done . So talk to me . We do know that it 's actually in a voided health care costs . If you simply look at reduce mental health problems , increased physical activity , 1.5 billion dollars a year is incurred annually in Australia due to"
No," children 's cognitive development , but for their capacity to relate across the generations and for their problemsolving skills . So I think it 's a terrific idea in innercity schools , one of the problems is often space in the primary school where our children went"
No," you know that report highlights the the desperate lack of contact with nature that many of our Australian children have many children , could n't identify a waffle or a bottle brush had never been out into a natural Ashland space . So I think , given that that"
No," is the case , and many children spend so much time in front of a screen to have a wild nature area in every school would be an ideal way to to help balance . The ledger , if you like it 's Terry , Brooks I 'm here close friend of Peter quails . The london school of economics has done a"
Environment," that we look at all three of those intersecting circles , the community , the economics and the environment , and I think that that 's the only way to go . But I I ca n't say that I 'm familiar with that work , but I will certainly go away and look it up . Thank you for the hint ."
No, This is very quick um . Just I 'm a teacher . My name is . I was just wondering the study that you did in the UK with respect to the volunteers and forests . Mmhmm is that available or do we is ? Will there be a linker but um so that when we have our
No," new website up , which we hope will be within a matter of weeks , there will be a link to that report and you 'll be able to access it . But if , if you ca n't do that , contact me by email and I 'll happily send you a copy just to comment , i live in Geelong with two and in a suburb and"
No," community garden or parts , the actual public limited open space is becoming less and less . I ca n't comment on the area because I 'm not familiar with it . I would say that it 's true in most cities that there is an increased density of housing that spaces that were previously"
No," buildings within the city there and from all cultures , and they are so happy to meet each other via the dogs and we go now . We have dinner together and drinks together and and all the rest with our dogs , and I 'm just wondering if you 've done studies into thee , because the"
Environment," happy to we 're , always really happy when we run into each other exam , so I wonder , if they 've been any studies in regard to not only the environment that actual park space , but also to the animals in our environment And the way that , like some of these people as I can hardly see"
No," , there has been research done on pets and their benefits for health and and my own experience as the the owner of two dogs is that I 've Met and made friends with local people , whom I would never have known . Otherwise . I always say that you know when you walk through a park with a"
No," the people would sit around and Pat the rabbits and guinea pigs and cats and dogs and so forth . And there was one particular lady who was relatively new to the facility who refused to come out of her room , who felt that her family adductor in the aged care facility - and"
No," animals and that broke that the ice for Her and she became integrated then into that aged care facility community . So I think that it 's absolutely true and the evidence base from empirical research will show you pets , relieves stress and promote social"
Environment," examples , I I 'm very excited to look at the green shoots and how they develop over time and I 'm hoping that we 'll see more green shoots . As a result of this presentation , I 'd like you to join me in thanking Marty in the gym . You"
No," vice president of the indus institute and anyway she is an urban Artwork expert as well . Thank you , hello , good morning . It 'S a pleasure to be here . I hope you heard me it 's the sound ! It 'S okay , it 's okay ! I hope so so it 's nice to be"
No," here . It 'S a very , very nice opportunity not only to discuss the topic , but also to promote interchange about uh practices . That will be very important in the next . I hope in the next years , but especially in the next"
No," individuals about the relation between uh , of course , between green spaces and physical and mental health , but the third 45 parts , it 's near , say to discuss this with the relation with planning the impact in the"
No," have a park or to have a children playing area or to have something . A private , a private , green area in the time of use and the target groups are quite different and naturally the impacts and"
Environment," health cities perspectives . Some other are more linked to an environmental general environment perspective . In any case , when you look at the work or the the the report about uber and green spaces"
No," to transform in our cities are quite different . When we look at picture one picture four feature : five , one , the other ones . So this typology is something that we must thinking because um it 's a possible one , but it 's something we must think in the"
No," , for example , related with the topic of children with the target group of children . We know also that green spaces since the beginning have specific allergens and bacterias , and that helps too"
No," to the children to get more immunization for the future . So there are some aspects that we feel we understand directly because we have been discussing in the last 10 20 years , but some other ones"
No," that are news and we could reforce it and are also also important to physical , physical condition , mental health benefits we during covid . We have"
No," uh and also social creation , and that improves also the sense of community um . Of course , this is a real difficult to measure , but when we look to this picture of the gardening , we see three groups of age , so we see"
No," environmental protection , we see physical activity , so we see social context . Okay , we see valorization of the the territory and also some understanding and some focus on trust of the community ."
No," kind of objective , objective of improved social capital or social creation in the community , but some matures least some adverse association with green spaces"
Environment," , allergic disease rate of infections . Some talk about security , because some of these green spaces are related with the toxic codependency place of crime , so animate also an im . A bad image of a bad frequency in some hours of the day"
Environment," physical outdoors practice , less pollution , less noise , more social context , the general one list , and then we think that have more Physical and mental health - and that goes to lead us to more"
No," that is terrible for for some of families , especially families that increase in size with children under 18 years old . They are not selfsufficient , so the time the free time they have to practice or to have some"
Environment," the effects of green spaces that we plan . That could be not i 'm not defending passive people , but we should think that environment in general , green environment in general could help people that do n't have so"
Environment," green spaces , but it 's the question of security . Okay , if you go to green spaces outside in some countries on some areas like in mexico in brazil , you have fear so the question of security insurance"
No," was more outside . So that is very important to to know , because we need , as a planners , to understand which kind of families and people in time we have to integrate some of the orientations"
No," to improve the impact of the orientation so to get more impacts . We have to put green spaces close to people , naturally , availability , accessibility , visibility . I respect very important to this ."
Environment," We have to adapt this to diverse demands . We have to improve the comfort , because it 's very important , if you have all people you need to have support for go to wc 's and this kind of of safety . We use uh in this kind of"
Environment," then we look at it . Maybe school environment we can link it with uh young people , public parks with organized sport activities , and then we can combine things of social , of course in sport , gardening , integrated"
No," very important , depending if you use the english system . Sustainable community or intelligent city or ish , friendly city or green , the support the frameworks they did idea the principles we must integrate it and it 's very"
No," important to consider that different levels of organization and different entities are linked in this process . So , let 's , let 's think about what is sustainable mobility . Sustainable mobility in this"
Environment, impact in health also not only impacting the environment but also impacting health and more wellbeing . So it 's the way you want what we want to attend and that help us to redefine
No," combines uh the mobility . You can go by by bike or you can to the next train stations , or it combines also with um proximity , uh parks . This is a more distant area"
Environment," for environment but for health and social investment , and that helped us to justify the efficiency of the project and the discussion of the relevance of the project in the city . Finally , now you have this"
Environment," challenge about sustainable development goals . 11 is directed , but there are others like to reduce inequalities or the questions regarding linkage to environment or even gender equality , because"
No," , and all the other sectors could contribute to this , not only for thinking in investment and but also to think in the impact impact system of indicators . We are going to have"
No," , and thank you very much i do n't know will be in the next future . I hope it is in the right and not in the left or close . I did n't get it at home . Thank you"
No," many communities , and it is no coincidence that these are often in neighborhoods in our towns and cities , with poor green space provision . Now , i 'd like to introduce our speakers"
Environment," first , i 'd like to welcome valerie gladwell good morning , valerie valerie is the course director for the sport and exercise science degree at the university of essex . Her main research interests include physical activity"
Environment," and the natural environment . The importance of green space is for promoting physical activity , behavior change and workplace wellbeing . Next , i would like to welcome luke engelbeck good morning . Luke luke is a chartered landscape , architect"
No," important and the value of that and for our wellbeing and as jane alluded to particularly at this um this challenging time , so i 've put it in this place of workplace wellbeing . I do appreciate"
No, it does come with the downsides um and it increases our stress levels . It does some that leads to decreasing our mental wellbeing and can also lead to our decrease in in physical health . What this leads to is a decrease in
No, It restores our levels of attention for concentration and it reduces our blood pressure and boosts our immune function . So that sounds like it 's . A very positive and powerful resource and wellbeing can kind of
No," give so volunteering , and things also help by keeping learning and and um kind of stretching ourselves also is good for our wellbeing and also am taking notice . So how does nature all fit into that ?"
Environment," , if you 're in a more natural environment and one of The experiments we did , people actually talk more , they actually engage more so that connection is there um in terms of taking notice . You know just looking at this picture and taking notice of the shape of the leaves or"
Environment," university of essex has kind of encompassed that importance of physical activity and the green space together , and we coined this term back in 2003 . And it 's it 's green exercise where you kind of put put the two together"
Environment," , you 'd all have to stand so by um changing what what the environment is . It changes our our behavior and shapes our behavior , so we need to think about that when potentially um designing um those green spaces , what is"
Environment, it that we 're actually looking for ? Is it that we 're looking for them to gain nature by taking part in exercise or we 're kind of trying to change their behaviors by being in that natural environment ?
No," that it actually boosts your mood and selfesteem . So actually it does n't take very long to get a benefit and actually when they , they did a kind of um gathered loads and loads of different data from"
Environment," um , we got them to watch um , just a video um , because we wanted to control the conditions . So it 's a video of a natural environment or a video of um of more built environments and what we found that when we gave them"
Environment," environment or a um , a green environment just around the university of um essex , and we then looked to see what their sleep was afterwards and we were measuring um . What was going on in terms of their control"
No," of their heart , and we basically could determine from this , that their quality of street sleep seemed to improve um if they 'd walked around the green walk compared to if they 'd walked around the blue walk"
Environment," , bristol and um chelmsford , and it was a a walking program where we got them to walk for eight weeks and either um in a nature , environment or a built environment . We had prescribed roots that they were meant to walk"
No," for those that went for the um nature walks . They decreased their blood pressure , they decreased their perceived stress and they increased their mental health . It also seemed to increase the adherence those those people who were in the green"
No, space around work is that there 's a whole community that maybe you can pull together and use what we call social norming that actually it 's normal to go out . So remember i mentioned the line manager . You know if the line manager was
Environment," involved . It was more likely that his um , the people under him or her actually went out and did the exercise . So we want sustained behavior change . So what can we do ? Well um ? This is actually um a diagram from um sport , england"
No," , um about active design . I 'M sure most of you will have seen this , but it 's about awareness , the immunity and accessibility . So how do we translate it ? Well , it needs to be of high quality , some of the work that we were um doing for the nhs um . They were"
Environment," enhances that wellbeing as well and then it 's just those places to be able to connect and and and be together . So if you want more information , we have a website at our university around green exercise"
Environment," , and for me that means taking a step back and seeing our planet on its own in space and houston . We have a problem um we 're right in the middle of a climate and biodiversity emergency , and it 's up to us to choose the future"
Environment," , my apologies there we go . Is that all right ? That 'S super ! Thank you ! Thank you . So we have 44 less land providing for each person , and this may well be eroded further with climate change and biodiversity loss"
No," In a variety of ways , there are direct health effects in terms of floods or heat waves . There are ecosystem , mediated health effects in terms of things like covid , altered infectious"
No," disease off of decreased food yields or effects on mental health and then indirect , deferred or deplete displaced health effects in terms of loss of livelihood , population displacement , uh conflict and so forth . The thing is"
Environment," That 'S about 477 , 000 kilometers off them . A massive loss in ecosystem infrastructure and networks damaged the planet damages human health and there are a series of threats , whether it 's climate change , biodiversity , nutrition , water use or soil degradation"
No," , the evidence base is growing all the time and these cover ecosystems , biodiversity , physical and mental health And now it 's looking into the microbiome , we may experience or augment by being in touch with nature"
No," beautiful . Natural capitalism is often monetized for comparison , but it does n't have to be . There is intrinsic value too um . Kate roweth has done an interesting uh book about donut economics"
Environment," transformative change will be needed to achieve it . So we 've got 10 years to sort out climate change , biodiversity loss , human health and wellbeing they 're all linked , and we have something to do to to say and to to contribute towards"
Environment," helping towards these things . It will be a challenge , and maybe we are the next key workers . We need a whole systems approach , a landscapeled , ecourbanism places , people environment first"
Environment," taking a natural capital approach , investing in maintenance and renewal of existing places , um highest standards for green space , looking at climate change and so forth . The solutions that we need have to"
No," energy , water and biodiversity and do it through interconnected and multifunctional networks . Um urban density can allow proximity to wildlife . This is the greenwich millennium . Village uh had a design i did for the eco park"
No," buildings are covered . Uh with something . That 'S doing something for nature , whether it 's on the roof or on the walls . Ecosystem services are essential infrastructure and we need to start thinking about how"
Environment, really big issue and the coded lockdown earlier this year made it completely plain why we need to rethink this nitrous oxides . Particle and noise pollution are really serious problems in urban areas .
Environment," The particle pollution contains micro plastics from road tires , but also heavy metals for from brakes tires and road pain , chromium , copper , zinc , nickel and lead . So even when the uh diesel and petrol cars have been phased out , we will still have have those from"
Environment, in paris . They have retrofitted a major arterial route by taking out two lanes of traffic and replacing them with greenery to separate vehicles from pedestrians and provide a filter . Curbside planting also can attenuate a
Environment, very large amount of black carbon and a fair amount of pm 2.5 . Whether it is as a low hedge or planting or rain gardens green surface transport corridors also do the same thing . A lot of iron filings are coming off contact with with
Environment," rails . It also helps with reducing heating dealing with surface water and reducing noise , healthier green streets . In a variety of ways can be planned or retrofitted and really improve"
No," , we could use vertical raid gardens if there is n't space for rain gardens on the street . We should also create opportunities for community activities in green spaces , whether it 's growing food or just having an event ."
No," We need to green childhood and getting hands dirty . The global health institute in barcelona did a study to show that children brought up regardless of economic circumstance in greener , as against greater"
No," circumstances , had better working memory and better cognition . This is also when your microbiome is starting to to to embed between years , one and ten . So this is a time to actually get your"
Environment," pounds in avoided cost to the nhs , and this is something which also should promote a reason for why we should green our cities , we 're familiar with the three r 's , But these are the three e 's environment"
Environment," , equality and economy . The most important is environment , because it 's the foundation of everything else , david attenborough , said recently . We are part of natural systems and if we want to save ourselves"
Environment," same time , we can increase biodiversity and and all the stuff that that does in terms of combating the climate crisis and the biodiversity collapse that we 're threatened with , so that photograph is actually linked to the Glasgow project that i"
Environment," um in an existing Park , which is this it 's a small fivehectare local park uh that was created around a la uh , a lake and a park , was built in the 80s . So we sort of found we have this mature or reasonably mature green environment"
No," extended this uh project , this monitoring for two further years , so i 'd be really interested to see how the numbers hopefully go up over the years and how more more and more people in the community"
No, of an extra back water of a canal of the canal system in glasgow and they scraped it out . And used the clay from there to line the rest of the canal system and then just fenced it off . So it 's it
No," became fantastically biodiverse , um , a kind of rich piece of green land , but it also acted as a massive barrier between sort of four or five discrete residential communities , all with with sobering statistics in terms of deprivation and health . Poor"
No," here you can see a plan View which is a bit more helpful , so the the top of the hill is up here . This is a big estate , another big highrise estate , another community . Here sorry , i ca n't remember all the names"
No," endeavor to get this project off the ground and very much the community um led to begin with , but we put in a public path down a spine path down here , which at least connected this bridge here . Can you see my cursor yeah great ? So there 's a bridge across"
No," here and then you walk through here up the steep side and it connected up to these communities here . So suddenly , these people could get down here through a beautiful natural path . What 'S just happened now"
No," and enables these other neighborhoods to connect um . As i said , there was a huge kind of threeday charette at the beginning of this process , a few years back , which meant that the community was the communities because there was about 100 ."
No," to show you next , where the clay was taken out from that they 've turned into this lovely watery bit now with uh boardwalks . There 'S a community here as well , which now has access um , so that was the the nature reserve that"
No," duncan , drew this on for me to tell me which bits had just been done . So what you 're looking at here on the right is the link to the community here , um and then in front of you . These boardwalks"
No," fairly deprived community um and it 's all accessible , and i guess the the thing is that obviously covid has done . Is it 's made all of our worlds ? Much smaller uh we 're all very , very keenly aware of what our very"
No," of west to come , and this is your garden um , the one on the right someone 's taking their child um for a walk . This one saying a joy to use with a mobility scooter more to explore when energy permits . You"
No," know again my mum 's recovering from various operations , and it 's telling her that you have you know it 's knowing that you can go slightly further , each time and slowly build up , and just by going once you get the strengths to go again and"
No," is is , is a huge thing and then a person on the right here uh . My new favorite thing again that starts speaking to ownership as these two uh communities taking ownership , the communities are taking"
No, trying to kind of educate people um as well about those spaces and we 're thinking that more by more biodiversity is important for both health and wellbeing . But i think also luke 's point . You know
Environment," also helping with with the other issues around climate change , yes and luke . I think you also brought in uh the comments that david attenborough uh made and , of course , at our awards , uh ceremony yeah . He said that , if we 're going to"
No," We forget that we are each a walking ecosystem and i interviewed a professor alistair woodward in auckland a couple of years ago about his work uh , where he talked about encountering microbial old friends"
No," on our health and even our mood and mental health , so uh the what i 'm reading now is that , if you can bolster that , especially In the early years - and this is what dr um dave dad van hood had done"
Environment," - uh in in barcelona was looking at a big cohort of of children to see how they got on whether they were , regardless of economic status , doing better in green or grey we 're . Starting to see a whole new level"
Environment," of of reasons for getting in touch or brushing past nature , in addition to um the whole very important thing about exercise , um and relaxing , so it is actually even more important than"
Environment," yeah yeah , i 'm . I am a big fan of of forcing people 's hands through legislation um , but i think the the co benefits uh are so evident . I'Ve got quite i 'm quite excited about the environment bill at the moment , um"
No," 106 and still does go some way to legislating the community benefit , but i think i would be a massive uh supporter of a single piece of legislation that just threaded these things together and"
Environment," sociologist and an expert on the social environment and how that impacts . Health , the field of behavioral sciences have some of the key answers to some of the major crises that the United States faces in terms of health . My name is David Williams . My work is looking at"
Environment, access to green spaces and to parks and to safe places to walk low income ? Americans are three times more likely to die before the age of 65 than highincome Americans . My earliest work started out looking at any qualities and health in terms of socioeconomic
Environment," inequalities in health . Why does health vary by income and education ? Occupational status and many people do n't realize this , but the gaps in health in the United States by income and education are larger than the gaps in health by race ."
Environment," people determines where you go to school . The quality of elementary and high school education and the quality of education then determines your access to quality , higher education , which determines your access to quality jobs , which determines"
Environment," every resource within society generally , even when we look at blacks and whites or Latinos at the same levels of income or education , this still is a residual effect of race . So race still matters , then at every level of education and income , and that led to the question : what"
No," life in the places where Americans spend most of their time , our homes , our workplaces , our schools , our Neighborhoods our communities and if we can develop a culture of health where we can make the Healthy Choice , the easy choice , we can put the United States on a path"
No," experience in their daily lives , based on a variety of factors , certainly could be based on race or ethnicity could be based on , culture could be based on religion could be . Gender based there are could be a sexuality based really to homophobia and other sorts of issues . So"
No," terms of physical health , as well as being just a more free and fair social structure . It 'S actually improves health outcomes . That 'S pretty remarkable how you can imagine , as you sort of look at this list , that one of the things I think of - and I look at a list like this - is"
No," that one of the functions of these sorts of experiences upon people is that it sends a Subtle message that individuals perhaps are not fully welcome , they may are not fully part of a community or a group , and one of the things we know is that humans are social animals"
Environment," want to turn now sort of away from the social aspect of it and look more at the purely environmental impacts on Hill . Looking at things like our physical environment , what is sometimes called the built environment . Environmental impact certainly include the quality of water"
Environment," and air weather patterns . Population density , climate change is an issue that affects health . We'Re all certainly aware that the safety cleanliness of our water and our air is an impact on our environment , but one of the things - that 's really interesting , i think , is an"
Environment," emerging science that focuses upon this idea of the built environment on health outcomes . What this is talking about is the way we lay out our towns , the cities , the way we make things available at green spaces or walking in bike trails or whether or not we make it possible"
No," for people to walk , to work and to church and to the Store or if we require people to travel , long distances on train or cars to get places those have impacts on our health , we 're going to turn next to another one of these short videos that will highlight some work , that 's being"
Environment," looked at a very broad range of environmental factors but environment in a very broad sense , and not just the physical environment which we have traditionally looked at in health for a long time like air pollution , but also things about"
Environment, the ways of these communities are built . On ways in which attract with each other things about social environment and all these things that actually trickle down through multiple different pathways and affect people and ultimately affect their
Environment," health , one in the project that we have focuses on how neighborhoods and local communities affect cardiovascular risk . We know that cardiovascular disease is a strongly patterned by socioeconomic factors . People of lower education , for example , have substantially higher"
Environment," cardiovascular disease risk , so understanding why that is , helps us understand the causes of cardiovascular disease at everybody and tries to look at the environments in which people live and and how those environments affect the development and maintenance of"
Environment," access . The physical environment includes things like whether there is access to different kinds of resources , healthy foods , recreational facilities , parks , levels of safety and violence and crime . To what extent people feel connected to others in their neighborhood"
Environment," neighborhoods , and then we have the income of the neighborhood , affecting the quality quality affecting health and then health affecting income , and so that creates this kind of feedback that we 're interested in . Seeing the red houses means unhealthy households and blue"
Environment," go to work , they have to shop , they have to socialize , and here rich people which environment and they make decisions about how they 're gon na Travel to these places , and they have environments that they walk through , for example , at effects , what they do next"
No," time and how much people walk also affects what happens in the neighborhood . In some ways , I think the work that we do seeks to provide . You know rigorous scientific evidence for the importance of these things and with the hopes that they will be translated into into"
Environment," unhealthy households tend to cluster . And what would happen if you change those neighborhoods so that walking was more available or perhaps more required in the way that impacts health ? That 'S all about looking at this , this aspect of sort of the built environment . What 'S"
Environment," of the the biggest widest view analysis here . This would include things like the natural environment , the topography and the water supply in the area in which you live includes . What they call macro social or big social factors like are you a member of a minority group ? Do you"
Environment," intermediate or mezzo or community . This is where we look at things like your built environment , like how is the town laid out ? How is a neighbourhood laid out what 's available nearby ? Is it a safe place to to walk , and also the social context of that particular community ? Is"
Environment, it safe ? Are there capacity or is it ? Is it overcrowded or is there place for people to live more easily with the quality of education available in that community ? We then moving to the right . We get more and more sort of personal and a closer up view . So we look at the
No," proximate or micro interpersonal level . What kind of stressors are in people 's lives ? What kind of health behaviors are available to engage in and what do they engage in and , lastly , how socially integrated is that is a community ? Are there opportunities for people to"
No," ideal community in the term of in terms Of social integration and support and , lastly , are sort of the the outcomes , the health and wellbeing outcomes . So we can look at health outcomes like infant health , low birth weight . We can look at mental health , use of substances , the"
No," presence of disease but , on the other end , there 's optimal wellbeing , which is more than just The absence of a disease process , it 's really about people , satisfied and happy and functioning in a maximal level in their life . So this is as a model that people who look at"
Environment," who 's , a famous health psychologist out of UCLA . This is her model of how exactly does environment influence health , how does one 's environment sort of get into the body and affect health , and this sort of lays out what some of those causes might be if we start at the top with"
Environment," aspects of the environment ? Well , one of things we know that that contributes to is the the presence of more or less chronic stress to the effect that there 's chronic stress that affects people 's emotions , their affect and what we might think of as their mental health ."
Environment," Their experience of things like depression or anxiety , to the extent that people experience that it then affects their coping strategies . If people live in highly stressful , highly challenging environments , it can really maximize the load of their coping strategies and they"
Environment," , we talked about the mediators , this is Shelly Taylor 's model of stress , effective response , coping strategies and health habits as the set of mediators that mediate between one 's environment and how healthier and healthy it is , and the ultimate biological health"
No," One of the most common tasks you may be asked to perform will be helping someone move from one place to another . As a care assistant , you will be instructed trained and tested on a variety of types of mobility , assistance for a variety of disabilities and other access and"
No," feet shoulderwidth apart and we 're going to lift on the count of three . You ready one two three : if the client is using an assistive device for walking , make sure it is positioned properly the clients mobility device . In this case , a walker should be"
No," within 2 minutes if the dizziness does not pass or gets worse or if the client becomes sweaty or short of breath or if the client is in any pain , help the client to lie back down and report . Your observations to health services"
Environment," Adjust equipment is needed to ensure stability and safety , clean up your area , wash your hands and report and record hi , I 'm Keisha . How are you oh hi , Keisha , I 'm Jonathan how 're , you doing I 'm doing well . Thank you , Jonathan nice to meet . You , too , can I do"
Environment," Class hello and welcome to this advanced practice in health and social care session on the quality of life . I will be your tutor big owl . Today we are going to look at what is meant by quality of life , psychological factors , nutrition and exercise , physical safety and hygiene ."
No, Let 'S first look at what quality of life means . People perceive many different things when they think about the quality of life . People will have different ideas and value systems in helping them to determine which factors they think are important when looking at their quality
No," of life . This can also vary between people of different ages , gender , social status and cultural beliefs . A person 's quality of life can depend on their physical surroundings and psychological wellbeing . For example , quality of life may be affected by not having adequate"
No," housing and enough food , but will also include their emotional state and personal life . Factors such as having a good network of friends and family may make a person feel safe and supported , thereby enhancing their psychological wellbeing . Therefore , quality of life may"
Environment," developing our own selfesteem and confidence below is a list of factors that can impact on a person 's psychological wellbeing . Occupation stimulation , effective communication , choice , autonomy , equitable treatment , social contact , social support approval"
Environment," , privacy , dignity confidentiality , psychological security , occupation , training for work is now a prominent feature in industrialized societies . In the UK there are numerous agencies services available to support people to gain employment . There is also an"
Environment," increase in vocational training being offered by colleges and apprenticeships . Quality of employment can vary from positive and pleasure to negative experiences , which can impact on psychological wellbeing in different ways . For example , low pay , poor working"
Environment," conditions and job satisfaction can lead to an individual to feel demotivated to work , low , selfesteem and overall have a negative impact on their wellbeing , in contrast , a job with good prospects where there is opportunity for training to further skills and promotion . This may"
Environment," those would better access a better wellbeing . Access can come from work like activities , leisure and general social interaction . It is important to remember that how people can define quality of life will vary from one individual to another . Recent"
Environment," their basic needs of food , shelter and so on , money does relatively little to improve happiness , that further increases in personal income do not tend to have much effect on changes in the personal happiness of citizens . There are other factors in the wider community that"
Environment," include the level of education needed to obtain a job . Consumer needs , poverty and social exclusion . War and political unrest may cause the infrastructure of a country to be unstable . This can impact on people 's lives . For example , people may need to evacuate their own country and"
Environment," look for refuge in other areas or different countries for their own safety . Environmental factors include the spread of infectious diseases , poor sewage systems and poor availability of water , lack of resources within a community and poor medical care due to the conflicts"
No," caused by war . Many of these factors are interlinked and will therefore impact on each other , depending on the event . What about food ? Surely , if a person has a poor diet , this will affect their quality of life because it can affect their health , that emotional wellbeing and so on . Yes"
No," , that 's a good point . Good nutrition is important for everyone , depending on people 's circumstances . They may need to focus more on their diet at different stages of their life . Healthy and nutritious diets are important in the growth and development of children . A"
Environment," balanced diet from a young age not only helps in children 's physical development , but also intellectually , to help them to do well in their education through all stages of life . A healthy diet can benefit everybody , for example , during pregnancy . Women may take in additional"
No," vitamins and minerals such as folic acid , to ensure that the right nutrients are passed on to the baby and help with their growth and development . Another example is in old age . Elderly people must be careful where their diets to prevent problems such as osteoporosis ."
Environment," high blood cholesterol . A healthy diet can also provide people with more energy and also boost people 's selfconfidence . How important is exercise ? I read an article . This head exercise can help improve your mood . Is this true ? Yes , exercise has been found to have many"
Environment," benefits . We need to care and maintain our bodies , not just by a balanced diet , but also by doing exercise . Exercise can include walking , running housework and anything that increases the heart rate . If people do not do any exercise and eat more calories than the body needs , this"
Environment," anorexia place themselves in high risk of fractures and developing osteoporosis . Benefits of exercise can include reduction of stress , weight , balance , reduced risk of chronic diseases , increase in selfesteem and confidence , improvement of cardiovascular function"
Environment," , yfx can the environment in which we live . Have it is important that people feel safe in their surroundings , such as their own home , where they can complete daily living tasks in a clean and secure environment ? The condition of the home can impact on a person 's safety and"
Environment," wellbeing . For example , children under the age of two and younger are not able to understand and recognize many dangers that threaten their physical safety . Parents must take measures to keep babies and young children safe from everyday hazards , both inside and outside"
No," of the home . If an individual 's home was very dirty and messy , this could be hazardous . If there are lots of items left lying around as the personal child could trip or four , if there is a lot of litter and rotten food left the decay in a home , this could"
Environment, preparation of food . It is important that food is prepared and cooked properly if basic food practices are not met . This could put people at risk of illness such as food poisoning . It is important for a person to feel physically comfortable in their surroundings and environment that
Environment," they feel safe and secure . A person may feel physical discomfort , for example , if they are too hot or too cold or if their environment is too noisy . These factors could impact on a person 's social and emotional wellbeing , as well as their physical , physical discomfort may be"
Environment," caused from feeling pain or ill health , such as from a skin , irritation or cold , which impacts on a person 's ability to focus on work or sleep . Material causes of ill health , such as living conditions , working conditions , housing , transport , environmental hazards and stress can"
Environment," also impact on a person 's ability to feel physically comfortable in their own environment . These factors are often seen from occurring with an individual 's social structure and environment . For example , the condition of an individual 's home could make a person feel physical"
Environment, discomfort if there was no heating and they felt constantly cold . Physical comfort is particularly important in health and social care settings for clients who are unable to control their own environment care . Workers should try to ensure that the clients there caring
No," for are able to be physically comfortable . In order to achieve this , the care worker may try to minimize any discomfort . This could be ensuring they are able to rest in their beds comfortably making sure they have enough pillows , using pressure , reducing aids"
Environment," importance of diet and nutrition , how our living environment affects quality of life , goodbye class and good luck."
No," useful framework to understand it . Take a look around you , your family friends and other people around you what 's clear is that health is quite variable not just between individuals , but also across different population groups ."
No," Let 'S take an example . In 2015 , the life expectancy of a child born in sierra leone was 50 years , whereas in australia it was 83 years a difference of 33 years , but there are differences , even within countries , for example in australia . The life expectancy of indigenous people is"
Environment," about 10 years lower than that of nonindigenous people within a population . Health is also influenced by social status . People with higher income , a higher level of education and a better occupation , have better health and a greater life"
No," individual factors such as age , sex and genetic makeup , and also what they do . This includes their health behaviors , such as smoking , physical activity , alcohol use and diet . Health is also largely influenced by the conditions in which people are born , grow live work and"
No," age . These include their social and community networks , the socioeconomic , cultural and environmental conditions that people live in and also health systems . These are collectively called the social determinants of health ."
No," decisions , economic , social and public policies , and also the social and cultural values that communities place on health . These factors can determine and lead to the unequal distribution of material and monetary resources , which shapes a"
Environment," factors such as education , occupation , income , gender race or ethnicity and social class . The socioeconomic position in turn affects the intermediary determinants of health . These include material circumstances like the quality of"
Environment," housing , the financial means to buy healthy food , clothing or other requirements for healthy living and also the work environment . Psychosocial circumstances like stressful living circumstances , relationships and social support , behavioral and biological"
No, Social cohesion and social capital are factors that bridge the structural and intermediary determinants . They describe the willingness of people living in a community to make sacrifices and to cooperate with each other for a wider benefit
Environment," intermediary determinants influence health and health inequities . It 'S also important to know that the links between these different factors are not always linear , but are complex and can go in both directions . For example , poor income and education can"
Environment," impact health and also poor health can limit opportunities for people to participate in the workforce or receive education . Also , if population is affected by a lot of disease , it can have a broader impact on the socioeconomic and political"
Environment," impact or main influence on our health is pollution . Now pollution can come in a long ways . We'Ve got outdoor pollutants and indoor pollutants outdoor pollutants . Will be traffic fumes , industry smoke and pollution , pesticides , commercial waste"
No," and bacteria and carbon Monoxide , these will be pollutants that have an impact on the body . The main impact of the pollutants would be respiratory disorders like bronchitis , asthma , emphysema or lung cancer . Cardiovascular"
Environment," problems like artery , blockage , heart attacks , and it can be linked to allergies like wheezing , rashes and allergy reactions . But what i found to just talk about exams , exam papers when they ask about the impact or the influence of pollution on"
No," , so these can be short term and long term , so poor ventilation and damp in the home that can lead to mold and respiratory issues . Overcrowding in the home can lead to anxiety , depression and the spread of illness . Lack of heating"
Environment," can cause hyperthermia and a lack of outdoor space means you ca n't do any exercise and that can also then influence or lead to cardiovascular issues and , lastly , poor sanitation . This does overlap a little bit with the spread of illness"
Environment," availability . So , where people live in location to geographical area , they may be far away from services or lack access to support . There may be no transport . The opening types of services may not be so uh to meet their needs ."
No," have a role here , so mobility , restrictions , learning or communication barriers . Awareness of the availability of help and also personal life issues like providing care work can also provide a barrier to care"
No," , and then we have social and i 've got to put cultural factors . In with this now , social factors focuses on the role of the family , the social interactions we have and some cultural influences and how these affect"
No," our health . The first one of these is dysfunctional families . Now a dysfunctional family is a family that does not do its job . Is not doing this job properly , it is dysfunctional , so members may not perform their function ."
No," Members display negativity towards one another . There could be sibling rivalry and conflict abuse , and all of this could be caused by parental upbringings . If parents have been brought up in dysfunctional families"
No," , they 're more likely to have them themselves , they 've been mental illness issues . Alcohol and drug abuse also have a role to play . The effect of dysfunctional families on health could be stress . It can lead to isolation , health issues , guilt , psychological harm"
No," and mental health issues and drug and alcohol use , so they can affect our health um as a result of being involved in these dysfunctional families . Parenting style has a role to play in"
No," this and there are lots of different types , so you 've got supportive , unsupportive , demanding and undermining . So if you have a supportive demanding parent , they 're , authoritative , the children , often um have high selfcontrol"
No," high selfesteem and are confident supportive , undemanding , sorry , demanding and unsupportive at least authoritarian parents . So poor social skills , low , selfesteem , undemanding and supportive means that children are"
No," selfconfident , they 're impulsive and they may have difficulty making friendships and then disengaged and uninvolved parents are undermining unsupported and the children have low confidence ."
Environment," Selfesteem and poor attachment . Bullying also has a role , causes stress , withdrawn from social activities and education , anxiety , eating disorders , selfharm , stress and poor achievement and in religion , and culture also has a"
Environment," Okay , welcome guys this is a review of the roles of organizations in Health and Social care , particularly looking at all the different places in which care is provided not to the role that performs in providing care very similar to what you may have looked at . In section . A"
Environment," body , because it is a public health care setting , it is accessible for everyone publicly and freely um , but as sort of the charity status also means they get contributed . Money contributed free Charity donations , social care bodies are more about your"
Environment," Council and it is the social care element . So it 's your um Child Services . It 'S your adult learning , Support Services . It 'S you know financial support , housing support . It might be uh resources to help people maintain their independence to live at"
Environment," home on their own . So these are the services that are provided by social care agencies . Now , if we break these uh public and social care bodies into two kind of roles , so the Public Health bodies like the NHS"
No," Foundation , trust they will run the hospitals . They provide Mental Health Services , child health services . They will partner with other organizations to maintain a medical and kind of healthcare related Focus in the people they serve ."
Environment," Local authorities do very much the same they 're serving the community , but this is more about the social care . It 'S nonmedical it 's more about supporting Independence , helping people live independently and they will work with other organizations , so they 'll work"
No," you 're referred on to them . So you 've binged your GP they 've , made an assessment . They'Ve recognized a health issue . They will send you to that setting for more treatment , so that might be sending you to a hospital to see a consultancy . A specialist get further"
No," to an even more experienced specialist . So someone specializing in a particular injury or it might be a type of treatment . You need and that 'll be your tertiary health care provider and last but not least , we 've got primary sorry , private and voluntary . So we 've"
Environment," Social care . So in terms of health care , you might see things like boot per virgin health care or private sector doctors . They are providing health care for a fee . You also get private residential settings , so that could be nursing homes , residential homes , maybe"
Environment," even paying for counseling services . If you ca n't access them through the public health bodies , the voluntary sector is slightly different . That 'S your Charities that perform Health and Social care support So Healthcare . You know MacMillan cancer"
Environment," , nurses or married Curie nurses . They are providing health care , but they 're paid for through charitable work . Social care , mind bernardos , mencap , the Charities that provide a lot of social care , support , people , learning difficulties or other health conditions ."
No," you 're saying um someone with a mental health problem , they might go to uh , you know see your mental health specialist at a hospital or they might be sent to the psychiatric ward of a hospital or they Might go to a clinic which would be a mental health"
Environment," It 'S temporary , it 's about stimulating them , providing social Outlets , maybe education , training it might be aimed at people learn disabilities or people who are older . Hospice Care is part of that tertiary . It might be end of life care where people"
No," mental health concern in the workplace , they will provide an assessment about your suitability to return to work and they will then provide you access to nurses to counselors so physiotherapists . So it comes back to those Primary Care needs"
No," so there 's our first part B1 of section b , as I said mostly about the places where you can go to get treatment , do n't often see many questions asked about specifics of nursing or um nursing homes . You know those kind of questions or what is primary and secondary , but be"
No," aware of these places the type of treatment they provide because , like the Professionals in A1 A2 , you will be asked where people can be sent for treatment , as well as who can provide that Treatment as always , I hope this helps thanks for"
No, yourself with your respiratory condition . Medical social workers look at how illness affects people and their families from a psychosocial perspective and explores your strengths and stressors and how you can utilize available resources and supports to help
No," assessment with you exploring what is happening to you , how you and your family are coping and working out if there are any changes that can be made to help you cope better with the impact of your illness , what we can offer Will depend on you and"
Environment," level ? What are your strengths , your stressors , and what supports do you currently have available to you ? Are there any changes or adjustments that need to be made in your life or environment ?"
No," , and the reality of living and adapting to a new health issue can be daunting . How everyone copes is different , we 're all coming from different places , and we all have different strengths and weaknesses . Lots of different factors can influence"
No," you or may not , and they may in the future . There is no right or wrong way to feel about your respiratory illness . You may have a huge range of feelings when you are diagnosed and at any stage during your health journey"
No," grief , frustration , anger , relief , guilt , joy , fear , blame the list of feelings , is endless and is unique to every individual and may change or fluctuate during the course of Your medical journey , do n't forget . Your family could also be"
No," useful to discuss these emotions if you can , with your family or friends or with a trusted healthcare . Professional . Remember it 's very normal for everyone to have a mix of good and bad days . This can be a huge and ongoing"
No," psychological adjustment for you and your family over the course of your illness , understanding , illness , the biopsychosocial model of disease , one way of understanding how illness affects us is the biopsychosocial model"
No," Let 'S have a look at an example on the next slide : the vicious cycle of breathlessness example . To give an example of how biological , psychological and social factors interact , let 's have a look at the vicious circle"
Environment," of breathlessness in respiratory illness , as you can see and may have experienced , breathlessness exacerbations and fear of breathlessness can result in limited mobility and lack of exercise . This can then be compounded by social isolation or withdrawing from your"
No," normal social activities and support networks . This can , in turn , lead to low mood , depression or anxiety , which can then exacerbate your perceptions of breathlessness . So , as we can see from this example"
No," mental health , not just illness , as we can see from the graphics and , as we know from our own experience , many different parts of our lives impact other areas for better or worse by understanding a problem . We can understand how to cope better"
No," You are an active participant in your life and in managing your health . If you need advice , information or support , it 's important to recognize this and ask for help . This may be from a family member or friend , or from a healthcare . Professional"
No," support agencies may have local groups or information days available . It is important for your mental and physical health to remain socially active . This could be in person or online , while this may be challenging . For many reasons"
No," , it 's important to find some way to connect with others . Continuing hobbies or learning new skills are always to enhance mood and emotional wellbeing and give a sense of purpose and achievement . There are many free courses"
Environment," and activities available , and your local library may also be able to help you research this if you are n't online . Looking after your physical health is crucial , try to stay active and seek the advice of your health care provider about physical exercise and what would"
No," be useful for you being honest about your emotions and how you are coping can be difficult . However , it may be useful to talk with family friends or health care professionals . If you are struggling , remember you are someone suffering with an illness , it is"
No," not your complete identity and there are so many more parts to you , your life and your hopes and dreams . It is valuable to focus on and be grateful for the good things in your life too . The people , family or friends around the person with the"
No," psychological health , ask for help advice , support from your family , friends or health care professionals . If you need it join a support group . There are carer support groups that support carers to look after themselves"
No," if you are struggling with your mood , mental health or are worried about alcohol or drug misuse , you may be able to access counselling or mental health services via referral from your gp . Some services are available in the"
No," community via primary care . Some services are available free on medical cards , or else there are a range of private services available . Please ensure any services you attend are regulated by a professional body . Sadly , as respiratory conditions progress"
No," , some of you may need palliative care input . It might be useful to speak with your gp or respiratory team about referral to these services . Community palliative care teams can help with symptom management and"
No," card and forms can be found on the hse website . If you need oxygen therapy , you can get oxygen on the medical card or it can be recouped via the drug 's payment scheme via your local hse office . If you 're , looking for information on"
No," enjoying life is important as well as looking after your health talk to your family , friends and health care professionals , it 's okay , not to know or to need help . Just ask you"
No," I 'M a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist , so i put children to sleep for a living and i 'm an academic . So i put audiences to sleep for free um , but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at"
No," the packard children 's hospital up at stanford . In palo alto - and it 's from the experience of about 20 or 25 years of doing that , that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease . Now , most of the time , you think of pain"
No," is a symptom of a disease and that 's true , most of the time it 's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation , but about 10 of the time after the patient has recovered from One of those events - pain persists . It"
No," a very different feeling now . What does it have to do with chronic pain ? Imagine if you will these two ideas together . Imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather , but your brain was telling you that this"
No," is what you were feeling , and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain . In fact , imagine something even worse . Imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather and their brain were telling them that they were feeling"
No," purplish in color . It was categorically cold to the touch . The muscles were frozen , paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that . The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to"
No," her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder , but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day . The worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch , the"
No," lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve of a garment , as she put it On caused excruciating burning pain , how can the nervous system get this so wrong ? How can the nervous system"
No," modulation amplification and in the case of pain , the distortion of sensory experiences . These glial cells become activated . Their dna starts to synthesize new proteins , which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves , and they"
No," happens with chronic pain and that 's why pain becomes its own disease . The nervous system has plasticity , it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli . Well , what do we do about that ? What can we do in a case like chandler 's ?"
No," We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion . At this point in time , we treat them with symptom modifying drugs , painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain . We take nerves that are noisy and active , that should be quiet"
No," and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and , most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous System to respond normally"
No," to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life , and we support all of that with a intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies"
No," severe chronic pain . It 'S successful , as you can see , from this video of chandler , who , two months after we first met , her is now doing a backflip , and i had lunch with her yesterday , because she 's , a college student studying dance at long"
No," beach here and she 's doing absolutely fantastic , but the Future is actually even brighter . The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs"
No," that simply mask the problem as we have now , but that will be disease modifying drugs . That will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate"
No," that spill over and cause this central nervous system , wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience . That we call pain so that i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin"
No," will be realized . Who said my philosophy ? No pain , no pain . Thank you very much."
No," The research you have done around chronic pain , I think , is game . Changing . I think it 's helping so many practitioners , it 's helping so many patients all over the world find Healing where previously there was"
No," stress and heartache . So right at the top . You know what is chronic pain . What do those two words mean yeah , and how common is that yeah , well , everyone 's experienced pain and we need pain"
No," is , is a protector pain is something that it turns out . Our brain creates and generates . So what I say to all of my patients pain is a discomfortable experience basically , but it 's also an emotion , and so , when you get down to it"
No," , we kind of think as every time someone has pain that there must be something wrong with their body and it Turns out as we 'll discuss , the vast majority of people who have chronic pain , actually do n't have a structural problem in their body ."
No," Most people with acute pain probably do because if you break an ankle or something , and if you break an ankle , you want pain because it tells you it 's a message that your brain is giving you just to stop . Don'T walk on a broken ankle , but it"
No," turns out if you have a broken heart , you might get chest pain , but it might be due to your brain , giving you the message that there 's something amiss , there 's something wrong in your life and so what I say to All my patients is , you ca n't understand , pain unless you understand"
No," how the brain works . So we start with that , because it 's a much broader view of understanding pain that you know that we can get into yeah when you say acute pain versus chronic pain . What does that mean and do you have some examples of common conditions or"
No," syndromes or or diagnoses that fit under this chronic pain , diagnosis , yeah for sure , take headaches in the U.S , 25 million people suffer with chronic headaches , and so , if you have headaches , you think"
No," there Must be something wrong ? There is something wrong . You have pain , but it 's chronic . It 'S not like you , you know you hit your head and you have a you , have an injury to your forehead and it hurts and it 's going to go away in a couple days or you have a tumor or an"
No," , they get tested for their sinuses , their teeth , their ears , their their mouth , Etc . And there 's nothing wrong . So , what 's the cause , it 's chronic headache pain . What we call primary headache right . So , what 's the cause of that most doctors say : well , it 's genetic or I do n't know or"
No," whatever , and what we 're saying is we know exactly why people get have chronic headaches because we can talk to them . We can listen to them . We can hear their story and we understand how the brain works and how the brain can create a cycle of pain due to neural circuits"
No," that get activated due to stress and emotions and life situations . And then it continues to get activated by this vicious cycle of pain , leading to fear of pain , which leads to more pain . You know , I I reflect back on my career to date and I remember early on"
No," as a primary care doctor . Some of the most frustrating cases were those patients who would come in with chronic pain , whether it be chronic , migraines headaches , bilateral arm pain . You know whatever it might have been because as a medical doctor , certainly"
No, I can remember this lady coming in maybe 60 62 . You know she would smoke 15 or 20 cigarettes a day . She was really struggling with life . She was on a whole host of painkillers . You know I had all these letters from the from the pain
No," clinic the you know . You know just increased the pregabalin by 25 milligrams , or I remember seeing her thinking everything we 're doing . Nothing 'S working and all I 've got was a specialist letter telling me to increase the dose of a"
No," pain medication by 25 milligrams , even though nothing 's working anyway , I I wish I could go back to that patient now , knowing what I know uh through your research through my Own clinical experience I wish I could go back and"
No," , we 're talking about BandAid care , put something over it as opposed to look and and find the underlying cause and the pain that is experienced in chronic headache and migraine and irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia and chronic pelvic Pain and we 've done"
No," research in looking at the cause of these and the most people with neck and back pain . We'Ll talk more about that in a minute . The pain they experience is real . It 'S not imaginary , it 's not in their head , it 's be , but it is in their brain because"
No," , that the pain is real and that they can get better . What a hopeful message , as opposed to the incurable message that are mainly given by so many doctors and groups that are working in that space . This idea that"
No," when we experience pain most of the time , there 's nothing actually structurally going on in our body . I think it 's quite profound for people , because I think I think we grow up with the understanding that"
No," if we have pain , there 's a physical cause of that pain - and you mentioned earlier on that the brain creates this experience of pain . You mentioned something that I think most people many people have experienced when they have a broken"
No," heart . They can literally feel a pain in their hearts right , but nothing physical has actually happened so help us understand that what 's going on , how does the brain generate this experience of pain , and why does it do it as well ? Yeah yeah ! It is"
No," see the other day . I was driving by my friend 's house . I had n't seen him in a while . He was on vacation . I drove by he 's standing in his doorway . It 'S like oh wow , he 's home awesome . I drive up to the drive , knock on the door . There 'S no one home"
No," , my brain created the image of him standing there , basically a hallucination and police officers . This is controversial . My wife does n't like me to talk about it , but they go to the scenes of crazy stuff , especially in the states and uh . They have to say : do I see a gun"
No," , but I did n't know her name , but our brain . My brain was just latching on to something and creating something , and so when you break an ankle , it 's not your ankle , causing pain , an ankle ca n't cause pain . When you touch a hot stove , it 's not your finger ."
No," The impulses go to the brain , but the brain decides , and this is the craziest thing it 's true neuroscientifically . The brain decides whether to actually turn on pain or not whether to give you the experience of pain or not . How do we know that ? Because a lot of people and a lot"
No," of people have experienced themselves , you get an injury and you have no pain at all , so the brain decides whether to turn on pain or not , and it 's there to protect you , it 's something that everyone needs . It 'S like a smoke alarm"
No," sure , but whether God created us that way or we evolved that way , but that 's how our brain works , so the pain that occurs due to a a fracture is exactly the same as the pain that occurs due to a stressful situation that occurs In our life , it 's real pain and it 's can be"
No," severe pain and that 's what people say : how can the pain be so freaking severe yeah and not be due to a structural injury ? It 'S it 's amazing , but it 's true . We see it every day , yeah and that 's . I think the powerful a lot of your work , a lot of"
No," your research , is helping to give scientific validity to something that many practitioners have experienced . Many patients have experienced that emotional pain , emotional injury can totally manifest as physical pain"
No," I have found , like you , Howard . I think that many cases , arguably the majority of cases with chronic pain , can be healed . In my experience , at least I 'd love your view on that , without using any medication . If you take time to help the patient"
No," anybody says it 's all in your head - it 's cruel yeah and it 's ignorant because it implies that it 's their fault , that they want the pain , somehow that they 're , crazy or mentally Deficient , you know are making it up , and none of that is true at all , and so that"
No," and had to , I do n't know , take crutches to work with them . People would be sympathetic , they could see that they could understand . Yeah . Oh man , you need some help . You know I get it you 're in pain right . We have an understanding of that"
No," , but a lot of emotional pain is hidden . We ca n't see it the people around . You ca n't see it so , therefore , one of them we have sympathy for as a society , the other one we kind of ignore right and we 're not really looking at the whole person . So if you take for an example , it 's kind of a"
No," like that and then she gets migraine headaches . Do you have sympathy for her ? Of course , you do and then she 's in her 20s and she marries a guy who happens to be kind of like her father kind of maybe abusive or maybe harsh , with the children , and then she starts getting irritable"
No," , bowel syndrome or pelvic pain . Do we have sympathy for her and then when she 's 35 she divorces the jerk , but still not paying child support or whatever , and then she gets in a small car accident and then her neck starts to hurt and it"
No," gets worse and then her whole back starts To hurt and then she starts to feel anxious or depressed and then maybe she gets pain all over and they say she 's got fibromyalgia and now , at the end of this she feels completely broken and people maybe are looking at her , like"
No," to be heard , listened to respected , cared for , and when you look at it that way , yeah this pain is real and all these pains are due to the stress , that 's been caused In her life that none of which is her fault"
No," , when you use the term chronic pain , are you able to list some of those conditions that fall under that umbrella term and I 've got a reason for asking this ? You mentioned headaches already , but if you could just sort of go down a common list , because I think this"
No," conversation and what we 're talking about is relevant to almost everyone , whether in their own lives or someone very close to them . And I wonder if you might just make it super super clear for us who we 're referring to yeah exactly well chronic pain , just means any pain"
No," , that 's lasted for you know they say three months or six months as the definition , but the conditions that are commonly what I would call Neural circuit based pain , in other words , brain generated pain in"
No," the absence of structural problem , our primary headaches like tension and migraine headaches and other headache conditions like occipital , neuralgia , trigeminal neuralgia . Most people with TMJ problems do not . Actually , you can find that there 's problems in the on the"
No," Xray , but actually , when you talk to them and take their history and take time , and we can - we can talk about how we do that , how we assess people to know for sure TMJ pain . Most of the time is neural circuit base or mind body type pain , um . If you take people with"
No," costochondritis chronic chest pain again in the absence of heart disease or lung disease , most people with the vast vast majority of people with irritable bowel syndrome and what 's called um nonulcerative dyspepsias . The word I 'm looking for uh ."
No," If you take people with chronic pelvic pain , they may be diagnosed as having pudendal neuralgia or pelvic floor dysfunction or vulvodynia , but all those things are just names they 're just describing that you have chronic pain , fibromyalgia , fibromyalgia"
No," , absolutely and most we did a study of chronic neck And back pain and we have n't published it yet uh , but a colleague I have in the states examined 220 consecutive patients coming into his Clinic with chronic neck and back pain"
No," , he 's the physiatrist Physical Medicine physician and he determined that 88 of them had nonstructural pain . I mean that is shocking , because if you go to a doctor with chronic neck or back pain or a chiropractor or"
No," and your listeners yeah . The vast majority of people have those things on xray , as I do in my neck , uh , without pain . At all - and so we have to be very clear and very careful what we 're talking about , and everyone needs a very careful evaluation"
No," , but those are the main conditions , but the brain can produce anxiety and depression when we 're under stress . Obviously , the brain can produce fatigue that can be severe and overwhelming . We see that all the time the brain can produce Eating Disorders"
No," they 're just human , they have a brain , they have a body , they react to stress that occurs in life and everybody has some of these everyone . Does you know when I I like to say when I started my internship ? I was a young doctor . I got diarrhea for six months . What was that"
No," diarrhea real ? Well , it 's real ! You can see it , but it was n't because I had something wrong in my bow . If I can say this on here , I was scared , shitless , you know of being a young doctor and making mistakes and hurting people , and I was just being"
No," was at med school , but I do n't see much evidence of that changing at the moment . You know when I 've spoken to a mutual friend of ask Gabor mate in the past . We and couple talks a lot about trauma and how cillin many medical schools the trauma word does n't even come up at all"
Environment," in the entirety of medical education and now that we know how much early life trauma affects our risk of autoimmune disease and all kinds of Other conditions later on in life , it 's it 's baffling as to why it 's taking this long"
Environment," for it to get into medical school training , because doctors are getting frustrated . Patients are feeling underserved , but that thing you just mentioned Howard about MRI scans . I think that 's a really great point to dive into . I wonder if you could share some of"
No," those statistics if you happen to hand uh , if you take 30 year olds , people in their 30s and you do an MRI . These are people with no pain at all . 40 percent of them have degenerative disc disease 30 have a bulging disc . These are 30 year olds . These are normal findings that"
No," occur with aging . So what happens when you 're 50 50 year olds , 80 percent of people have degenerative disc disease with no pain . 60 percent have bulging discs with no pain . 30 percent have herniated discs with no pain . So here 's the problem that I 've seen as a medical"
No," , bulging disc , at L4 , L5 right , no nerve , impingement or something that 'll be some kind of reports and then you 'll say or as a professional will often say . Oh , the reason you have your pain is because of that disc problem on your scan"
No, more later about how we assess to make sure that we know that the bulging disc is n't the cause of pain but uh . It 'S giving them an erroneous diagnosis . So it 's making them think that there 's a problem that ca n't be fixed or needs
Environment," , not treating the patient and there 's never been a randomized controlled trial , so in showing that surgery for neck or back pain , axial pain is better than watching it or exercise or physical therapy or anything . There 'S no evidence that this is what we should be doing , but"
No," the diet , every time , if you have back pain , the more fearful you are of it , it 's going to get worse over time , because the neural circuits in the brain you 're getting A positive feedback loop , whereas pain , leading to fear , focus on it , worry about it , frustration with it . It"
No," about these mri 's Because because these these abnormalities go up to 90 percent when you 're 60 and Beyond , but but these are people without any pain , it 's like saying , you 've got wrinkles on your skin and that 's the cause of your con . That 'S the cause of your headaches because you"
No," make the problem worse because , as you say , this can worsen things . This can create a fear , and it also what we say is Healthcare professionals . Certainly , as doctors has real power , it can really positively"
No," or negatively influence what that patient believes what they feel like . Let 'S say , they 're . One of these many people who have abnormal MRI scans are their spine . They'Ve got a bulging desk . Let 'S say they probably had that . For years well"
No," before they actually had the pain , maybe that bulging disc has nothing to do with their pain at all and then here 's the problem the way . The way I see it is that if we say that to the patient , oh yeah , oh you know we 've . We found the cause of your pain"
No," that patient then goes out into the world with the belief my spine , my disc , is causing my pain so everything they do after that is based on an erroneous belief system , whether they 're , trying treatments or therapy or anything . It 'S all based on that truth"
No," and that truth actually may not be true . Now . What if I might share with you my own Journey with through and now Beyond chronic pain , because I think perhaps , if you hear that you might be able to explain various bits along the way , would that be yeah . That would be"
No," , uh , probably with appalling lifting technique , because I knew nothing about it at the time . I never had a problem with my back or anything . So I was n't thinking and at one point during the afternoon I remember getting something out out of"
No," the back . I had a sharp pain in my lower right back , drops everything and I just went onto the floor . That 'S the first time to my uh recollection now at least that I experienced back pain now that led to"
No," maybe a 10year history , where the quality of my life was hugely affected . I sorted up against the doctor . You know the university doctor . I went to what happened immediately , so you fell down . You had this acute pain , right , yeah and then did you keep ?"
Environment," paid privately for loads of physio sessions . Limited use again , I 'm not here to have a go at physiotherapy . I 'M just saying for me : it was you know I was doing some strengthening exercises , but was the pain coming and going ? Was it turning on ? Was"
No, probably I do n't know something like 1999 2000 . Something like that . I moved back to the northwest of England from from Edinburgh in 2003 to help look after my dads and I was having real problems like I was . I
No," and your age do an MRI scan on them . A lot of them would have the same scanner shoe , and most of them would have no pain at all . So to be fair to him back then he was basically saying this is a static scan . This simply can not tell me if you have the pain , so I 've got"
No," speak English . It can only speak in some kind of message , so it might have sent a pain so in either case . The point is , is you had pain in your lower back at that moment and then you did the appropriate thing you rested and then you did n't stress"
No," would be fine unless the neural circuit , for that pain continued and what causes a neural circuit for pain , to become chronic or to continue it 's that memory of it . It 'S the fear of it . Next time you go to lift something : there 's a little subconscious reaction"
No," going on in your in your brain . There uh , oh , be careful , do n't lift uh , you might get pain again and then that actually can cause that neural circuit to turn on pain , yeah and so and then it can enlarge , not just the lifting but to other stressful situations like being on"
No, healed yeah and then what happened is the pain became chronic because those neural circuits got activated and then reinforced over time . It 'S so interesting . Looking back at that now with fresh eyes with some Allah in front
No," You know you 're six foot , seven you 're really tall . Of course , you 're gon na have back pain , but I actually there was . There was a deep part Within Me Howard . He thought that 's just nonsense right . I do not have to be committed to a life of backache"
No," this kind of stuff was real and for me it was like . Oh it 's because you 're tall , you look at your posture , you look at all these things and again , I 'm not saying they have no value ever , but I found this guy uh . It was a ski video . Actually , this chap called Gary"
No," Ward , who I 've written about he 's , he 's an incredible incredible guy in terms of biomechanics and I went to see him . I went to study with him and he was basically saying to me that my wife thought the time was flat"
Environment," and he said wrong and I do n't feel you 're , and this is not exactly what he said word for word , but essentially that your right foot is stuck In pronation it 's not uh , you know , I think we can help that right . Foot get better . He gave me some uh five minute exercise to get my"
No," , because when I got the Deep realization so just a quick overview when I was in second or third year at Medical School , My dad became seriously ill with lupus his kidneys failed . He was 15 years on kidney dialysis . That 'S why I"
No," moved back in 2003 , so the Northwest ! That 'S why I live where I lived today , because I was helping my mum and my brother look after Dad for many years now at my dad 's funeral in"
No," I mean this moment like my dad was cremated and I can still remember wearing my suits at the end of the um , the service ."
No," I went my dad 's coffin , I could see it being bought out and it went into the I do n't know the official term like the oven , yeah yeah . You know I saw the the door open . I saw the orange yeah and I am not kidding you right . I can , I can almost feel it now , as I as I"
No," say it to you , as my dad 's coffin went into the oven . I could feel my back is off wow and I was I was like I. I know that just happened , I was n't thinking about it . It was n't like I was planning for this to"
No," , in that moment , where you knew that Dad was literally going to be gone , but because his body 's about to be burnt , there is no more dads yeah on some deep level it was like . I knew I no longer need to care and take on that weight . Well , you had fulfilled your obligation ."
No," You came here to do what you needed to do and it was a great gift to your father and your family , and it was a great gift to you as a son , and it was a beautiful thing , but it was a hard thing and"
No," pointing us towards something that we need to do or we need to take care of . If we are in a situation in your life , which is difficult and overwhelming , you need to change your job or change a spouse or change your relationship or set some boundaries or do something in your life ."
No," You may be having headaches or stomach pain or chest pain or back pain , and you have no idea why . But if you look deeply and you are open to understanding these simple Concepts , you can see it and it 's very real"
No, you 're touching on a concept that often comes up on this show - and I say this with compassion with - I hope - a great deal of sensitivity . But many people have shared with me when the mics are running
No," got through to the other side , so I understand this , you know if you 've had cancer and you 've had real problems with it and you know , or someone 's had a had a friend or a family member who 's died from cancer um . I understand that I 'm not trying to"
No," in any way invalidate that , of course , but what you 're really speaking to for me is this idea that our pain , our chronic pain , it 's a signal and if we can"
No," get to the root cause of what that signal , is the Learnings we 're going to get from that will not only help our pain , but it will help every other aspect of our life as well . The pain is not the problem , it 's the"
No, stop and evaluate whatever the message is and oftentimes . I remember there was a woman I was on . I was on a video call with a bunch of people . A young woman was having neck pain and it had started when she was in her
No," through , what was happening in her life at the time that the neck pain started , and she just started to cry . You know , because she felt compassion for herself . A lot of people have trouble with that right . She felt compassion for herself at that age and what she was"
No, going through and how much pressure she was putting on herself and how hard she was working and other things that were going on in her life and all of a sudden . It made sense to her why she got the neck pain at that time and what happened as she started to cry
No," , as she had her hand over her heart as she was turning those tears into into compassion for herself . Neck pain disappeared . Just like that . It 'S amazing : you mentioned that"
No," it 's important to properly evaluate a patient who 's suffering with chronic pain , because , of course , there might be a structural component that is amenable to some sort of treatment . Yes , of course - and you know related to that - you mentioned"
No, the brain - is what creates the pain ? Do we need to sort of outline ? What happens right ? What happens when we touch a hot stove ? Is it worth us kind of unpicking that to help people understand that yeah for sure the signals that go to the brain go up
No," through the peripheral nervous system through the spinal cord into the brain into several centers of the brain and the different centers of the Brain have different functions so metal , sensory , centers and emotional centers and thought centers and memory centers . All"
No," those things are activated when you get these kinds of nerve signals coming up to the brain and there 's an immediate , and this is all subconscious you 're , not you 're , not thinking like oh , I hid myself . Oh should I get pain or not . You ca n't think that"
No," it 's not a conscious process , it 's all happening on a subconscious level , and so most of the time when you have an injury , the brain will immediately turn on that pain . As a signal just stop stop doing what you 're doing get help swear . You know do whatever you have to do to take"
No," care of yourself um . So that 's what happens in an acute injury , but sometimes those signals are overwritten in an acute injury . The brain may not activate pain because there 's something else going on . You know I like"
No," to say , if you 're running across the field and you break an ankle you 're likely to get pain if you 're running across the field and break an ankle but you 're being chased by a lion . You probably would n't get pain in that situation , so the so there 's a decision"
No," mode . That 'S going on in the brain that can override that . The point is , is that injuries that occur , that cause pain , which is almost all the time those injuries heal , because our body always heals"
No," , but what happens is is that sometimes the danger signal of what 's going on in people 's lives is also activated through memory through prior Injuries through stress that 's going on in our life that can activate this dangerous signal to make the pain continue , even though the"
No," injury heals . So we see this all the time . That 'S why I was asking you like what happened in the aftermath of of you know : hurting your back . Initially , did the pain go away for a while , and then it started coming back well if the pain went away for a while"
No," activated , sometimes all the time or coming and going Or in whatever pattern occurs , but those neural circuits are real and they 're causing real pain . But it 's not because of the injury . So that 's the critical thing that we and"
No," Physicians and PTs and everyone need to understand , to look carefully to really listen to people of what happened with the injury . What happened with the healing and what is the history of the pain ? Because if the pain is turning on and off structurally , if you break your"
No," arm it does the pain , does n't turn on and off yeah . If you go away on vacation , it goes away and you come back to work . It comes back again . That 'S that 's ! A neural circuit problem , if the pain is triggered by stress if the pain is triggered by the wind or"
No," last thing we want to do is Miss a tumor . Miss an infection . Mis miss an inflammatory condition , miss something we desperately want to avoid doing that yeah . I I , as you say that I I think about aerosol bowel syndrome ."
No," Ibs super super common and for years it was that diagnosis of exclusion - oh well , you 've got these problems , these stomach cramps this constipation , this diarrhea , you know bloating whatever it might be"
No," running across a field - and you hurt your ankle , whether your brain decides to give you a pain signal . It 'S gon na depend on the context , but I think that 's really powerful , like if the context says the line is chasing you , your brain , which is always trying to"
No," predict the future based on the past , is going to be like hey . We have no time for pain . I need you to keep running now , whereas , if you can stop , it might go , Hey , listen ! You know , let 's give him pain so that he stops like . Is that an"
No," oversimplification ? No ! No ! That 'S exactly . Is that what happens ? That 'S exactly what happens . Yeah ! Compare that to endurance , running right or endurance events , because I think many people may be familiar with this experience of I do n't know people always say like"
No," David Goggins , this uh former , I think U.S Navy Seal in America , who 's known for doing all kinds of ultra endurance . Events , I think he has something to the effects of when you think you ca n't go on you 're , not even 40 of the way there in"
Environment," terms of you , you 've got so much capacity left that you do n't even know now . I do n't know if that 's based on science or just says viewpoints , but I think that kind of fits in here . Yeah Tim Knox is a exercise physiologist from South Africa and he 's written about this and he calls"
No," I 've spoken about my mum several times : mum 's , quite elderly , now , she 's she 's , very immobile . She needs a lot of care and sometimes she 'll slip off the bed or have a fall , and maybe the carer or often it 's me or my brother will go around and try and help"
No," mum and get her back on . So the bed will get onto a chair . Now , what 's really interesting is even though my back has been healed for years . Usually before I 'd lift mum up , I would be thinking , oh man . I hope this does n't strain . My back"
No," , oh man , I 've got something important this weekend . I hope I do n't pull my back . You know , there 's there 's this kind of almost selffulfilling narrative before I do it , and invariably the next day I 'd feel a bit of tightness and then it would go , and sometimes it would last a few days"
No," and I 'd be thinking . Oh man , it 's because I lifted mum , which kind of makes sense based upon the narratives that we pick up but a few weeks ago . This is exactly what happened . I was in my kitchen . I got a call from my brother . It was about 5 P.M"
No," and he says : hey mate . Are you ? Are you around like Mom slips off the bed ? Um I need some help . I said is mum . Okay , is this an emergency because then mum 's , okay , but we need to get her up a few deep breaths and I thought hey wrong . You 'D go around , do n't show any"
No," stress be totally calm . This is not a bad thing . I 'M lucky that I live nearby . I can go and help my elderly mother . Now , like I reframed the narrative in my head , this is my selftalk , so I went in , I said : hey Mom , how you doing oh you 're sitting there in the"
No, side of your bed . He slips off and she had a little smile . She had a little giggle like in the past . I'Ve gone around feeling quite anxious and quite stressed I was I intentionally went in and I thought before I left it mum .
No," I just said : hey , I 'm a strong human honestly , that 's why I said I 'm a strong wild resilient human lifting . My mum is no problem and I went in with a big smile on my face . Got mum up got her back into bed again . This is an N equals one Howard"
No," right , I 'm aware of that , but I 'm sharing this because it really speaks to your experience . This was just a few weeks ago . I consider myself to no longer have back issues but again there 's a memory . Oh , if I do this in an awkward position , it 's going to cause backhate , but when I went"
No," in with complete stressfree smiling on my face telling myself I can handle this no problem , I felt nothing um so that I think I think that speaks to what you Just said so , you just described what we would call pain"
No," innocuous things . It'Ll be inconsistent , a whole variety of criteria that we use and that we 're using that back pain , study that I described earlier and then we 'll look for any emotional stuff that might be going on or has going on in"
No," their life that may have contributed to it . So we do all that and then we decide . Oh , this is a neural circuit problem . This is amenable to reversing by two types of solutions and the one solution that we 're calling pain , reprocessing therapy and the other type of solution"
No," that we 're calling emotional awareness and expression therapy . So the first one dealing with the neural circuits in the brain directly and the second one dealing with emotions and in our Boulder back pain , study uh we evaluated well , they were a randomized controlled"
No," the history , as I described , this was a neural circuit problem 43 out of the 45 , the other two I 'm not 100 sure about again being cautious , and so I could , and these people had an average duration Of back pain of 10"
No," years wow now of those people , 44 , were treated of those people . 33 were painfree in one month , so 75 of the people we treated were painfree after 10 years of back pain in one month , simply using what we 're"
No," calling pain reprocessing therapy and you just described it to a t really , because what is pain reprocessing therapy . It 'S changing . The narrative , it 's thinking about yourself differently , it 's thinking about the back differently . It 'S understanding ! Why it 's there and"
No," it 's understanding that it is a neural circuit . It 'S having hope that it 's reversible because it is and then it 's as you go to the lift or bend or move you 're telling yourself , I 'm okay , I 'm safe , I 'm not in danger and you 're"
No," smiling . I mean you , you know you did it and when you smile and when you give your brain reassurances , you 're turning off that danger alarm mechanism , that is the actual cause of the pain and so for these . For these folks , we did n't go into emotional issues . We did n't go into their"
No," past , we did n't deal with their emotions at all . We just changed the narrative change the narrative and how powerful that was to have 75 percent of people painfree in one month I mean it 's amazing . There 'S never been a study with chronic back pain or any chronic pain ."
No," That 'S shown that kind of result yeah , that 's incredible , 75 , better after a 10year history in 30 days , yeah , it 's incredible and - and I hope that that gives people listening and watching this hope that actually , no matter how long you 've been suffering there may well be"
No," I 've . Also , I do n't again . I did that . I did n't know it was uh pain , reprocessing therapy , I did n't know . I was doing that by myself . I was just based on everything . I'Ve learned everything I 've seen with patients , it 's like . No just you do n't need to have the"
Environment, safety and we do this right in the office and I 've got videos of folks in my office where you know they 're having pain with bending over and then I have them imagine bending over and then it hurts and saying . Oh you 're imagining bending
No," I do n't think Elliot talks about pain , describes , pain . In fact , I 'd love your uh comments on this . When he 's running , because I was watching that sub to our marathon race , with my with my two kids , we were watching it on my computer"
No," and at various times he just starts smiling yeah , and I I think I 've heard him say in interviews that , when he 's really Hurting when there 's pain , he smiles , he intentionally chooses to"
No," smile yeah . Now again he 's not someone with to my knowledge , a history of chronic pain , but it 's the same idea . Isn'T it he 's kind of almost trying to yeah battle or buffer the Pain by changing his experience effects yeah if you 're into interested in running the"
No," the book by Chris McDougall called Born to Run , is amazing , amazing book uh and he talks about the research showing that The more the more structure , the shoes you know , the the shoe companies , the more structure they give . The more people have pain"
No," how we function day to day in our lives . Now was there a pushback on this ? It is massive , I mean prepare yourself for letters and , and you know people you know really and you know misunderstanding the idea of the pain being real of the of the symptoms of the suffering being real ."
No," You know and I 've been there and you 've been there . You know when my mom was dying . I had all this horrible upper back and neck pain and it just lasted and lasted and lasted , and when my dad was dying , I had leg pain , shooting down my leg and I still get pains now , sometimes"
No," fatigue or the fibromyalgia or the irritable , bowel or the or the back pain is total you 're going to have to live with it . The rest of your life and what kind of message is that so so horrible , and so we 're talking about a new way of"
No," dealing with these disorders , which are the major cause of disability worldwide by far a major cause of disability worldwide , is chronic neck and back Pain , headaches , anxiety , depression , irritable , bowel fibromyalgia"
No," , etc , etc , etc . I think I heard you in a in an interview once say that the increasing prevalence of chronic pain has mirrored , or certainly followed , the"
No," increase in anxiety and depression in society 100 and there 's a great study on that by Tim Brown from Berkeley and he took in The U.S he took Berkeley uh , California . He took um data Nationwide data on Stress and Anxiety in the country following uh 9 11"
No," 2001 , and you can see it rising up over those next couple years and then he took data in the country on back pain and you start mirroring rising up . In the same exactly the same and then as the stress went down after a couple years , I think"
No," it was the back pain started to go down a little bit before back pain has doubled in the U.S in the last 20 years , backs have n't changed our backs . Haven'T changed uh , but the the rates - and we know anxiety and depression have sword are soaring as well and in this , and in this"
No," tell me about repetitive strain injury because , as you said in you know , butt Pain 's going up that Pain 's coming up and much of the time it 's put down to posture and the fact that we 're looking at computers and phones and exactly what 's your view On that yeah"
No," be sore . Of course , it 's going to be sore everyone 's neck is going to be sore over there , but it 's not going to cause chronic pain unless something else is going on in your life , the fear of it the worry about it . The newspaper articles about posture and sitting up straight"
No," up and up and then finally , the government said what 's going on we 're not paying for that , and all of a sudden it makes me feel , Is that a an unintended consequence of doing this ? I do n't just mean with mental health , I mean with everything yeah"
No," you want to raise awareness of things . You want to raise awareness that emotional pain , emotional things that we have n't processed can cause physical pain , but that there is probably a sweet spot , whereas if we start talking about stuff"
No," Edward shorter , called from paralysis to fatigue , where he examines the history of psychogenic type illnesses over the last couple , two or three hundred years , and he talks about how indifferent societies different Symptoms tend to"
No," arise as a cultural phenomenon right now , anxiety and depression are cultural phenomenon . Young people look at the rates of anxiety and depression in teenagers . Now the rates of back pain . There was a study recently where one third of teenagers reported having back"
No," pain and when I you know , I studied Pediatrics and Internal Medicine . When I studied Pediatrics , no teenagers had back pain . It was unheard of a kid had back pain . You were , it was an emergency situation because there was some major problem , and so I have a friend who 's"
No," from Iraq is a physician and uh . He was he 's here . We were talking a great guy . I was saying you know : what 's what was surprising about you when you came to the U.S about medicine here and he said back pain , and I said why is that he said well"
No," , people did n't have back pain in Iraq or Jordan where I practiced . It was very uncommon people had stress , but their stress was manifest in different ways , because culturally there were different outlets for it . Sorry , since we 're UPS , if you are"
No, likely to develop musculoskeletal pain . Who are workers in a factory are those who are being treated poorly by their management and that 's been shown not how much work and physical activity they 're doing how they feel about their work and how
No," People with one to two had seven one to two of these adverse childhood events like abuse , neglect , alcoholism , the family , Etc , one to two at 75 chance of having successful back surgery if they had three or more , they had 15 chance of"
No," , you may have uh be suffering from something , but it may manifest in a different way in a different physical sense of a bit like your colleague from Iraq was saying about back pain , yeah yeah , there 's been some studies about Um , I think the word is granularity in"
No," are not well equipped , I was I was in Australia last week and giving a lecture and uh there was a GI physician there . It 'S been his whole career , seeing people with irritable , bowel syndromes and doing diets and medications , and things like"
No," talk about chronic pain . You see a lot of pain in your view . What is the most important therapy ? You give your patients with chronic pain , because you know he 's a super specialist . You know people who 've got chronic pain"
No," for these people with pain . What they need is to feel heard and validated , because Often by the time they come to me , no one has ever heard or validated their pain , their symptoms that it was real and he goes . The truth is with chronic pain ."
No," thought that was really powerful . Yeah I mean do n't do something just to do something because you can make it worse . You know there 's just there 's a saying in surgery when you operate on pain , you get pain and"
No," percent of the people coming to you for anxiety or depression also have a chronic pain condition , and the question is : who should be caring for these people with chronic pain ? It should actually be the therapist , the"
No," behavioral health people , because they can take the time and they can develop the skills . Your surgeon friend does n't have the time he has the skills to be honest and and have integrity and not operate on what he should n't and to be caring and empathic and listen . He can do"
No," all that , but he can also learn how to talk this language of the brain , causing pain , how to how to assess and say . Oh , your pain is Shifting and moving . That means it 's not due to this disc here yeah this . This would cause pain going down your leg . You do n't have"
Environment," pain , going down your leg right . He can tell people that which that 's what we do right in the assessment and then maybe he can point them to there 's a bunch of apps . There 'S a bunch of online programs in there and we 're training , Physicians and we 're training , nurses and"
Environment," psychotherapists , and massage therapists and acupuncturists , and we 're training folks how to do this pain , reprocessing work and how to do emotional processing work as well . I mean it 's incredible what you 're doing , and you know , as I 've already said , you you 're doing research"
No," before we do that . There 'S two cases . I'Ve heard you talk about before which I think are beautiful illustrations of how powerful the brain is in generating pain . One was , I think , a chap who had been in the Vietnamese War and 20 years later . Something happened on a street yeah . The"
No," other was a UK construction worker , yeah um - I do n't know if you remember those cases , would you mind sharing them , so I think they beautifully illustrate this yeah . Of course , I always tell the three pain stories . Okay . The first paint story is a friend of mine who was at a"
No," construction site alone , shot and nail nail gun shot a nail in his hand , had no pain . Why did he not have pain ? He has a nail in his hand . Well , I do n't know why his brain decided not to turn on paint at that moment , probably because he was all"
No," alone . His brain had to decide , look be in pain and suffer or drive to the hospital . His brain said drive to the hospital I mean you know . I ca n't speculate why that is , but he had no pain . He had no pain at all yeah . Exactly so not all injuries cause pain . Okay , number : two : it 's a guy ! In"
No," Britain , a construction worker jumps off a scaffolding onto a nail sticking up in the ground . The nail goes completely through his boot . He can see the nail sticking out on the other side of his boot . He starts screaming in pain . He has severe pain , they Rush him to the"
No," hospital they give . Him IV pain medication when he gets there and they take his boot off , and the nail is right between his toes there 's no injury at all wow . Is this pain real ? Yes , because all pain is real . All pain is created by his brain and his brain"
No," predicted and the science of the brain is called predictive processing . His brain predicted that he should have pain based on the nail just made an error , but it created this pain and the pain is real . The never"
No," underestimate the power of the brain to create severe symptoms , severe pain , severe fatigue , severe seizure type activity that we see all the time . That 'S actually due to the brain called paroxysmal nonepileptic attacks . We know that because people are"
No," guys died . It was a lot of Gore and he got helicoptered out and meta back down , so he had pain from the shrapnel wound . What happened to his injury ? They healed . Why ? Because all injuries heal those injury healed now did his brain turn off that danger signal and make his pain go"
No," away . Yes , it was , he was fine , he was painfree , but for what 15 20 years yeah 20 years later he 's walking down the street , he gets startled by the sound of a helicopter in the sky and all of a sudden he gets the same pain in his leg . That he had hit 20 years earlier , that"
No," neural circuit for pain had been learned , had been remembered and then had been activated through a triggering response , and that 's part of our assessment that we do to help people see that gee . Why is ? Why is your pain occurring when you sit in that chair , but not that chair ? Why is"
No, your pain occurring when the wind blows ? Why is your pain occurring when the weather changes ? Why is your pain occurring in cold or why does it go away when you take a shower ? Why does it all these changes that we 're looking for to demonstrate these neural circuits ?
No," the brain , generating the pain . It 'S all the brain . So we need to retrain the brain exactly to eliminate it and help people heal yeah . Now I know so many people will be suffering or they 'll have loved ones who are"
No," suffering with some of their chronic pain , symptoms and conditions you 've mentioned . I would strongly recommend your book unlearn your pain , that 's for patients and that 's the people who are struggling . I think it 's really easy to read it 's ."
Environment," It 'S got the research , it 's got some really great practical exercises and I think you also train Healthcare professionals . How ? Where can people find out about that yeah ? Absolutely um ? We do have a book called hidden from view , which is for professionals . We also"
Environment," , um and then we 've got trainings that we 're doing virtual live and recorded trainings . We just launched a mobile app to train people . It 'S called ovidx.com , that 's the name Ovid ! You know was a Roman poet who wrote when the mind is zilities . The body"
No," with can in some individuals generate pain right . What happens ? Is we respond normally with fear of them their success ? Fear of them worry about them worrying . What 'S going on focus on them , paying attention monitoring all the time , fighting them"
No," that gives the brain the message there 's a problem and it makes it worse . So this vicious feedback cycle of pain and other symptoms , leading to these responses , the six F 's fear being one of the most important leading to more pain . So when"
No," we interrupt that cycle , which you did when you lifted your mom that time when you told yourself , you were okay - and you smiled - you interrupted that cycle . You just interrupted the pain cycle by giving the danger signal in the brain , these calming and safe messages , and"
No," that 's what pain reprocessing is at its core and we 've got a whole bunch of techniques of how to do that , so that people can you know step it . You know do this , do this , do this uh change , your relationship to the symptom"
No, anyway . So but people will read his book and then the pain will go away just from the knowledge - and it 's called the book here - and it 's happened . You know many and there 's a documentary on Dr cerno there 's a couple documentaries to
No," so there 's a couple documentaries out there and there 's a new one coming out soon , hopefully called brain pain , which was a documentary done about the boulder back pain study that I was telling you about Right so there 's some films that people can watch to really kind of get a"
No," firsthand glimpse of of some of this work . But but yes , the question the answer is yes , just knowing that you 're , okay can and and maybe 10 15 of people just turn off that dangerous signal . Where do things like journaling and meditation fits in here yeah ? So"
No," once you 've done the uh understanding part of it , and then you start doing this pain reprocessing part of it of lowering the fear reaction beginning to start moving again and challenging any of these triggers by"
No," smiling at them . It sounds silly , but you know the pain is not the enemy is their message . So if you have a child lying in bed , fearful of a monster in the closet , you 're not going to be mad at the kid hopefully you 're going to open the closet door say"
No," the sense of causing these symptoms when a kid falls off a bike . They look to you to see if they should cry or not and if you freak out they cry . But if you smile and say oops that was fun , then maybe they do n't so this is this pain . Reprocessing part"
No," now meditation can fit into that , because we use mindfulness meditation type practices in this work and mindfulness minute . I'Ve been teaching mindfulness since 1999. and everyone should learn mindfulness , there 's no one who 's studied mindfulness"
No," , who does n't agree with that children . Everyone should learn it , but the fascinating thing rangan is that mine in research studies mindfulness , has not been particularly helpful in reducing chronic pain . Why is that cognitive ? Behavioral therapy is not"
No, particularly helpful . Acceptance and commitment therapy not particularly helpful in actually reducing chronic pain in randomized controlled trials . Why is that ? Because none of them are doing the first step of the assessment of categorizing the pain into
No," a neural circuit problem , as opposed to a structural problem . So when you do mindfulness you 're you 're noticing your Sensations in your body , but it hurts it 's painful . It 'S uncomfortable and you 're interpreting those Sensations as being dangerous"
No," compassion , and the reality is that the symptom , this pain or whatever it is , is basically a thought . It 'S basically created by the brain , and now , if you can observe that now you can step back from it"
No," up . Well , that 's interesting ! What 'S going to happen next , oh it just went down . Oh that 's interesting ! Oh , it moved over here and all of a sudden you see , and then it really , as you said , it drops all of a sudden . You you get it and then so . So meditation has a really"
No," important role in this , but not just meditate yeah , understand and use the tool in a way which is going to help reverse the pain as opposed to cope with it . There 'S studies on yoga , I think as well . Aren'T there that yoga uh"
No," deep breathing practices , whether whether it 's part of yoga or not , can help change our perception of pain ? I think there 's quite a lot of studies on that sure , of course , because what you 're doing is you 're making yourself feel safer , you 're calming the dangerous signal . You"
No," pairing , the the calming And the reassurance and the joy with moving your body so neurons that fire together wire together . So when you , when you 're moving with fear , you 're reinforcing these neural circuits of pain , fear pain . But when you start moving gently with calm"
Environment," or with joy or with control or with peacefulness , now you 're training , your brain , that these movements are not dangerous and those neural circuits start to get ingrained . I'Ve written on this quote that you have written in an article"
No," um over the past decade . I'Ve learned that migraine , along with other related conditions , such as chronic tension , headaches , pelvic and abdominal pain , syndromes , chronic neck and back pain are often caused by a combination of Life ."
No," saying : hey , I 'm safe , it 's okay , um , but then we can get into the emotional side of it because you mentioned journaling . So journaling is part of the techniques that we would use on the second part of the treatment , not the pain"
No," reprocessing part , but the emotional awareness and expression therapy which we 've developed and worked on it , has components of intensive shortterm Dynamic Psychotherapy that my friend and colleague Alan Abbas has the foremost researcher and teacher in the world on"
No," that , plus some internal family systems work as well . So if you put kind of those things together , you start to deal with the emotions of it and that 's a whole nother area that can really lead to healing healing on the inside yeah , not"
No," with chronic pain , and I guess why I 'm thinking of that is if early life trauma if Aces uh are hugely influential in what 's going to happen later on in life , including with chronic pain , I 've had Three"
No," , but often we develop certain traits certain personality traits , so not really who we are they 're , Who we became to get through childhood ? You know so poor selfesteem , so you know being a people . Pleaser wants to do things for other people right ."
No," Those personality traits , as I believe escabel , believes , are not necessarily who people are or how who they have to remain . If they go and do the emotional words about to go , oh actually , that was a defensive mechanism that I took on to help me through"
No," chronic pain , syndromes , yeah , there 's no question about them . There 'S really kind of three ways to think about it . One way is we 're . We'Re are actually born , not blank slaves . There 'S been really nice , studies of children and and temperament , so to speak . Some kids are more sensitive"
No," , which is the acquired personality traits and those are highly uh connected to uh later life , uh pain and other of these type of neural circuit type . Problems for sure - and the reason is , is , like you say , they 're adaptive , you know if you , if your dad"
No," comes home every day and sometimes he 's really nice and kind , and sometimes he 's really angry and and critical . You learn to be on edge . You know you learn to be a people pleaser , if you 're , if your sibling is sick and they 're , getting all the attention in the family , because they 're"
No," , sick they 've got leukemia or they 've got bad asthma or whatever they 've got a mental illness . Well , you learn to get into the background and be a people pleaser and be a perfectionist and be always being good and putting yourself last because everybody else"
No," at all . So I 'm I 'm so delighted that we finally got to cover chronic pain in all its many different forms in all its different guises . Um . I feel that what you have done , certainly to me is"
No," , is help people feel less alone , but actually no , no . Your pain is real . Yes , maybe your doctors have n't found anything structural . Maybe you think you 're going crazy with pain , but you 're , not it 's just that no one 's helped you yet"
No," , where do painkillers fit in here in your view ? Well , when when people are suffering , you know we want to alleviate suffering , I mean that 's part of being a physician part of being a caregiver . So Dr cerno kind of had an idea . He wanted people to throw away their pills"
No," , throw away their crutches . You know throw away their the things that are helping them cope , which is fine when you have that amount of confidence - and you know it 's not too bad , but you know some people need pain medications , certainly if they have ongoing . You know if you"
No," have metastatic cancer kind of situation . Uh . You know . Doctors have gotten worried about giving pain , strong pain , medications of people who are dying of cancer . I mean that 's silly , you know . Why should we not alleviate suffering in that way and , if someone 's suffering with"
No," severe pain due to a neural circuit type problem , they may need pain medications while they do this work , certainly - and so I do n't want to - I do n't want people to feel like they . Can you know never take a pain medication"
No," um , but if you , if you can alleviate pain with pain , medications temporarily , while you start investigating your life , while you start the pain , reprocessing work yeah . Well , you start dealing with some of the emotional situations in your life . Then , over time you can reduce the pain"
No," , the nocebo effect kicking in , so people are fearful that their medications are being taken away from them forcefully and now the pain is going to be worse because the brain is put into a bigger state of Fear and lowering the medication is much harder , so what we try"
No," to do is we try to First just stay on your medication . Let 'S see if we can get you out of pain first , if we can get you out of pain using these methods , then tapering that medication is going to be easy . I guess this speaks to"
No," new information , hopefully Yeah , you can actually set them on a different path , and I think it . This is why I think healthcare professionals need to understand this stuff , because we can be hugely influential in what that patient believes when they walk out of that door ."
No," the easy thing to say it does play a huge role , but I think our understanding is simply not there . As well for this um , I I do n't know about you , Howard , I 've . I'Ve often found with some of these pages in chronic pain , though that"
No," they 're taking huge amounts of medication and they 're still in pain , right right for sure what we 're doing is the BandAid technique . The coping Technique we keep adding on to that more and more and more"
No," information now you can look at what 's happening Over time - and you can look for those experiences that you can have , which show that oh the pain , this happened in my life and the pain went up , or this happened in my life"
No," and the pain went down yeah or it 's inconsistent . Why is it happening sometimes ? And not other times , and now that you have a framework for understanding that you can say hmm , maybe it is my brain after all : wow , would n't that be something yeah ."
No," How this podcast is called , feel better live more when we feel better in ourselves . We get more out of our lives . I clearly pain is something that makes people feel worse . It affects every single aspect of their lives for people who are listening , who are"
No," watching who are struggling in their lives , they 're struggling with pain or someone close to them as suffering with chronic pain . Do you have any final words for them ? Well , I think the the starting point has to be"
No," compassion and caring and understanding . And if we take away , if we can strip away some of the fear and some of the pejorative words and it 's all in your head , if we can strip away the"
No," discs - and you know the names you know the the you know - oh it 's chronic fatigue , it 's and there 's so many Names , I do n't know we have time to get in there there 's so many names have been given to people . Oh you 've got chronic lyme disease . You'Ve got"
No," to look at people 's lives and look at their symptoms and see what you can find yeah , because when you do , that , Usually you 'll see maybe there 's something here that we can work in yeah . Just just on that points . You mentioned chronic fatigue , uh chronic lyme disease"
No," , these kind of things and um . I do n't want anyone to go away from this conversation , uh feeling there at the end that hey um - oh , so I do n't have that or you know I I do have that and having children just said forget about that . I think I think"
No," that um uh people with preexisting anxiety , depression , loneliness fear are more likely to get lung oven and those that do n't have that prior to getting coven . There 'S research showing that people who did n't have covid , who had as high or"
No, it medically and the symptoms are brain fog and fatigue and aches and pains and and diarrhea and headaches and anxiety and depression . It 'S all there what 's the harm in looking at it closely and looking at it from this lens of neural circuitry . What 'S the Herman just
No," to her situation looked at the symptoms that she was having the brain fog , the fatigue , the all the testing that she had making Sure that there was nothing structural wrong and then we started having her change her relationship to her symptoms , knowing that she could get"
No," think , 10 different diagnoses , including anxiety , IBS depression . She had everything all the buckets that we can give you in modern medicine yeah she had been given all of them . She was on 20 pills a day . I'Ve got many other cases like this , but this is one that the"
No," You just picked up all these kind of carriages and you 're walking around your life with them you 're on 20 pills a day , you 're still in pain . You ca n't work , you ca n't be a mother , you ca n't be a wife , the way you want to , let 's just start from scratch : let 's just"
No," see how I can help create Health in you with . You know Emotional Self , sleep stress , movement , whatever it might be yeah and as we did six weeks later , she was painfree painfree and then two years later . So this is , after the show would finish two years later , she 's on"
No," zero pills a day . Yeah amazing - and I say that you will have seen this many times at your clinic , but I I say this to lead people with a message of Hope at the end . It 'S not that we 're saying that 's , not real . It 'S just saying . Maybe we need a kind of different approach : yeah yeah"
No," we found the way , but some people will yeah some people . Will I guarantee then well how you 're a huge part of this change in thinking about pain , that 's going on all across the world . I hope like you , that it speeds up and gets out to more and more people"
No," more and more Healthcare professionals . Thank you . So much for all the work you 're doing and that 's coming on the show . Thank you . It was a pleasure and an honor appreciated . If that conversation about chronic pain , resonated with you , I think you are really going to enjoy this"
No," powerful conversation . All about the common reasons that many of us feel lost and unhappy addiction is the most human thing . There is all addictions do attempt to gain pain , relief , emotional pain relief or something or another . Then this whole society is so expert at selling us"
No," I was raised in the mainstream culture where if you feel bad, you take something to make that feeling go away. Around that time that I first started to work for the VA, I looked at the treatments that we have. I did the first study on Prozac for PTSD, the first study for Zoloft for PTSD,"
No," and a number of other conventional drugs. What we found is they didn't work very well. Our conventional way of thinking about it is not working. I thought, ""Okay, if it doesn't work, let's see what else could work."" My name is Bessel van der Kolk. I am a physician, I'm a psychiatrist."
No," Okay. For me, the opening to a new world came when some people in my clinic started to do something very strange, called EMDR. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. You ask people to call up the memory of what you saw back then,"
No," And so you form a deep relationship with your internal sensory system. Yoga, at the end, was a more effective treatment for PTSD than any of the drugs we had studied. But I've yet to see a psychopharmacology clinic being transformed to a yoga studio."
No," But do you think about his idea? We are thinking about psychedelics. What do you think about psychedelics for trauma?"" And I go like, ""Wow! You're speaking for my heart,"" because of course, I'm a child of the sixties and we dabbled in LSD and psychedelic substances."
No," These drugs are illegal."" And they said, ""Thank you very much for your opinion. We'll try it anyway."" They got permission to do a study of MDMA, also known as ecstasy or molly, for trauma. And it worked out pretty well. Able to collect a large amount of money"
No, with two therapists in your room for eight hours. What we see in the people who get the drug is amazing. People are able to go to places they have never felt safe to go. This is not a picnic. They see the horrible things that's happened to them. But MDMA allows people to see themselves with compassion.
No," All these measures we have about selfperception and selfawareness just shoot up. And rather than blaming themselves, they're able to say, yes, this what happened to me, but it's over. Part of what has kept me so busy all these years is how can we find a treatment that allows the basic sense"
No," the part 1 video , when you order the form in the first place , you get one sent out to you , that 's tailored to you . So it has your name and your National Insurance number and everything coded on to the to the phone which helps them with their system in terms of scanning it and"
No," service , so it 's always worth thinking of contacting them as to whether there 's any availability for that in your area as to whether they can come and fill the form out for you anyway . We'Ll just get straight into , I want to keep this video short as possible ."
No," application form to define as to whether your Relative doable or not , some people can get all of their eligibility in just one question , so it might be that they have such significant problems with managing their medication , for example , or medical treatments that it requires that"
No," period whatever . So that might be the case . If you have significant memory problems and you 're going through the process have been successful dementia . You know something like that : okay , so that will cut there for you section two about your health condition on"
No," going that half condition , breathing problems , vision , problems , hearing problems , liver stomach , digestion , bowels . All of that and basically anything goes in there do n't be too specific . Equally , if you are so , you have parkinson 's , for example , and you 've listed that then you"
No," with all these applications . If you do forget anything , whilst it 's being processed , you can send additional information in to be looked at . So the next question to me is about medication and medical treatments that you might be having , so you would ideally"
No," All of those things you know , we 've met , as I said before , you may think it 's relevant . You may not think it 's relevant . It does n't matter . Just stick it all in also many treatments , you have n't obviously dialysis that would go in there chemotherapy anything like that"
No," , but , as I say , any any treatment , you are having dressings being changed on a regular basis by a psychic , a community nurse or something like that . A district nurse - thank you . Yes , so everything physiotherapy as well , if you 're doing anything like that , that all"
No," needs to go in there speech and language therapy , possibly maybe you 're recovering from the stroke and you 're learning to speak or to swallow food again . So you know things like that or ghosting . So now we get down to the nittygritty , which is the"
No," questions about how your health condition or disability affects you and your daily living activities . So the first question is about preparing food . This is quite they 're all important . All of these questions are important , but preparing food is something that"
No, preparing a meal . So it may be that you 're not able to prepare a meal at all and that you need somebody to do absolutely everything for you . That might be that you have possibly learning disability that prevents you from doing that . It might be that you are unwell
No," need a trolley ? Do you need to have help for somebody with this part , but not that part sort of say it 's going through as much detail as you possibly can like this obviously you 're going to want to get across any pain or discomfort that you might get while doing this , And your"
No," tiredness , you feel any confusion might be memory loss . Most importantly , any risks . Are you gon na cut yourself ? Are you gon na burn ? You are you going to leave something on the pad , because your memory is not very good , you know . Is there a possibility of you"
No," ca n't do the rest of it , so you know really going as much detail as you possibly can with that section and again , if somebody is , is cooking for you or preparing for you delivering a meal to you . Whatever make sure you detail that as well , it 's"
No," way , and that can be quite difficult . It might be that you 're doing that yourself . I do n't one chap who hacked us to pump it in he 'd like a pump and did it himself and have some people need to have assistance with that they have a camera community ."
No," Although you may , it might be that you have vision , problems need to be told if you spill food down yourself or where the food is on the plate , so that you can find it might be that you have perception problems . So , no , you need to be told what food is . What possibly memory"
No," It could be chewing swallowing digestion . Maybe you have problems with choking . You might need your food cutting up or mashing up . You may need to eat certain types of food and possibly new support with seeing what is in each type of food . You know , particularly if you 're , diabetic"
No," Maybe , as I say it might be difficulties with memory all those kind of things . It 'S the more detail . The acquaintance that the better of , as always with these things , some people will find that they have to eat it strange times today and that that needs to go in there as well ."
No," what happens ? Do you get tired as a result of that life , because you 're not eating ? Are you more prone to infections and illness and so on ? Does it make it clear if you 're not getting enough nutrition and the effect of that in there question 5 managing treatments ? Now"
No," I 'm romping through this , because the PIP form is very very long and I 'm aware this video can run very , very long managing treatments again this . This is as much about the planning of treatments as much as the actual administration of the treatments . So obviously , if somebody"
No," has problems , memory or confusion , you know they have any disability or difficulty . Then it may well be that their medication is administered by a carer , a professional care or possibly a family members . Something like that , and so that information we need to go in"
No," You make sure you take the appropriate boxes for this . It 'S again about aids or appliances , so , as in the case with depression , might have the thing on your finger diabetes , little blood test . If you 're have breathing difficulties , you might"
No," have oxygen tanks , you might have all of those kind of things quote quite a lot and then obviously have question about . Do you have , and you want to help you with that and again with this you 're , always thinking about ddoes . Doing these things of dealing"
No," with these things , does it call me any cause me any illness or tiredness stress fatigue worry anxiety . Any of that you know how am I , after I 've done what I I 've done . You know some people that develop insulin , dependent diabetes in their later years might have an issue"
No," with injecting themselves with the needle , and that might cause them quite a lot of anxiety . You never know what it 's it is or how important this can be . So if you gave it , even if you think it 's not that important , properly question six washing and bathing , do you use any kind"
Environment," shower , how you get out of the shower , how you get in and out of the bath , if you 're , unable to show or bath because of physical difficulty to get in maybe your particular living environment is n't suitable For you to do that , you do n't have a walkin shower . You'Ve just got a"
No," something like that , like the steam causes a problem for your breathing when you 're in there might be that you get particularly tired when you 're washing bathing . You know this there 's all manner of things that can go on here , like I say so , make sure it all"
No," goes in and look at how you are afterwards . Do you need to recover ? You know : do you only shower once a week , because it 's really difficult and the rest of the time you just have a so they 've , you know top and tail quick wipe down with a flannel ."
No," his well ? Can you dry yourself off easily ? You know all very important , sayma toileting , so you 're , looking at Steve 's , major appliance , it might be toilet frames , get on and off the toilet might be a bottom white , but they do exist . It might be that you , maybe you 've , got"
No," difficulty using the toilet , but they can use a normal toilet . Some people just can not use a normal toilet , they have to have a disabled toilet again . Memory or cognition or comprehension is also an issue here , so it is not able to tell you themselves in terms of you know"
No," afterwards that they put their clothing , was strength of the Gani detritus on the hands or feet that back in their shirt or anything that needs cleaning off . You know that 's there 's like loads of things that it could be . So if it 's related to your pocket , it do n't do any harm"
No," dementia learning disabilities . Something like that . That kind of communication - you know you can have a chat , they can express themselves quite clearly , but getting into the nittygritty of why there 's been an increase in their power bill from empower and they have used"
No," support with actually accessing services in the normal way that you or I might also memory comes into this a little bit . If you have issues with remembering words or losing the conversation , the thread of the conversation where it 's going all that kind of stuff , you know"
No," apply to anything could be letters that you 've been sent . It could be from an navigates somewhere to the doctor , is going to catching the bus anything like that . We need to really read constantly throughout our lives without really thinking about it . Do you make a note as"
No," well if somebody is read a lot for pleasure books and things , and then they certainly stop doing so that might be with commenting on it might be that as you 're reading you have memory problems , you ca n't remember what it is . You'Re reading"
No," you know , keep up with my friends . You know , but actually there might be , might be things that are happening that you just not aware of so it could be anything . It might be that you suffer anxiety and distress when you 're out with people might be that you have"
No," often , people with learning disabilities and they have carry the vainglory or they live in a shared house . That 'S run by carers and their finances are managed by your care company . Might be that you just have somebody you know helping you with a lot of older people might have"
No," there 's . Somebody has countenance problems . You have to plan for the continents . Where are the toilets ? Where are the rest stops ? Do we have to tech ? Do you have to take equipment with you to prevent any accidents ? Equally , there 's other conditions where you have to take"
No," equipment . You know oxygen if you 've got breathing . Problems might be that you have a heart condition need to always be within 500 meters of a defibrillator not allowed to leave a certain area , because the only place you can have treatment is at a certain hospital . You know so there"
No," This is where we 're looking a lot more in anxiety and stress - worry it 's things like that , because this can be quite crazy for a lot of people with depression and anxiety , he 's just going out and doing simple things , and it may well be that they need support To do"
No," differences , you know approach situation and do there is a question ? Are you a name ? Are you able or unable to go out because it 's very anxiety or distress , I think , simply with that leaflet just dropped through the door ? With that be very , be very honest . You know if it 's"
No," with these things and just take yes , do n't take , sometimes so yeah and again this is as much information as you can put in moving around is the exception . That 'S most important the mobility because they 're looking at your ability to mobilize and they ask you how far you"
No," If you frequently stop , I want to know how or they want to know how far you can get until you stop . I kind of need to rest before I can go any further , so they give the example that 50 meters is the same as 50 . Buses enter and you know which is kind of true . Five buses , not 50"
No," Or are you able to carry anything moving ? Do you are you likely to fall through balance , problems of trips or vision problems ? Do you do you have severe pain ? Do you get out of breath and have to stop to catch your breath ? All of those kind of things again"
No," , this is this section , really the more detail that or the more that you can put in to this section , the better it 's gon na be for you I mean , ideally , if you have got mobility problems , if you 're not getting sort Of eight points or more on this section , then you wo n't be receiving"
No," any of the mobility payment , so you have to really make sure that you get these things across , but barring mines that anything , do you saying this they will sort of check on when they do The visit well , when you do the assessment face to face assessment"
No," information and a later date . If you wish or send further evidence in there . Just make sure you put your name and your national insurance number on the top of any additional sheets of anything , no did n't , even if it 's just a prescription list make sure you do that ."
No," share subscribe head over to part three ? Obviously , this has been quite a long video , as expected with the PIP form . You might have watched all of it if you have what you got to this point where you 've watched any of it . Thank you very much for doing so . I hope this has been a help"
No," websites as well . The RNIB do a very good sort of checklist to go through to help you with that . The outside Society also have similar documentation as well . There 'S help you when filling out these forms , so it 's worth checking out those websites to you so yeah hope this has"
No," of our discussion . Basically , the role of the support worker is to assist the client as per needed , as mentioned in the care plan , as per needed care under the supervision of the nurse aide and under the guidance of the family members as well . So , basically , the role of the"
No," client will understand us and we can understand them as well use of discretion . It is your judgment . You are responsible of judgment . You have to use your judgment , for example , if a client is depending on you for so many activities of daily living , you have to give them"
Environment," Whatever is the regulation or wherever you go across Canada ? Always the center of focus is always the client client safety , clients , care clients right must be always appreciated and fulfilled . There are difference in educational programs , work , setting job"
No," clients need and all the needs of the client is mentioned in the clients care plan . Remember this clients care plan is also called nursing care plan . We have to see the nursing care plan before we approach the client , for example . What time we have to feed the"
No," client , what time we have to give them sour , what time we have to make them ready and what time we have to transfer them from bed to the wheelchair or wheelchair to the bed , like everything is mentioned in the nursing Care plan : that is why our main focus is always the"
No," client 's care and we have to meet the client 's need , and our guideline is the nursing care plan . We have to follow . That 'S the mandatory , that 's the compulsory thing . If Cooper practice , it is our job description . What is the scope of practice support the personal support"
No," Ontario . We are called personal support worker our support worker or healthcare aide and in other provinces . The name may be the different , the setting for support work . We work in a varieties of agency based and community based setting . There are basically two type of setting we"

Environment," clients home . It is called community when we work in the hospital when we work in the long term care it is called facility or agency based in all settings . We have to ensure the safety of the client remember safety . First , safety is always the numberone concern"
No," everywhere , no matter where we work , including those with the cognitive cognitive means , mental functioning , cognitive or mental health challenges . Those clients who are mentally unable to make the good decision of their healthcare their choices , their life or"
Environment, and at that time we have to ensure the client safety . That is always the numberone priority . We may also assist the clients with the social support or social reintegration . We have to support the client in the social reintegration . What I mean by social reintegration
No," , social reintegration means to reintroducing the client in the social mainstream society with their friends and family . For example . A client is having the issue of paralysis . We are working as a support worker . We are helping the client a lot . We are"
No," regularly making them aware of their medication . We are working with with the broader healthcare team . There are occupational therapists physiotherapists , there are nurses , community reintegration program , we have to go them , go there with client and we have to assist the client"
No," in every moment and the client gradually recovers from the illness and client becomes independent person and the client once again reintroduces . In the society with the friends and family , this is called social reintegration . In this situation , our job is very , very"
No," significant . We have to provide comfort and endoflife care . This is the comfort and endoflife care . Remember this comfort and endoflife care . There is a word palliative care . You may have this word palliative care , palliative care is the care given to the Indus stage of"
No," life to the person . It is given more and more comfort to the people and making the end of life very , very easier for the client , which is not easier for . We worker and for the family member , but we try our best to give them as comfort as possible , and this is called a care to the dying"
No," responsibility . This is a very rewarding job , and so many people , like hundreds and thousands of people , are enjoying this job loving this job and working as a personal support worker . We have to begin our care from the personal care . Remember they see the first and foremost"
No," thing we have to restart our key from the personal care it involves , assisting with the activities of daily living , which we say we call ADL 's activities of daily living that combines those activities like eating bathing . It 'S called bathing . It 'S a grooming"
No," , another is grooming , grooming dressing them , giving them twice what dress they like for the day , taking them for the toileting toileting it it covers bowel movement and bladder movement . Moving and positioning . Remember repositioning every two hour . This is a formula for we"
No," developing Pressure also and pressure ulcer is one of the most common and very very serious health issue nowadays . Similarly , we assist with the instrumental activities of daily living . Here we talk about the ADL 's activities of daily living . Here we are talking"
No," about activities through mental activities of daily living , see the instrumental . It also combines the activity that you have to do even more job in the community setting or in the facility setting taking their garments their clothing for the laundry making"
No," them break fast . Propelling their preparing their meals and help as per needed in the community setting , which is called instrumental activities of daily living it . It also covers going for their grocery , helping them in paying their"
No, bills and all other activities . It is even broader than the activities of daily living not responsible for deciding what should or should not be done must absorb and report the changes in the client 's behavior . Remember whatever is the activity we involve in
No," , we may be involving in the activities of daily lives or we may be , involving in the instrumental activities of daily living in the community . Setting whatever is the responsibility we are given and we have to fulfill . There is a biggest responsibility we must . We must absorb"
No, people . We assist the nurses and other health care providers by following the established care plan . We already talked about the care plan . We another name of the care plan is nursing care plan . The nurses prepared this nursing her plan as per the need of the client
No," , and we have to work with the nursing care plan or the care plan for each client . Each client is special . Each client has a different their own need and each client has their own dignity . We have to respect as individual . We never ever generalize our clients ."
No," many chances to clarify the work . If you do not know the work clarify with the nurses clarify with the supervisor for the community setting , you can call them , you have a telephone or cell phone facility or you have a email . You can do email . You have so many communication"
No, facility . You can utilize to get clarify family support . We may have to involve in the family support when we work in the community . We are working under the supervision of the families member the loved one of the family members . It is there like reflect
No," the situation . Suppose you are working with the 90 years old , client and all other family members . Are there that client is their grandfather or grandmother . We have to respect the clients , love for the loved one and how they expect our job . We have to provide"
No," them , we have to meet their expectation and we need to . We need to expect with some time we can expect family support also , and we are always ready to give the family support as well : social support , CCAC and other social organization government organization . They are coming"
No," to the home and supporting the clients need , and we have to do the social support as well and housekeeping . This is a biggest job in the community setting in the facility setting . Also , there are certain jobs of housekeeping , but in the community"
No," setting personal support workers are supposed to do the housekeeping job and home management . You have to manage the kitchen go for grocery by the grocery and come follow . The care plan report any changes and so on . People use support , who are the people you support ? What are the"
No," or residential facility , a person living in the residential facility . We call them resident a client when we call poor color person , a client person receiving care or support services in the community , see the client with community . Remember this terminology , just"
No," understanding them in combining together client and community in the community setting . We call them client , general term for the all people receiving health care or support services , those people who live in the community , their own home or apartment , and they receive the health"
No," nursing , home , long term , long term , care , home , etc and client is individual ? Who live in the community means either their own home or in the apartment , building rental building condominium building ? Whatever is the facility ? Not the facility ? Whatever is the community they"
No," clients , our resident or patients caring for individuals older . So these are the individuals we support . Worker are supposed to care older adults , older adults who live in the community , our facility or in the hospital setting , no matter where they live , but older adult"
No," people in their advanced age . These are the people , elderly people . There are different , terminologies being used for these people . We are looking after them . We are giving them care , as they need people with disability , certain neurological disorder and mental health"
No," and so on . In those medical condition , we have to help them . We have to follow their care plan and we have to help them under the supervision of the nurses and other health care professional . Similarly , people have been surgery before the surgery and after the surgery we meet"
No," with mental health problem . Nowadays , mental health issue is coming as an alarming problem : health issue and such as anxiety , disorder , depression , disorder , schizophrenia and so on . There are so many mental health condition . We also have to work in the mental health"
Environment," hospital , certain neurological condition like dementia and Alzheimer 's disease . There are so many types of those disease we may have to work with those people , people needing rehabilitation . Who are the people rehabilitating the people who have certain health condition who have"
Environment," gone for the surgical procedure ? And they are still in the phase of recovery and they are put in the rehab . Rehab is in the hospital side , every hospital they have their rehabilitation center , where the patients are taught how to use wheelchair , how to use certain prosthesis ."
Environment," These people taught the peasants are taught in the rehabilitation , and maybe we need to work in the rehabilitation , centers Sylvan , for example , if we work in the sick in hospital , we may be working with a small children , schoolaged children"
No," , teenage boys and girls and so on . So we have to be very careful while working with the children , because they are sometime , they are difficult and sometimes they are easier as well . Mothers and newborns . These are every hospital has a maternity section and the"
Environment, maternity area we may have to work with a mother and newborns . We need to have a special knowledge for that and if we go to work those section we will be given some extra trainings before we start our job there in those sections and people requiring special care . Some people who
No," require special care , like the people with a mental health and other mental physiological condition , therefore , no matter where we work , we may be working with so many varieties of people with their health condition , their neurological condition , their mental"
No," perform there we play , but the ultimate aim of our role is to provide the quality care to give them dignity to provide them their their need . As mentioned in the care plan , the support worker is an important member of the healthcare team . As we already discussed"
Environment," that sets education that determines what type of education and they also provide them the license requirements . The college establishes the scope of practice course of ethics and standard of conducts for its member . All the nurses , like the colleges of nurses of"
Environment," Ontario . It is called C and colleges of nurses of Ontario . That is the college of all the nurses in Ontario . The college determines the education level , College gives them the license and so on . They also determines what is the code of ethics ? What is a standard of practice of"

No, hours safe to allow received . It depends on the facility 's policy and what type of planning and provision is there . We have to follow the supervisor . We have to follow the nursing care plan . We have to follow the care plan . We have to follow the employers policies we have to have
No," They do the assessment . They develop nursing care plan . As we already discuss about that nursing care plan . They do the implements according to the nursing care plan , they do , they do the implements and they evaluate whether the care providing provided to the client is effective or"
No," uniform you wear all the in healthcare workers . They are supposed to wear their own uniform , which is the Scarb and the pant . They have to be professional . To look at be cheerful , you have to be healthy , happy and friendly . You have to be friendly , not the friend . There is a"
No," difference between be to be a friend and to be friendly , be friendly with everybody , not the friend . Usually we healthcare worker must be friendly with with all our clients , but we do n't develop personal friendship with the clients work . When is scheduled"
No," and help other . We are always stretching our hands to help other people . You have to so curiosity enthusiasm of learning , something new ideas , consideration you have to think it as it is , and you have to display honesty . Honesty is the best policy . As long as you are honest , you are"
No," of responsibility once we are given the assignment to provide care for the kid for the resident , and we have to do as the care plan says , as the nursing supervisor says . That 'S our responsibility . We are accountable and we have to take the accountability of our"
No," action means we have to be responsible and we have to take the responsibility of our every action , a professional appearance , your your appearance is the mirror . Other people see on it . If your appearance is positive opinions , if you look professional well groomed properly"
No," information with anybody , but with your healthcare team they will be sharing the information . For example , you can not talk about your client with your family member , with your husband with your wife , with your friends in the Tim Hortons in the elevator in the stair . No we 're not"

Environment," Every year , harmful use of alcohol is responsible for three million deaths and five percent of the global health burden from road traffic , injuries to violence , abuse and neglect to diseases like liver cirrhosis"
No," , heart disease , cancers and tuberculosis to mental health issues like alcohol dependence , depression and suicides . But what can we do about it ? Well , the who 's global strategy endorsed by member states"
No," , aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol . Unfortunately , implementation of the strategy is uneven , meet nina in her country . There are very few government regulations on drinking nina is out with a friend the alcohol is cheaper than bottled water"
No," and the bar stays open till 4am , so people are encouraged to stay out late and drink . More nina 's friend falls and hurts herself now meet amir . Her government has introduced pricing measures on alcohol and there 's a mandatory closing time for"
No," bars , which means amy and her friend leave for home at midnight . Amy decides to take a taxi because the police in her country are very active in enforcing drink driving countermeasures , but in nina 's country the police do n't"
No," enforce drink driving walls at all , so she decides to drive her friend home . She is way over the limit and crashes . Her car nina and her friend are taken to hospital using up the time and resources of busy nurses and doctors ."

No," of adults have drank alcohol in their life. It's an extremely popular drug that decreases specific neuronal excitation in your brain with biological byproducts that have a huge impact on your body. So if you're wanting to partake in a bevy, short for beverage,"
No," is there an ideal time for your physiology? Is it better to day drink or drink at night? When you drink a shot of vodka, 20% of the alcohol is absorbed by the stomach, 80% in the small intestine, where it goes into your bloodstream, then to your liver to be metabolized."
No," Ethanol gets into cells by passive diffusion. So the more you drink, the faster you get drunk. And when alcohol accumulates and finally gets to your brain, it suppresses the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which causes information transfer in the brain to become slower with only the largest signals making it through."
No," You feel less, perceive less, notice less, and remember less. So a check for drinking at night is that day drinking alcohol won't allow you to complete your daily tasks. A check for day drinking is that we've been doing it for millions of years."
No," Known as the Drunk Monkey Hypothesis, the only reason you're able to drink alcohol right now dates back to a gene mutation that occurred 10 million years ago in your ancestors. A monkeylooking eutherian mammal, which is the common ancestor to you and the chimpanzee, of course,"
No," had a mutation in their enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase, which made this enzyme 40 times more effective at metabolizing alcohol. This specific mutation in the alcoholic dehydrogenase meant that no longer would small amounts of alcohol be poisonous but now it could be a viable energy source. This hypothesis also recognizes"
No," but sometimes they allow us humans to get absolutely sloshed, bro. And our ancestors were likely eating these fermented fruits during the day. They were also getting lots of new energy. But while drinking alcohol may increase your caloric energy, and while day drinking you might be like kinda giddy,"
No," like shotsonthepatio energy, like woohoo, that will quickly go away and you will become a lethargic afternoon mess, which kind of creates a check for drinking at night. Any excited extroversion you feel while drinking is due to the suppression of brain firing in the prefrontal cortex."
No," This part of your brain controls your impulses and restrains behavior. Therefore, alcohol suppressing this inhibitory part of your brain causes you to loosen up and become a bit more extroverted. For example, once while drunk, I became very extroverted and invited everyone in my university residence"
No," In your liver is where the famous enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase lives. And it breaks down the ethanol into acetaldehyde. The buildup of acetaldehyde causes incoordination, memory problems, and sleepiness. So day drinking leads to these byproducts building up in your body during the day,"
No," is that it negatively affects your sleep. Since we now know that alcohol inhibits the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, when alcohol leaves your system, the brain kind of overcorrects and there's a rebound of glutamate, which leads to excitability and irritation."
No," Drinking at night means this excitable rebound happens when you're trying to sleep. This ends up dismantling your sleep through the night, cutting it up into tiny little bits and actually interrupting your sleep cycle in a way that a lot of people don't even realize is happening."
No," But you may be saying, ""But alcohol helps me get to sleep."" But electrical brainwaves show that sleeping while intoxicated is not natural sleep. It's more sedated, similar to anesthesia. In fact, alcohol is one of the strongest sedatives of the integral REM sleep, the type of sleep which causes dreams."
No," When the liver metabolizes alcohol, it produces ketones and aldehydes. The aldehydes block the brainwaves needed to generate this powerful REM dream sleep, which can have astounding effects. REM sleep is so essential for a lot of functions in your body and brain, including memory and association."
No," a second group got a little drunk every night before bed on two to three shots of vodka, which was based on their body weight; and a third group slept naturally on day one to two and then had alcohol before bed starting on day three. Seven days later and they were all tested again. People in the control group without alcohol at night"
No, to metabolize the alcohol so you can get a good sleep. A check for day drinking for sure. Some people argue that day drinking a mimosa with the sweethearts or knocking back a cold brewski with the boys makes them feel better than having a dark whiskey on the rocks at night while talking about philosophy.
No, But does the type of alcohol that you're drinking affect how you enjoy it? One survey found individuals reported higher negative expectancies after drinking shots of distilled spirits and higher positive expectancies after drinking wine and beer.
No," Another study found that 29.8% of respondents reported feeling aggressive when drinking spirits. Spirits is such a weird word for a type of alcohol. There is no physiological evidence the type of alcohol you are drinking affects your mood, but instead it's how you perceive the alcohol will affect you that affects you."
No," A really important thing is your mood prior to starting to drink. It will be exacerbated by the effects of the alcohol. So for example, if you are a day drinking on a Sunday and extremely anxious about having to work on the Monday, you're not gonna enjoy your time. Whereas if it's a Friday night, you're kicked back,"
No," you're done work and you're having a brew, that's gonna be a bit more fun. An iconic check for day drinking is that it usually means you'll be getting to eat a meal. And who doesn't wanna eat more food? Food plays a huge role in how alcohol is absorbed. If you have food in your stomach,"
No," it absorbs some of the alcohol instead of going directly into the bloodstream and physically slows it from reaching the small intestine where, with its large surface area, a lot of alcohol is absorbed very quickly. So day drinking with food means you get drunk less fast. But in the end, alcohol is pretty physiologically,"
No," disgusting, dangerous, and quite addictive drug. Excessive chronic alcohol intake leads to neurological disorders, cardiovascular disorders, liver disease, cancer, et cetera. If you wanna remember things, perceive the world around you, be coordinated, get a good night's sleep, you're gonna have to skip alcohol altogether."
No," If I had to choose one, I'm kind of stumped because I don't love day drinking 'cause I feel gross, but I care so much about my sleep that I don't like drinking at night knowing it's gonna mess everything up. Sound like you shouldn't drink at all. (laughs) Yeah. Like maybe I just need to stop drinking."
No," I think it's like FOMO is what makes me wanna day drink. If you wanna watch us get intoxicated and talk on our podcast about alcohol even more, we'll put links on the screen or in the description below. Make sure you're subscribed. And we will see you in a few weeks for a new science video. Peace."
No," Today 'S topic is : what are the effects of alcohol on your body ? It 'S wrong to think that you 're immune to alcohol 's effects , if you do n't feel anything after your first few sips , the substance takes some time to take hold , but it starts to affect your body"
No," right away . The buzz , the slight headache and the hangover the next day are all pretty common . However , regularly drinking alcohol can also end up affecting your body . These health effects show up quickly for those"
No," who binge drink but can show up gradually for people who drink regularly , even if they do n't drink too much . Here 'S what your body might have to go through because of alcohol . Shortterm effects of alcohol , some temporary effects that you might notice"
No," , while drinking alcohol or right after include the following 1. feeling , giddy or euphoric 2. feeling relaxed or drowsy 3. feeling impulsive 4. frequent changes in mood 5. lowered , inhibition"

No," Eleven changes in perception , vision and hearing twelve trouble , focusing 13. inability to make decisions ; 14. loss of consciousness , 15. gaps in memory called blackouts ."
No," Some of these become less intense , as you continue drinking while others may become more pronounced . However , these effects are shortterm and do go away once the effect of alcohol wears off . It is the longterm effects of alcohol"
No," that pose a risk to your health . Longterm effects of alcohol , some of the simpler longterm effects of alcohol include 1. insomnia and sleeping concerns , 2. anxiety and other persistent mood"
No," changes . Three changes in appetite causing weight gain four compromised immune system , five changes in sexual activity and function;"

No," 6 affect your sexual life by reducing libido 7. reduced bone density. Alcohol can also cause longterm conditions, such as alcoholinduced bipolar disorder and several psychotic"
No," and sleep disorders. Finally, you are likely to become dependent on the drug. The increased tolerance will make you drink more to get the same buzz and you will find it difficult to function without it soon. After."
No," Health , it 's the state of complete physical , mental and social wellbeing , not just the absence of disease or infirmity , and good health is something we strive to achieve , not just individually but also as a community . But if we look around us our family friends"
No," and others , we know that health is very variable . For example , in 2016 the life expectancy of a child born in sierra leone was 53 years , while in australia it was 83 years , but even within australia . The life expectancy of indigenous people is about"
Environment," 10 years lower than that of nonindigenous people and even within a specific group of people , health can change based on a person 's income level of education or occupation . So why is health so variable"
No," as in health behaviors , such as smoking , physical activity , alcohol use and diet . Health is also largely influenced by the conditions in which people are born , grow , live work and age collectively called the social determinants of health ."
No," : structural and intermediary . Structural determinants are the socioeconomic and political context that people live in . It includes governance , economic , social and public policies , and also the social and cultural values placed on health issues ."
Environment," These factors can lead to the unequal distribution of material and monetary resources , which can shape a person 's socioeconomic position . Socioeconomic position is characterized by education , occupation , income , gender , race or ethnicity and social class ."
Environment," means to buy healthy food , clothing or other requirements for healthy living and work environment . Psychosocial factors like stressful living circumstances , relationships and social support , behavioral and biological factors in addition to these health"
Environment," , but can be complex , interdependent and interact in many different ways to influence health , for example , or income can limit opportunities for achieving good health and , conversely , poor health can limit opportunities for people to participate"
No," Did you know that astronauts in space have a hard time communicating without words because their weightless bodily fluids make their faces all puffy and hard to read? Have you heard that Botox can actually improve your mood, and not by smoothing wrinkles but actually by easing depression?"
No," Or not. The powers of both positivity and negativity are stronger than you may know. Lots of studies have shown that people with a positive outlook on life tend to live longer, more fulfilling lives than their mean and grumpy neighbors. Fear, anger, and other more difficult emotions"
No," and how we handle them are pretty closely related to this thing called stress. And stress is so powerful that it can straight up kill you in any number of ways, given the right opportunity. For better or worse we spend a lot of our lives swirling around like leaves on the winds of competing emotions. Before we can hope to harness"
No," reading nonverbal cues and subtle expressions. The understanding among some, but not all, psychologists, like emotion expert Paul Ekman, is that facial expressions are culturally universal. So a Greek, Britain, American, Samoan, or Nigerian would all be able to discern the same basic emotions; happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, and surprise,"
No," controlled clinical trial suggested that a little Botox injection in the forehead might actually lessen depression. 'Cause it's apparently hard to feel down if your frowny muscles are frozen. Of course whether your face is paralyzed or not, some people are better at reading your emotions than others."
No," but you don't want to flip it around in the UK. And the iconic thumbs up gesture means ""good job"" in many cultures, but if you toss that thumb around in Greece, well let's just say you won't make any new friends. But of course emotions involve a lot more than making faces and hand gestures, they're also about our"
No," conscious experience of what we're feeling. So how do we actually feel all these feels, and how many different emotions are there? Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Carol Izard identified ten distinct basic human emotions present from infancy on. They are: joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust,"
No," contempt, shame, fear, guilt, and interest or excitement. Others have since suggested that ""pride"" should be added to that list, and still others believe that love should be classified as a basic emotion as well, but Izard has argued that these and other emotions are just familiar combinations of the classic ten. Today, some psychologists describe our emotional"
No," combination of negative emotion and lack of excitement. So potentially every emotion can fall in degrees on this 2dimensional scale. Like being terrified means you're more frightened than if you're just scared, just as being enraged is a more extreme form of anger than simply being mad. These polaritiespositive versus negative, high arousal versus low arousalaffect our psychological"
No," states, and therefore our bodies as well. Because, you'll remember that what is psychological is ultimately biological. And when it comes to the physical effects of our emotions, it pretty much goes the way you might expect. Happiness is helpful while chronic anger or depression makes us vulnerable to all kinds of problems with health and wellbeing. The good news is that if"
No," we're angry or sad, we often overestimate the duration of our bad moods and underestimate our capacity to adapt and bounce back from traumas, even if things feel hopeless, depressing, or stressful in the thick of it. And we've all experienced stress before, sometimes on a daily or even hourly basis. Much like anger or joy,"
No," stressors, that we view as challenging or threatening. In other words, stress isn't technically an emotion, it's more of a reaction to a disturbing or disruptive stimulus. And our reactions stem in part from our appraisal of that stimulus. A person can either roll with, or get worked up about a missed flight, an increased workload, or a strange thump in the house. These external stressors"
Environment," typically fall into three main categories: catastrophes, or unpredictable large scale events like war, natural disasters and terrorist attacks; significant life changes, things like moving, having a child, losing or getting a job, or the death of a loved on; and then just everyday inconveniences like getting caught in traffic, running late, or feuding with your roommates."
No," are what get your organ systems to respond the way you need them to when you're getting charged by a bear, or focusing really hard on the gas law for your chemistry test. But to also why chronic stress can really wreck a body and mind, research has shown that abused children have a high risk of chronic disease and people suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder,"
No," PTSD, which we'll talk about in an upcoming episode, experience higher rates of digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and infectious diseases. A lot of these negative connections between your body's systems have to do with the fact that many of its most basic functions, like blood pressure, breathing, body temperature, digestion, and heartbeat, are in part"
No," explains how stress causes digestive problems, because when that werewolf pops out of the bushes and a wave of cortisol washes through you, your body wants to focus its energy on sending blood to your muscles so that you can react quickly. Which is good, right? But it may do that partly by shutting down digestion"
No," nervous system is redirecting all of its energy sources to your muscles and brain, it pulls flow away from your other organs. And one of those organs is the liver, whose job includes removing the fat and cholesterol from your blood. So basically, when a stressed liver can't filter properly, that extra fat and cholesterol ends up circulating in your blood, which can settle"
No," finishing their work. And physiologically speaking, it's worth pointing out that some close relatives to stress, when it comes to their effects on the body, are pessimism and depression, which also have been linked to stress and heart disease. Many types of studies have found that people characterized by their optimism, happiness, love, and"
No," positive feelings often live significantly longer than their grumpy, dour counterparts. Researchers don't quite know exactly how chronic negative emotional states influence health, but it may be some combination of lifestyle or behavioral factors, like neglecting your health, or not taking your heart meds when you're feeling blue, or social factors like the way the depression"
No," can be isolating and thus prevent others from helping you out. Or biological factors, like increases in certain kinds of inflammatory proteins released by the immune system in response to stress and sadness. So in the end, while stress may not directly cause disease, you could say that the two walk handinhand. In that way, it isn't a stretch to say that chronic stress"
No," communicate. We also looked at the 2dimensional model of emotional experience and how anger, happiness, and depression can affect our health. We also discussed what stress does to your nervous system and how chronic stress can damage the functioning of your biological systems. Thanks for watching, especially to our Subbable"
No," Don'T listen ! I understand anyway . Okay , so I 'm just going to try and find out a little bit more about you . So I understand that you 're , an English student at uni , yeah and you live away from home with some friends . Is that right , yeah ?"
No," Yeah ? Okay ? So you , do n't you , do n't it far from the Uni and but you say you feel , like you live with your friends , but you do n't feel like you can talk to them .

No," it and you 're noticing sleep problems as well , and then what do you do so this is so we 're back to the point before the lecture , so you start having these thoughts , these emotions - and you know your body . I guess it sounds like those thoughts quite draining , so we draining"
No," your energy . What then happens what you do next and I kind of focus on the negative thoughts when I probably should not think about them , but it I focus on them and then I do n't really want to do anything . Can I"

No," First you need to know something about what your emotions are. You have different basic emotions, some of which arouse you. And some that calm you Down. These are shame.. These are shame. Fear. Sadness… Anger… Disgust…"
No," Like feeling hopeless, irritated, anxious, exited, lonely, embarrassed, suspicious, content and so on. These feelings all arise from your basic emotions. For instance, feeling suspicious springs from fear. And feeling lonely springs from sadness. And then it gets complicated. Emotions do not always provide you and your surroundings with good information. Sometimes you fake emotions to get what you want."
No," your painful emotion. At other times again, your “real” emotions are messed up, and make a lot of trouble for you. If you were scared a lot when you were a child. You might grow up having a core feeling of being afraid. You might overprotect yourself, so that no one can hurt you ever again. Everyone who was hurt badly as a child has a deep need to feel safe,"
No," and a desire for someone to love them and connect with them. And heavy protection doesn’t give you this. You can tell or show someone you trust, that you are afraid. You can welcome the feeling of being afraid and listen to it, instead of ignoring it and covering it up. And the fear will then become more manageable. You can also change fear by means of selfcompassion"
No," and assertive anger. You can protect stand up for yourself, without driving people away. You can handle criticism, even if it hurts. You can to take the chance, and let people in, even if you are afraid of getting hurt again. You feel and function better when you are aware of and deal with your “real” emotions, even if they are painful. Your real emotions help you get to what you really need, both from yourself and others."
No," Let me come back to the rage for a second , because i would love to get your advice or at least hear of some of your learnings over the last decades , because i recall from our first conversation that"
No," learned about rage and anger ? How do you relate to it or metabolize it , and i ask as someone who has a long history of running on anger as a maybe a corrosive fuel of sorts , so i would . I would love to just hear you expand on that in any way . That"
No," They include care , he capitalized these . So you see a re care , then something he caused grief and panic , then fear lust"
No," the anger that arises when our boundaries are being transgressed . If i were to infringe on your boundaries , either physically or emotionally , the healthy response for you"
No," is to mount an anger response . No get out stay away . That 'S healthy , healthy anger is in the moment it protects your boundaries and then it 's gone ."
No," It 'S not necessary anymore . However , if your boundaries were infringed as a child , but you could not express it , it does n't disappear , it gets suppressed"
No," mention it , but you 've , some time after you and i talked you actually publicly acknowledged that you 'd been sexually abused as a child yeah . I did now"
No," when that 's happening to a small child . The last thing you can afford is to is to be angry , because if you get rageful at the boundary invasion , you 're gon na get hurt even more so suppressing that rage becomes a"
Environment," survival mechanism , nothing wrong with it . It 'S the right thing to do you do n't do it , your brain will do it for you automatically as a way of preserving your life or your your relative safety"
No," , but it 's a response to the past and just as my hurt and sense of abandonment and enrage was triggered by my wife , not picking me up at the airport , so a person 's rage can be Triggered by something relatively minor"
No," , but all of a sudden , this lava flow just explodes out of you and the difference between healthy anger and by the way , suppressing healthy anger is also unhealthy for you . We can talk about that , but"
No, just as healthy anger expresses itself does its job and then it 's gone rage . The way such as i 'm describing such as the way i used to experience it and probably as used to experience it the more it explodes the bigger it gets .
No," healthy anger on the one hand , which is an essential boundary defense and by the way , so much parenting advice in this culture tells parents to force kids to suppress their anger , really unhealthy advice and"
No," there 's healthy Anger then , there 's that rage that you and i have both experienced that to work with that . No , it 's look if you 're gon na punch a human being"
No," How do you approach the processing , what is a more effective prescription or one possible way of thinking about it or approaching it ? Well , if i was working with you , i would encourage you to fully experience the body experience of rage"

No," story . Many months ago I had a patient with health anxiety and she had a fear of having a brain tumor . So she went to a doctor . She went had an MRI and as she waited for the results of course , she was extremely anxious , nervous and went to"
No," her doctor to find out the results . The doctor told her . Everything was negative . You have no issues , there was no brain tumor . Everything was fine . You have no reason to be worried , but if you 're concerned come back in six months , so of course she was relieved , so she went home"
No," another round of worrying . So , even though the MRI was negative , she still wound up becoming very , very anxious , and that is why health anxiety is very tricky . We'Re going to talk about the other tricky aspects of this disorder . What is health anxiety and what"
No," are the strategies you can implement to overcome it and we have a special guest today we invited Stephanie on Stephanie is a former health anxiety sufferer , and she is going to chime in throughout this talk that I 'm giving and share from Her perspective from the patient 's"
No," perspective , what it took to overcome this disorder , so Stephanie welcome yeah . Thank you , I 'm happy to be here . So there is actually no official diagnosis called health anxiety , the actual there 's actually two diagnoses in the DSM : the"
No," diagnosis , mystical manual , it 's illness , anxiety and somatic symptom disorder . The primary distinction between the two is the presence of somatic symptoms that are distressing or significantly disrupt your life so and you 're talking about physical symptoms in the body , yeah"
No," physical symptoms , so pain , neurological stuff , like weakness or lightheadedness , digestive symptoms such as diarrhea cramping , any sort Of like acid reflux or chest pressure that you might feel racing hard , so these are all somatic symptoms , whereas the illness anxiety , you"
No," anxiety , which are going to encompass both of them by the way we 're going to try to get through as much as we can in this PowerPoint . If we ca n't get through the whole thing , we 'll have a part two . So we 'll get to everything : okay , so there is"
No," a preoccupation with having or acquiring a silent serious illness . So what I mean having like you , actually believe that you have some sort of serious illness or there 's a fear that you 're going to acquire that it 's going to happen , someday , possibly imminent , possibly in"
No," difficulty breathing all sorts of physical symptoms as well as an excessive amount of time devoted to those symptoms and health worries . So a lot of what , if thinking , imagining worstcase scenarios preoccupation with your symptoms and your worries ? That 'S a"
No," lot of time devoted to it and then there 's a lot of behaviors related to that . So regular visits to the doctor , medical tests may be taking too much medicine or a lot of reassurance seeking . So you go to your spouse and you say : hey . I have this feeling here : what do you"
No," think it is so you 're getting reassurance , maybe scanning your body looking for things and then there 's a lot of compulsive checking . So I have a patient currently who have fear of this blood pressure being too high . So there 's a you"
No," there 's a lot of behaviors related to this disorder and , finally avoidance fear of going to the doctor . Some people go to the doctor too much and other people avoid the doctor completely because they do n't want the bad news . Maybe they are we trying medicines because they 're"
Environment," afraid of side effects ? Maybe you know they feel physical symptoms . They do n't want to leave the house , you do n't want to exercise , they do n't want to watch certain things because they 're afraid they might see something that might"
No," trigger their anxiety . So these are the primary characteristics of health anxiety . So can I jump yeah sure just see as you 're going through it ? It 'S it 's so funny , because it really reads as a textbook , I 'm kind of laughing to myself as you 're going through it in a way of"
No," explained it perfectly yeah by the way for our audience , Stephanie was not my patient . She was somewhat my colleague of mine patients , so we 're actually meeting . We had just met for the first time a couple weeks ago . So I 'm glad you share that yeah ."
No," you 've been medically ruled out for everything what 's left , is really helping xiety . So what underlies all anxiety it does n't matter what your anxiety is , whether it 's public speaking or fear of going in closed spaces or spiders or fear of driving or social anxiety"
No, or health anxiety . There 'S two things that underlie all anxiety : these are the roots and anxieties . We'Ll talk about these a lot and the first one is an intolerance of uncertainty . You ca n't tolerate a certain set of uncertain situations and for health anxiety . Is
No," it 's uncertain like what is this mole ? You know what is it I do n't know , I 'm uncertain and the other one is an intolerance of distress like you feel that distress and you ca n't tolerate that either . So those are the hallmarks of all anxiety disorders , no matter what"
No," you have and OCD . So what causes the fear of illness ? Well , it 's similar to what cause anxiety and everybody genetics play a huge role . You know , genes that are passed down from one generation to the next . Also , just living with an anxious parent"
No," who is anxious about illness can create anxiety , and if you have a parent - and you grew up with a parent who is constantly worrying about their own illness , you may pick up on a lot of those worries and assume them For yourself , maybe you had a loved one who suffered with an illness"
No," , so you just focus on the words right now . Oh , but what about later discharge instructions ? I 'M a patient of mine just showed me his discharge instructions , I 'm gon na read it read one to you is it . You know he has a little bit of high blood pressure , primarily because of anxiety"
No," discharge . Instructions can scare people and finally lab values outside the normal range , so your blood pressure might be a little eye or your cholesterol might be a little off and that just can really trigger it . Stephanie . Finally , one more sorry one"
No," waiting for test results , so you 've just had a test , and I got ta wait wait week for results . We'Re gon na have Stephanie something yeah . Can you relate Stephanie yeah ? I just I 'm just like with every point . I 'M just remembering different things . You know you mentioned the lab"
No," values . You know . I remember looking at my white blood count and I called my doctor and I was like : why is that low and she 's like no , no Stephanie , you look at the whole picture . You look at you know : it 's not just the one I 'm like yeah , but of course , then I 'm online looking up . Why"
Environment," , fortunately so yeah . So it 's all . Oh right on yeah , okay , so once you 're triggered lots of different things might happen from there one you might start avoiding like I 'm feeling something my heart , I 'm not going to exercise . Maybe I 'm not going to"
No," go out . Maybe I 'm not gon na . I do n't want to see people , because if I see people they might talk about some disease , I 'm a boy go to the doctor , there 's also a dwelling and worrying so once your Twitter triggered your start thinking about it over and over and over . So you"
No," emailing your doctor 's talk to your spouse , you 're getting tests and then finally , once you 're triggered , you can experience physical symptoms . We'Re going to talk about this right now why physical symptoms are triggered once you have something that just sort of"
No," However , adrenaline also causes lots of physical symptoms and anxiety , tons of physical symptoms like racing hard wrap and Paul 's tight niche in your tap chest . Difficulty breathing lightheadedness sweating muscle tension , so many physical symptoms are caused by adrenaline , and"
No," these physical symptoms are also symptoms of medical illnesses , so it makes it very tricky very , very tricky , so you can feel like a tightness in your throat . Well , what 's that ? Well , remembering adrenaline can cause muscle tension throughout anywhere in your body"
No," anywhere from here into your chest down in your abdomen , so it causes so many physical symptoms and people that can easily get fooled , but it 's very predictable . It 'S like other physical . It says like other substances , so what would happen if someone drank what would"
No," happen if someone drank too much coffee ? What happened ? Anyone , anyone Bueller ? No , you may get shaky and jittery right and what would happen if someone drank too much alcohol ? Well , you would start slurring . Your speech feeling offbalance right . It 'S predictable , it 's the same"
No," leading to maybe a whole bunch of different bodily somatic sensations yeah . It just reinforces what you 're already thinking you know for someone who has a heart worried . It 'S gon na make your heart race , which is going to make you believe that you 're having a heart issue right"
No," highlight the first part is the prefrontal cortex , which is in charge of logical thinking and reasoning right up here . The other part is the amygdala , which is a small almond , shaped kind of the mid part of the brain which has to do with emotional reactions . They called"
No," hijacks the entire brain . So you ca n't even think clearly so any rational thinking that you would possibly would be able to do when your amygdala fires off and you start to feel those physical symptoms . It 'S hard to think . Logically , it 's think of a you know . You put a piece"
No," really a sign of danger , it just is triggered and it just it just sounds off fire fire , which basically is what happens when people have health anxiety are all two forms of anxiety . Actually so the brain is made up of billions of neurons"
No," good or bad , as well as Repetition , so it 's just like repetition , repetitive lifting , will strengthen your muscles . You know repetitive behaviors change and strengthen the neuronal connections in your brain , so , for instance , typing you know when you 're first learning how to"
No, your brain and exacerbated your anxiety about illness and death . You are an anxiety expert with all the practice and that 's basically what happens and people have all sorts of anxiety . So here is the question : how do you conquer health anxiety when you are genetically
No," you 've , got ta talk to people and make sure that , like Ken said that they 're really qualified and They really understand that specific anxiety that you 're dealing with okay , you can easily tell by their website . If you just go in the person 's website , if they primarily"
No," talk about anxiety or OCD , you know you can tell the heart : that 's what their specialty is . If they talk about doing marriage , counseling and selfesteem building and all that stuff depression , and then you know , you know that kind of a generalist they treat everything . Well"
No," , I think that 's not able to , I think , that 's kind of the struggle to with when you 're looking for a therapist , especially if you 're looking for someone under your health insurance . You know you get these long lists of a lot of therapists who have you know 25"
No," office . But I think the I think it 's great , that we have the that we can do it via zoom and via all these different avenues , because we , then you can get the best treatment . Yeah , a daa actually has a list of therapists who do video conferencing on the website . Okay , so our"
Environment," bodies are naturally noisy all sorts of things . I mean this is natural and I think sometimes , when you have how things I you expect there to be no noise , but that 's unrealistic , and all this is just a partial list of the things that that can happen on a regular basis . And if you"
No," have anxiety , you are going to experience more physical symptoms because of adrenaline , because you 're constantly worrying about things which is signaling , the adrenal gland and the amygdala , and so you 're gon na feel . Your body is going to be noisier than the average person ."
No," of went on for a little bit , but then it went away and the world is a noisy place . So we talked about these things . You know news about health scares , Facebook posts , no friends that talked about relatives that have had diseases , so the world is a noisy place . Your body is a noisy place ."
No," It 'S easily triggered and anxiety is filled with inner struggle and earth . Inert or you know , inner turmoil should I go to the doctor . Is this a new mall ? Does it look different than the old ones ? Why is my blood pressure , so why should I take it again ? Maybe the doctor missed"
No," something . Maybe it 's not acid reflux , maybe my cholesterol is not in the normal range . Should I be concerned so there 's constant inner struggle and inner turmoil when you have health anxiety - and I want you to start looking at anxiety from a different point of"
No," view . You know the problem that people have with anxiety is they 're trying to solve the problem of anxiety from the same perspective that created the problem . Let 'S shift your point of view , so you can look at the problem in a different way"
No," and the way I want you to look at it is instead of struggling with anxiety , look at it from the perspective of a mental game against a very clever opponent . It 'S a mental game against a very clever opponent and you win this game by freeing yourself from health anxiety . But"
No," disorders ? No , how long have you had health anxiety for probably been about ah 7 or 8 years ? I think it started about yeah , maybe nine years ago , nine years ago , nine years ago , okay , so over nine years on a daily basis or not daily , but in a regular basis . Well , I after lie"
Environment," it again at your leisure through the adaa website . And we will check in to see if there 's some way of making the actual slides available , but definitely you 'll be able to go through this webinar again at your leisure yeah . What fell wonderful , to be able to"
No," pause and read over again yeah ? Absolutely now , one of the things that I talk to my patients about is to really really take this idea of playing a mental game and and put it into practice . We do that by externalizing anxiety and"
No," personifying it . So we take the struggle out of you and then we personify anxiety . We give it a face and a form and now we 're saying : okay , I 'm playing a mental game against that guy right . So if I create some sort of a creature and say okay , that 's gon na"
No," be my anxiety or anxiety monster or my opponent . However , you want to call them and he 's the one who 's going to be telling me all these things . We can mean so much easier to look at your problem when you 're doing it in that way . So , rather than I 'm having a headache , what"
No," very busy what if she missed something or made a mistake , WebMD says you might have . Ms , you have all the symptoms right , so he 's your anxiety disorder . Your opponent is basically dismissing the fact that your doctor spent the last ."
No," devaluing your doctor . Why do you ? Why do your hands all these tingling shake ? Is it ALS hold out your hands and see if they shake right ? So he 's telling you what to do right and if you do it , you 're making him stronger , no you 're feeding your anxiety by"
No," you want to get that comfort . You want to get that good reading , but in actuality , you 're , just making the anxiety worse , ask your wife what she thinks . Now you got to ask your wife : what do you think you think I have a problem and then it can cause marital trouble when , as your"
No," stomach still hurt , but if you have a stomachache , cancel your plans with your friends just rest and see what it see . If it goes away again he 's trying to get you not to do life , want you to focus on your stomach , stay home , focus on your stomach . I 'M go out with your friends"
No," right . The goal of your anxiety is to make sure that you 're miserable . So let 's talk about what your strategy needs to be , these are the . What I 'm going to put up now are the things that you have to implement and these things are like everything else easier said than done"
No," , but this is what your strategy needs to be and we 'll go into them more specifically , but here they are so . The first is , you have to refuse to believe your opponent 's lies . You have health anxiety , let this be your default . You already know you have how things I , or at"
No," least you should know you have things that should be your default . Remember you have . That , too , does n't mean you ca n't have medical issues , but do n't devalue or minimize the health anxiety that you have live without absolute certainty , be certain enough to be free from anxiety ."
No," gon na trust that he knows what he 's doing I 'm certain enough . You ca n't be a hundred percent , sir . If you demand a hundred percent certainty , you have to have health anxiety , so you have a choice . You can have health anxiety or you can be certain enough . The only way to be"
No," free from anxiety is to be uncertain . Do not fall for his tricks to engage . You , in a conversation , do n't answer . The question responds rudely we 're going to talk about how to respond . When you have an anxious thought , but anxiety is trying to bait you into a conversation . If he can"
No," pain and then suddenly for the next half hour , you 're focusing on the pain ? Do the opposite of what your opponent tells you to do super difficult , very hard and yet critical to overcome overcoming this disorder ? In fact , last focus on living your life and not on"
No," said in the beginning that these are all easier said than done and they are - and I think that 's one of the hardest parts about how things ID or any sort of anxiety for that matter is that yeah . These are all really great , because you 're great strategies they 're really"
No," really hard , but at the same time they really work like if you can really practice one and have the goal in mind of living . Your life they 're really helpful yeah , but it 's easy to fall into the tricks . You know , and I do think that that I do think of my haunting value"
No," something suffered from myself . I do think of it as oh there 's , my health anxiety again . Oh there 's the story that that I 'm having a heart attack again . There 'S that story , you know really separating it out is helpful . So , except what you know for sure , and let this be"
No," amount of time and probably I 've listeners probably suffering for longer it 's . This is a real disorder . Remember you have that . Don'T minimize the psychiatric component to this and to be free from anxiety , you must be uncertain . You know so , whether it 's a plane or"
No," with your thoughts and your behaviors . The more you do it , the more you focus on it , the more the anxiety gets worse , which is why you have to stop doing those behaviors . Do the opposite of what anxiety tells you to do and not engage with those questions ? There is obsessions"
No," of the first things you said that was helpful was doing the opposite . Stephanie of what your anxiety told you, which was huge, you can't stop those health worries unless you stop your behaviors first. So what are those behaviors stop? Reading"
No," WebMD, stop scanning your body for symptoms, stop checking your pulse and the other symptoms. Stop asking loved ones for reassurance, stop going to the doctor unless there's really a problem and that can be kind of tricky, stop avoiding triggers go to the doctor. If"
Environment," you avoid going to the doctor exercise and eat healthy for the right reasons right, so you have to change your behavior. If you want to change the way, you think so, this is a good slide for people to come back to when they're, watching the recording that list of"
No," behaviors to change to really start implementing this new strategy to start overcoming the health anxiety, exactly wonderful slide. So your behaviors are exacerbating your health and anxiety and making it worse. Not too long ago I was driving a bird turd landed on my"
No," give you some examples here: our responses for worrisome thoughts. So if your anxiety, your opponent, says to you what, if you really do, have cancer there's lots of different ways you could respond to that? I'M not answering the question."
No," know there's a lots of things, but what you don't want to do is engage with the thought you have to have a quick response. That anxiety doesn't expect and then move on so like Stephanie, when you would have an anxious thought. How would you respond to"
No," give me a heart attack. I dare you thanks for this opportunity to rewire my brain. These are just wonderful examples. Kent of different ways of responding yeah , I had a patient . He had a fear of having a heart attack . He I mean in a year he probably went to the ER like 10 to 20"
No," I , dare you kill me right now and then nothing would happen and he would feel in power right you 're , standing up to anxiety standing up to it . So the the physical symptoms are true , you 're , actually having those physical symptoms , the the thoughts are lies and"
No," diction yeah . So how do you get better at handling physical symptoms and anxious thoughts with practice ? What kind of practice well , if someone plays baseball and they 're really good at fielding , but they 're , not so good at batting ? What do you think they need to practice batting"
No," right ? They have to get up to the plate , they have to tell their a pitcher all right . Throw me balls , throw me a curveball , throw me a fastball . I need practice . So that 's what you 're going to be doing with your opponent . Look at your physical symptoms and worrisome thoughts"
No," of the night or something it would wake me up . You know whether it was chest pains or whatever it was , and you know what it wanted me to do . Is it wanted me to sit up straight and and go to the computer , call nineoneone or wake up somebody or do something ? That 'S exactly"
No," bring in some questions , so we have a little bit of time for people to type in some question . Let me just do this one last thing : the strategy that we 're talking about is to get you through the anxiety not to stop it . It will eventually stop , but that"
No," you know Stephanie , I 'm curious for you , the improvement that you made like like . Where are you at now in terms of your you know , health anxiety , and is it still getting you sometimes or how and also how long did the treatment take ? Well , I think it 's , I think it 's important to"
No," be more a little bit more vulnerable , but it 's just keep putting things into practice . I think you were to say on a scale of one to ten before you started treatment , ten being the worst , how bad was your health anxiety and what it is now , if you put you could put numbers on"
No," it . What would you say yeah there was a time that it was pretty high . I was up in the 8 to 10 range on any given day . I definitely was dying and now I 'd say you know like today . I do n't have any health anxiety , not that I do n't not , that my back does n't hurt or things do n't hurt"
No," already : here 's a really great one , Rick we 'll go over a little bit , just give a chance to have a few questions . Here 'S a mother of a young adult who has health , anxiety and she 's asking hey . Where do I draw the line between being supportive of my adult child and enabling and maybe"
No," reinforcing the health anxiety which I do n't want to do , but I want to be supportive right . That 'S a great question , so you enable the most common things loved ones do to enable is provide reassurance . So you know when the loved one calls up and says what do you think"
No," about this ? What do you think about that ? I wish to be the person with health anxiety . You know reaches out that you say no , I think you 're , okay , you 're , fine , you 're , okay , you know it never seems to be enough . I mean there 's you 're just constantly reassuring , and so probably a"
No," better response might be . Something like it sounds like your health anxiety is really getting the best of you or it sounds like you 're . Helping xiety is really high right now , so now you 're refocusing them on that . It 'S health anxiety , you 're reframing , it that 's"
No," helping xiety instead of providing reassurance . So it 's sabor de it 's not attempting to take away the distress right right . Okay , oh here 's , a question : if I have a choice between doing a cognitive , behavioral therapy CBT for my health , anxiety or"
No," I 'm really focusing on , even though it 's an actual condition . I have a lot of anxiety about it . How could the CBT help me with something like this ? Even though I 'm getting the treatment , I need for the medical condition and unfortunate that it was caught early , but how do I deal"
No," with the anxiety about yeah ? First , I 'm so sorry you you have this , you know as anxiety suffers . We are not immune , obviously from getting something medical , so that could happen right and just by you saying this , who knows there might be other people listening who might feel"
No," thing is that I had kind of a break in it now that I remember because now , I 'm remembering when I first saw someone for CBT back 20 years ago , and it was for now , I was having heart attacks all the time and it was very CBT And it was the first time in therapy that it changed"
Environment," everything I still I still remember my therapist name like so I probably was in therapy at that time , for you know six months that we were working together , weekly and really practicing CBT exercises every day and That carried me for a long time and I think that therapy"
No," it 's I think it 's just going in and learning the tools . So it 's not let you have to be . I do n't expect to have to be in therapy for the rest of my life for this . I know how to do it now . Sometimes , I might need support , but I mean I know how to do that ."
No," about exposure , so if I want to start working on my health anxiety issue , what is an exposure and how do I start doing that , and can I do that on my own young fellow thoughts on that , so we did not finish this webinar . So we 'll plan on doing a part two , so we did n't get to the"
No," exposure section so we 'll get to it next time . But to answer your question briefly yeah you can certainly do exposures , for instance , I 'll give you an example of a few of them , but it really depends on what you were , what your fears are so for people who do n't know exposures are"
No," facing your fears . So if someone has a fear of elevators , they actually have to get in the elevator . So you know you have a fear of cancer . It 'S not like you 're going to get cancer , but you might expose yourself to cancer related stories . You know so you might read about someone who"
No," just going out and doing it , because you can kind of do it wrong . You want to do it slowly and there 's a certain mindset and then maybe we could give us some examples , and that could be a part . One more quick question . Any books that you recommend for health , anxiety or websites"
No," can well , of course , the anxiety , depression Association of America . You go on , hey , hey , I wonder . If there are books on our website , I know there 's a book , there 's selfhelp books section . I do n't know if there are any selfhelp books specifically about health anxiety on the"
No," Hi everyone. I'm Emma McAdam, a licensed therapist, and today you're going to learn a stepbystep way to deal with anxiety. Anxiety can be really uncomfortable. It can mess with your life. And our natural tendency is to avoid stuff that makes us anxious, but that can make your life worse. So things like procrastinating assignments, being afraid to leave the house, avoiding social activities, or keeping yourself distracted all the time so that you don't have to notice your anxious thoughts. I mean, you get the idea, right? Anxiety messes your life up. But here's the thing:"
No," you don't just have to cope with anxiety; you can learn to process through anxiety to resolve it and change your relationship to it. So let me show you how. In this video we're going to use three examples to show you a stepbystep way to process anxiety. We're going to talk about Bob, who has social anxiety. He feels uncomfortable around people, and he constantly worries about what he says and what other people are thinking about him. We're going to talk about Jane, who experiences general anxiety. She just feels jittery and anxious much of the day for no apparent reason. And we're going to talk about Fred, who has event anxiety. So Fred's really anxious about"
No," an upcoming presentation that he has to give at school, and it's a big part of his grade and he really needs to get a good score. So throughout this video we're going to use these three examples as a way to actually put into practice the emotion processing model. These are the indepth skills that help you resolve anxiety instead of just cope with it. And if you want a free download teaching the five steps of how to process emotions, just check out the link in the description. So the very first step of dealing with anxiety is to observe it. There's a couple ways we can observe our emotions, a couple of skills that you can practice"
No," to get better at this. So you can start by asking yourself, ""What am I feeling right now? What are my thoughts saying right now? What sensations am I feeling in my body?"" A lot of times with my clients I'll ask them, you know, ""Where are you feeling this anxiety? What does it feel like?"" and they'll say things like, ""Cold hands"" or ""A tight stomach"" or ""Tense shoulders."" Right? And I'm going to encourage you to just notice it. Give a little bit of attention to what's going on as you feel anxiety because your natural tendency is to immediately avoid or suppress these feelings, and Freud said, ""Feelings buried alive never die."" So trying not to feel anxious is probably going to"
No," make you more anxious. It's like stuffing anxiety rocks into a backpack and carrying them around instead of looking at them and being like, ""I don't need this"" and setting it to the side. Okay. So for example, with general anxiety, Jane could observe her sensations like this: she could say something like, ""Oh, hmm. I feel jittery and anxious and I don't know why"" or ""I feel butterflies in my stomach. I feel tight in my chest."" Now, at first when we pay attention to these sensations it may make them a little louder or a little more uncomfortable, but but try it. You may be surprised when we acknowledge our sensations, when we lean"
No," having thoughts. You're the person who's experiencing emotions. So this skill is all about giving yourself a little bit of space between yourself and your thoughts and feelings. It can also help to name your emotion, to be as specific as possible. So you could say, ""I feel anxious,"" but if you get more specific you might say, ""I feel apprehensive or excited or nervous or dread, scared, frightful, unsettled, worried, concerned, peeved, right? The more specific you get, the more power you have over your emotions. So with social anxiety, Bob can say, ""I feel nervous about going to the party"" or ""I feel scared that I won't know"
No," what to say."" It's important to follow up the word ""feel"" with an emotion word, not a thought word. So for example, saying, ""I feel like everyone will judge me"" that's a thought, not a feeling. I feel scared that everyone will judge me that's an emotion word. Now, you can work with thoughts too. Right? And we're going to talk a lot about that in the explore section. It's just, we can really benefit from getting really specific about which is which. Thoughts and emotions are two separate things. So going back to thoughts: if Bob works to notice his automatic thoughts, he could say, ""I worry that I won't know anyone there"" or ""I just don't want to go because"
No," I think everyone is looking at me."" When Fred works on the observing step, he might say, ""Oh, I've got to give that presentation next week, and I've got a pit in my stomach. I'm worried I won't sleep well. I'm worried that I'm going to do a bad job."" So he's just going to notice, like, ""What are my worries?"" Now, an important part of observing emotions is letting go of judgment. So instead of saying, ""This anxiety is awful. This anxiety is terrible. This is horrible,"" we're gonna describe the emotion instead. So instead of labeling it as good or bad, we're gonna say something like, ""Oh, this is uncomfortable. This is a little painful,"" and remind yourself that"
No," that you can download so that you can reference it and walk yourself through the steps when you need to. So just, I mean, check out the link below if you want that, that list. Okay, so that's the first step in emotion processing. That's observe. Okay. So the second step in processing emotions like anxiety is willingness. Willingness is the secret ingredient in emotion processing. If you want to work through emotions you need to choose to be willing to feel them, and this is a skill that you can develop. So when we feel an uncomfortable emotion like anxiety, most of us just have this instinctive reaction to avoid it, to escape it, to just run amok,"
No," to keep busy or keep distracted, and this keeps us stuck in a constant level of anxiety because you never face it. The lie anxiety tells us or the message it's actually trying to tell us is that you're in danger. But a lot of times that's not true because you're actually safe. And avoiding that anxiety keeps you stuck in that danger response, it keeps you stuck in anxiety. So when you take the time to sit with anxiety. to lean into it, you'll realize that the vast majority of time you are actually safe. And if there is some action you need to take to get safe or solve a problem, distraction or avoidance won't help you there either. So distraction and"
No," avoidance make you more anxious, and willingness is the opposite of that. So let's practice some willingness right now. I want you to slow yourself down just a little bit. Take a slow breath and get grounded in the present moment. That means, you know, feel your feet on the floor or the chair pressing into you. Pay attention to your bodily sensations, and let yourself sit with them for a moment without needing to make those feelings go away or distract yourself from them. Now, if in the moment of anxiety, if you're too upset to do this,"
Environment," then the other thing you can do to practice willingness is you can try exaggerating your emotions in your body. We're not trying to force ourselves to calm down; we're trying to allow ourselves to experience what we're feeling in the present moment. So if calming down wasn't helping, let's try leaning in. So if you're feeling jittery, let yourself shake. Exaggerate those shakes a little bit. Right? If you're feeling tense, tighten your muscles a little bit. Another way to practice willingness is to listen to some music that expresses how you feel. And another one of my favorite exercises is the braindump exercise. You just"
No," write down everything in your head, and you put on a piece of paper. Some other things you can try, I mean, if you can do it in a nonforceful way, is to just practice some more of those nervoussystem calming activities. And I've got videos on these on YouTube. Right? Slow breathing, the yawn, shake it out, or progressive muscle relaxation. Now, this is especially relevant with general anxiety. So general anxiety is often a buildup of tiny little bits of anxiety over time that aren't addressed or processed, and then you just feel anxious all the time but you don't know why. So with Jane, her inclination is to just keep avoiding her anxiety, and she does this by"
No," watching a lot of TikToks and spending a lot of time on Netflix. She tries not to think about it. She, if she's feeling anxious she'll eat something and and, you know, she'll just try any small, distracting things you can do to make it go away. But with general anxiety it actually helps a lot more to pause for a moment, to turn everything off, to close your eyes and say, oh, you know, go back to observing, ""What what am I feeling right now? Where is it in my body?"" Okay, let me give you another example of willingness with Fred. So Fred's worried about this upcoming presentation, but the more anxious he feels he's more likely to procrastinate,"
No," to avoid his studies, or to just run around trying to anxiously study and prepare to like an extreme degree. But if you're running amok, it doesn't let the thinking part of your brain turn on. So he needs to find a way to slow himself down and and choose to be willing to feel some anxiety around the situation. So first, I mean, he could just say, ""Hey, this stress response can help me prepare"" instead of judging it as like, ""This anxiety is so terrible. I can't handle it."" Like, ""Oh, you know, this stress response, it's gonna help me be motivated to work on my presentation. It's okay to feel a little bit of stress. It's okay to feel a"
No," little bit of excitement about this presentation."" Another thing Fred could try is just going on a walk without his phone. Like, this this lets his body move through some of those stress hormones and perhaps clear his mind a little bit. And and then he could sit down and do a brain dump, you know. If he were to write this down on paper he could say, ""Oh, I have a test tomorrow. I've studied this much. I still need to study this much. Here are the areas I feel confident in. Here are the areas I don't,"" etc. He just puts it all down on paper. So in this way he can face his anxiety, but from a more centered, intentional approach. Now, with social anxiety,"
No," the treatment's actually not very complicated, but it does require a lot of willingness. So willingness would look like Bob putting himself in a social situation and noticing that he's feeling anxious but not leaving. So basically, Bob has to change the rules in his head. The old rules said, you know, ""Don't go if it makes you feel uncomfortable,"" or ""This is terrible if you feel anxious when you're out."" And the new rules say, ""Oh, it's okay to have feelings and sensations. I can totally allow myself to go to this party and feel a little anxious"" and still go, you know. So he says something to himself like, ""Bring it on, anxiety. I can feel anxious, and I can still"
No," go to the party. I can handle feeling this way. It's okay to feel anxious. Let's do this."" Now, by choosing to be willing to feel, he does two things. So number one, he changes his relationship with anxiety. He drops that struggle to never feel anxious, and that actually is going to decrease his anxiety over time. And then the second thing he does is he actually shows up at the party, which gives him a chance to be around people. This gives his brain a chance to learn that it's safe, and it's actually going to decrease his anxiety over time. Okay. That takes us to our next step, which is number three: explore. Exploring your anxiety is all about making it clear and concrete."
No," So anxiety is like a smoke alarm. It's a loud, uncomfortable signal that indicates you might be in danger. But 99% of the time your smoke alarm goes off because you were cooking bacon or you just took a long, hot shower. So when your smoke alarm goes off in your house, you don't normally bring in the fire hoses or, you know, immediately start hosing down your house. You first just check to see if there is an actual fire. If there is a fire, heck yes run from the house, call the fire department, turn on the hoses. But most of the time there isn't a fire; you're safe. You just made bacon. So you can press that mute button on your smoke alarm. Now,"
No," anxiety is like a smoke alarm. Sometimes we think the loud signal of anxiety is the problem, the anxiety is the actual dangerous thing. So we try to shut off the signal or get rid of anxiety altogether or cope with it or, you know, sell the house. Right? Like, throw our lives away to avoid anxiety. But anxiety isn't dangerous; it's just a signal asking us to clarify if we're safe or not. So with anxiety, we can really benefit from exploring it. And and that looks like really checking to see if your anxiety is helpful. Is your anxiety helping you be safer? So we clarify. We ask, ""Are you in physical danger right now? Or are you actually safe in this moment?"""
No," And then we try to make it as concrete as possible instead of vague. So we write about it. We talk about it. We make it concrete. We diagram it. Right? Another part of exploring is to explore our thoughts because our thoughts often convince us that we're in danger. So what thoughts might you be having that are making your anxiety worse? Are you catastrophizing? Are you thinking in black and white? Are you mental filtering? Are you only noticing the negative? So, exploring what's behind your anxiety can help you know if you should take action to get safe or just take steps to soothe your overactive alarm system. So let's use social anxiety here."
No," It's easy to explore social anxiety because it's often centered around a lot of fearful thoughts. So Bob thinks, ""Everyone will judge me, and their judgments will be negative for sure, and if they did it would be catastrophic."" Right? You can see how thinking this way in the most extreme way is going to make you really anxious. So in the exploring part of anxiety we have to question these thoughts. Is it likely that everyone will judge you? Is it realistic? Would you survive if they did? Right? The answer is most likely most people aren't judging you. Even if they did, you would probably be okay. Like, it's not gonna kill you if someone judges you. Okay. So this is"
No," where we also explore our unwritten rules. So with social anxiety you might not realize that you have an internal rule that goes something like, ""I have to be perfect or else I must withdraw from everyone."" Unwritten rules like this set you up for failure. Okay, so let's do another one. Let's talk about Jane and her general anxiety. So in the explore step of emotion processing, Jane can explore what's going on in her life that's adding up to this sense of anxiety. What what little things are you dealing with or not dealing with it? And she could write them down. Now, this is super important. Right? Don't just think about them; write them down. So when when"
Environment," Jane sits and writes them down, it sounds kind of like this: ""Bills, kids, work, friends, too much coffee and not enough sleep, too much sugar and not enough exercise, trying to do too many social events, trying to make everyone happy, never saying no,"" etc. etc. Right? So sometimes general anxiety is about life management. It's about taking on too many things and trying to do everything for everyone and then getting overwhelmed. So by writing these things down, you can see how you're spending your time, and you can see the things that are left unfinished. And and, you know, perhaps Jane would create a plan to start setting better boundaries. So I,"
No," like, I really mean, I think that if people with general anxiety just write it all down and then choose one thing to resolve or let go of or say no to, they're going to decrease their anxiety a ton. Now, you'll notice that this part of processing is a lot more complicated or detailed than the other steps, and this is often the area we spend the most amount of time in therapy on. We, you know, clarify and explore your options. We make them concrete, and we clear up faulty thinking. But these are things you can do on your own, and a lot of these skills are in my emotion processing course. Okay. Number four. Now that we have observed our emotions,"
No," we've felt them, we've explored them and what's behind them, now we're ready to clarify and choose what we're going to do about them. So the exploring work laid the foundation for us to clarify what we want to do about anxiety. Now, there's two essential skills here in this step: the locus of control activity and the values activity. So with the locus of control activity, you separate what is and what isn't in your realm of control. It's really simple, but it's a powerful way to clarify anxiety. So with performance anxiety, Fred he can't control whether he feels anxious, he can't control other people's reactions, he can't directly control the"
No," outcome of his grade, but he can control how much he prepares. He can research, he can practice, he can ask for feedback, he can choose to be willing to feel anxiety and call it excitement, and all of these indirectly influence the outcome, which is his grades. Okay. Step four is also where we get ready for action by using a values activity to clarify what's most important to you. So values activity helps you know where to put your energy and focus. So Bob could ask himself, ""Why do I care about people and friends even though parties are sometimes uncomfortable?"" Or he could ask, you know, ""Am I willing to engage in life"
No," even if it's uncomfortable?"" Basically he's asking himself, ""What's most important to me? Is it most important to me to be home alone or is it most important to me to go be with people?"" Jane could ask, you know, ""What are the most stressful parts of my life?"" and also ask, ""What are the things that are keeping me busy that aren't important?"" And, you know, by clarifying what she values, what she wants her life to be about, you know, perhaps she decides to say no to a couple of extra responsibilities at work so that she has extra time for her husband or kids. Or maybe she carves out some time for herself to practice selfcare and"
No," rest and relax. So by taking a bigpicture look, like, ""What do I want my life to be about? How do I want my life to be going?"" you can get a lot of clarity about what to keep and what to let go of. Okay. Fred, Fred could say, ""Oh, is it worth it for me to give that presentation even though it's hard?"" Or he could say, ""Oh, am I willing to spend less time with friends so that I can work hard on that presentation?"" Right? He values his grades, he values his friends. And values clarification is asking, you know, ""What do I really care about most in life? Do I care most about comfort or people? You know. Is avoiding things more important to me than facing them?"""
No," And basically that leads us into the last step of processing anxiety. So step five is act or accept. So we can spend all day thinking about anxiety. We can be willing to feel anxiety. We can explore it. We can clarify it. But if we don't choose to act, our lives are still probably going to stink. So here's where you, you get to choose to act or to accept. Now, with many situations we can find one small thing to change. So if that's the case, just plan some action that lines up with your values. I mean this could be something like, ""Oh, I'm going to get more sleep"" or ""I'm going to organize one area in my house"" or ""I'm gonna set one boundary."" But in some situations there's"
Environment," can handle having emotions. You can also practice. When you're in the acceptance part of this you can practice uh some bodycalming exercises. Okay. So what does this look like? So with social anxiety, Bob asks, you know, ""What do I really care about? Do I want to have friends? Do I want to be friendly? Am I healthy without them?"" So most people experience some social anxiety, and actually caring about people comes with worrying if you said something mean or something like that. Right? So are you willing to engage with life, with with friends even if it makes you uncomfortable? Are you willing to interact with people even if you're not perfect,"
No," even if maybe you don't say the right thing? Right? Can you engage with people on a real, vulnerable, human level? You know. I think deep down most people value this real connection, and making the choice to live your life, to love and to connect with others is more valuable than sitting home because you're afraid you'll mess up and be judged. If you value living life, you make it a small choice, like, ""Oh, I will go to the party this week"" or ""I will call up Amy and ask her if she wants to hang out,"" etc. Right? So this step is all about just choosing some small action that you're gonna take, and then take it. Okay. So let's look at the general anxiety example."
No," Okay. So Jane has been spending a lot of time trying to distract herself from her anxiety, but after exploring it Jane realizes, you know, ""I'm stressed out because my room is a mess and I can't pay my bills."" So she says, ""I'm gonna clean my room, and then I'm going to ask my brother about how to budget."" These are actual problems that need actual action. Right? Don't just cope with the anxiety; resolve the problem, and the anxiety around it will go away. With most situations we benefit from combining action with acceptance. So with performance anxiety, Fred can't make the anxiety go away, and it often makes it worse to try to not feel anxious."
No," So even I, like sometimes I get really shaky when I do public speaking, and if I try to force myself to calm down it usually makes me feel more anxious. So instead I say something like, ""Oh, you know what, it's worth it for me to try to help others, so I'm willing to accept that it also comes with some anxiety."" And and this just means that I care. So I make space for those emotions and sensations, and I'm going to choose to feel my feelings and act on my values, and I'm going to make the video anyway, or I'm going to do the presentation anyway. This is how you process anxiety. And just so you know, the vast majority of the time when we face"
No," our fears, when we keep showing up, we go to the party, we take the test, we give a presentation, then our brain learns, ""You survived. That wasn't actually dangerous."" And most of the time your brain actually decreases your anxiety over time when you face your fears. But even if it doesn't, Fred, Jane, and Bob, and you, you're still living the life that you value. So even if it's uncomfortable, Bob still sees friends, Fred still does the presentation, and Jane cleans her room. And because they're living their values, their lives are rich and meaningful. You really can learn to process through anxiety, and when you do, a lot of it will resolve. That"
Environment," smoke alarm won't keep blaring all the time. But having anxiety can motivate you to solve problems, create safety, and take action. So experiencing some anxiety is about caring about life, and because of that I hope that never goes away completely. Okay. I hope you found this video helpful. If you want to learn more of the indepth skills to process emotions and get the workbook with exercises, check out my course How to Process Your Emotions. The link is in the description. Thank you for watching, and take care."
No," This program is a presentation of UCTV for educational and noncommercial use only. Marty is a delight to have here and a delight to introduce, especially to a room full of people who is interested in learning about mindbody medicine. Marty Rossman has"
No," with many different techniques to help calm us down to help us get to a point of relaxation. Using hypnosis, health hypnosis, biofeedback, body work, but especially guided imagery. He is a member of the advisory board for the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine,, and I was interested to discover he's also a member"
No," and some people worry all the time. And if you're one of those people who finds themselves worried all the time, I think that you might get something very useful. I hope that you get something very useful out of tonight's talk. If you just worry intermittently,"
No," I hope you get something useful anyhow, but you don't probably don't need it quite as much. So I'm calling my topic tonight Worrying Well, and I'm still looking for a subtitle, but tonight we'll call it how to use your brain to relieve anxiety and stress and turn it into more desirable things"
No," that wasn't made by God or nature, take your pick, or some combination of the two. Everything else that exists, everything that human kind has created started in somebody's imagination. That's where it made its first appearance on Earth, as somebody's imagination."
Environment," that the human imagination is the most powerful force on Earth. And the thing is, very few of us have ever really been taught how to use it. Most of our education, especially all the way through to higher education, is on using other mental faculties,"
No," which also have made us very powerful. The ability to analyze. The ability to calculate. Linear, logical, rational, scientific ways of thinking have also contributed to us being very powerful because they allow us to take the things that we imagine and make them real"
No," And we often use them interchangeably. I'm gonna spend a little time to differentiate these things a little bit, but they do overlap quite a bit. And then anxiety also overlaps with worry and stress. They're all a little bit different, and they're very interrelated."
No," So I like this Ashleigh Brilliant quote. ""Due to circumstances beyond my control, ""I am master of my fate and captain of my soul."" So you're it. If you wanna do something about your anxiety, your stress, the way that you think, the way that you create your life. You are the captain whether you like it or not."
No," So we might as well learn how to use these capacities 'cause there's really no going back. I think sometimes unconsciously we try to go back with other ways of managing anxiety and stress like drinking too much or taking drugs, medications, or eating too much. All the millions of ways we have of going unconscious"
No," and kind of trying to just put our head in the sand and maybe it'll go away, which it frequently does. So it's not that it's not a good strategy in the short run, but as a total life plan, it's kind of lacking, okay? It won't take you where you want to go. So how are worry, stress, and anxiety different? So worry is a type of, this is how I think about it,"
No," and I can be argued with. I'm not sure that any of this is actually true. I'm kind of throwing it out there. I'm writing a book on it. So if I'm wrong, please tell me before the book is written. But it seems to me that worry is a type of thinking, okay? And our friend here Ziggy says,"
No, the most common unconscious use of the imagination is to drive ourselves crazy or worry ourselves sick. So the bar is set pretty low. That's the good news. We can learn to use it more on purpose and do better than that. So worry is a type of thinking.
No," It's a repetitive kind of thinking. Sometimes a rumination, it's generally troubled. It often has to do with things that are either in the past or in the future, okay? It's the opposite of be here now. It's the opposite of present center. That doesn't mean it's bad,"
No," and that doesn't meant that it doesn't have a function. But we're in our brain, we're thinking about something. We're going over and over it. And again, I think that's because the adaptive function of worry, I always assume that something is there is an attempt by nature or by life to solve a problem"
No," And finally, one of their neighbors can't take it anymore. He goes over and he says, ""I hope you don't mind if I ask you ""why you walk around your house all the day, every day."" And she says, ""Well, I'm keeping it safe from tigers."" And he says, ""Well, we're in Indiana. ""There aren't any tigers here."""
No," So, and we know that that's a function. That's actually been studied. So that worry prevents deeper, richer, more emotionalladen thinking, which typically comes in images and comes in the quiet times. So if there's a lot of feeling there that's hard to process"
No," and that gives us choices in terms of what we're doing with the rest, okay? So worry's a thinking function, whereas anxiety, anxiety is an uncomfortable feeling. It's usually in the chest or the upper abdomen. Not always, but it's most often up in this area or this area."
No," It's an uncomfortable feeling of fear or apprehension or dread. Dread is, it's that feeling, ""Oh my God, something bad is going to happen, I know it. ""Something bad is going to happen."" You don't know. It may be attached to something"
No," or it may be freefloating and not attached to anything. And anxiety often comes with physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, pain in the chest, sweating, shortness of breath. There's often a feeling with anxiety if anxiety is very strong, like panic attacks. There's often a very characteristic feeling"
No," maybe the primary function of a primary care doctor is seeing if there's anything else but anxiety going on, because anxiety can cause so many symptoms in so many systems of the body and make us afraid. A sense that something bad is gonna happen. Anxiety is a function of a part of the brain that is the emotional part of the brain."
No," It's called a limbic system or the emotional brain, so worry belongs to the thinking part of the brain. And there's a lot of interaction, but worry belongs in the thinking part of the brain, the cortex. Anxiety typically comes from the limbic or emotional part of the brain,"
No," thinking about aging, thinking about whether you can meet your responsibilities. All kinds of stuff, and all kinds of stuff that is, that unless you know where the off button is on your television or your radio or your computer, that you can just literally pump into your brain 24/7 if you stay up."
No," All the bad news of every bad thing that has happened around the world to anybody, or if it's a slow news day, what could happen, okay? Like the H1N1 flu, 'cause it's not a terribly, doesn't look like a terribly dangerous flu right now, but it could become really dangerous. And that's what's got everybody scared"
No," And of course, the really good worriers are not only doing it during the daytime. You're up at night, too, because you can't sleep, right? And so it's taking your, and that takes your resilience away, and it becomes a real negative, vicious cycle. So, to review."
No," Worry is a type of repetitive, circular thinking. Anxiety is an uncomfortable feeling of fear or dread. Stress is a physical response that prepares you to meet challenges and so it's interesting to look at. This is sort of a somewhat dated model of the brain. It's called the Triune Brain,"
No," And then as animals developed, the limbic system pretty much developed in mammals, and other, in warm, furry creatures, who characteristically have social relationships. And for mammals, for most mammals, not all mammals, social relationships like prides of lions and packs of wolves and families of people"
No," and things like that have adaptive value. We do better when we're connected to groups. We have more strength. We have more problemsolving ability. We have emotional support. We are social creatures, and our social positions mean a lot to us."
No," is that the new guy is very entranced with himself, okay? The thinking brain thinks that nothing was important before he came along. And I saw he kind of deliberately. It could be she too, but it's a kind of, it's not that there aren't tremendously bright and intellectual women,"
No," but it's kind of thinking analysis, logic, that kind of thinking on a yinyang scale we typically characterize as a kind of a masculine thinking. Not that it doesn't belong to women too. Whereas the feeling, the intuitive, tends to be a more kind of receptive, softer. It has its own logic, but it's not the same"
No," which is called the dominant hemisphere. Speech capability, mathematical capability and so on. Whereas in the right side of the brain in the same area, lie areas of the brain that have to do with the body image, with emotional recognition and facial expressions, and tone of voice, and those kinds of skills. So they each have their place."
Environment, and with other living things and with our environment. And I think that a lot of the crisis we're seeing is we're trying to come back to that and own those relationships while still maintaining our ability to be technically creative and help solve those problems that way. I think that these have been around a lot longer.
Environment," ""and you're the subdominant hemisphere. ""I'm the major hemisphere, you're the minor hemisphere."" And it's kind of a joke, but I think it's also true, and we have valued that. Think about your education. How many hours of emotional education did you get? How many hours of education"
Environment," in using your imagination did you get? Or your intuition? So your education, and I'm not saying that it was, hopefully, at least when I went to school, it was reading, writing, arithmetic. It was those left brain, analytic, logical skills. Tremendously useful, but not all of us."
Environment," And this other kind of intelligence, I think we need a lot more education experience with it. Learn how to communicate with it, and that's why in a little while I'm gonna talk about imagery, which is its coding language in a sense of this more emotional and intuitive brain. So here's a kind of a picture"
No," Like for this guy. So this guy's having a, he's not having a good day. He's having a rage reaction, and without going through all of these things, just if you want to study this, you can, but something didn't match up with his expectations, okay? That's where most anger comes from."
No," there's a real wiring diagram and a real chemical messaging system. So anxiety, stress, and worry are interactive, they're bidirectional. If you have a tendency to be anxious, that emotional brain is gonna be pumping out more messages of, ""Look out."""
No," and it's gonna send messages back and they can get into a real, kind of a reverberating circuit. All these parts of the brain are chemically sensitive, and of course in medicine, typically we try to chemically manipulate these things if somebody's got a real anxiety disorder."
No, We're not talking about anxiety disorders which where the anxiety level is just cranked up high in spite of the thinking here. But we try to manipulate that with medications. Those of us who have studied nutritional medicine know that there are naturally occurring molecules. That there are molecules in our foods
No," that underlie our reactions, so. And that's gonna be our focus tonight, is about thinking. For any of you who have any doubts that the mind and body are really connected and create physiology, just a real quick, this is biofeedback data. And to make it simple, this is muscle tension. This is electrical response in the skin."
No," This is fingertip temperature, which is a sign of either stress or relaxation. This nice, even white line here is respiration. So this guy is sitting in a biofeedback therapist's office with a bunch of sensors hooked up to his muscles and his fingertips to measure the way that his circulation responds to stress."
No," You can see it best here, what happens to his breathing. It just goes to pod. It's just very shallow, very irregular. Stops breathing into his abdomen. His skin temperature, actually this reversed. It should go decrease. His muscle tension goes up."
No," ""Just think about coming down the stairs ""and seeing your car keys."" In a person who's developed a phobia, that would be enough to stimulate a huge reaction. Now, if the person then can learn to breathe more deeply and to induce a relaxation response, which most people can, while he's imagining that, go back to the calm physiology."
No," and how much we respond to just thinking about things. So there's a lot, how many have heard the term neuroplasticity? Has that been talked about here? So it doesn't mean your brain is made of plastic. It means that your brain is changeable, and there's been a lot of literature lately"
No," And what happens over time, what they found was, in these people, that watching a device called a functional MRI, which can show us what parts of the brain are active while people are thinking, that it was the part of the brain in the occipital cortex that processes visual information,"
Environment," Isn't that astounding? So part of Jeffrey Schwartz at UCLA, his research has been with people with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder, which has been traditionally a very difficult condition to treat, and finding very structured, repetitive exercises,"
No," at the table like this and looks like a cretin and spends all of his time in his room and is barely human, and he was a brilliant, loving little kid. He's got testosterone poisoning, which is again, seriously, (audience laughing) is again, killing neurons in his brain that have to do with emotional communication."
No," in thinking about how we think. Thinking about how we worry. That if the blind can learn to see, then the anxious should be able to learn to relax. I would think it's much easier to learn to relax than it is to see when you've never seen before. I may be wrong, but this is kind of at the center of it."
No," If our brain is capable of that kind of learning, then what do we need to do in order to teach it? And this is a great term that comes from Jeffrey Schwartz selfdirected neuroplasticity, which is fascinating because you're using your own mind to change your own brain. Really an interesting concept."
No," is ""How to Avoid Natural Selection,"" which is (mumbles). So this is ultimately, I mean, our greatest selfcare tool. So let's talk about how we can think about this, and this is how I'm thinking about it now. I'm thinking that there's good worry and bad worry. And by that, I mean good worry is functional worry."
Environment," ""I'm worried about this project. ""I'm worried about where to go to school. ""I'm worried about whether I'm gonna be able ""to pay for my kid's education."" Real stuff to worry about. It's not that there's any lack of real stuff to worry about, but stuff that, if you asked yourself, ""Is it likely"
No," Doesn't go anywhere. Doesn't lead to solutions, scares you. In a sense, it starts to become a type of autosuggestion, right? 'Cause you're thinking about this thing all the time, you're scaring yourself. You're sending out those fear pathway and that makes"
No," So there's ways, ordinary ways to access more wisdom. Talk to people that you think are wise. If you have wise friends, if you have wise teachers, see if they'll talk to you and you can share your problem, listen to 'em, consider what they say. That's one good source of wisdom. This stands for what would"
No," Jesus, Buddha, Dalai Lama, or Yoda do? So if you don't have access to a wise friend or teacher, this is a type of imagery technique. Think about what would somebody that you imagine is genuinely wise, what would they say in that situation? Remember Hillary Clinton got all kinds"
No," ""that has this wisdom."" Because there is a part of all of us that has a lot of wisdom. You know when it comes out? It comes out when your friend's in trouble. When your friend comes to you for advice 'cause they can't figure it out, right?"
No," And have you ever noticed how easy it is to give advice to your friends? Good advice, usually. And if it's a serious thing, you take time to think about it. You don't just give them a glib answer. You take some time and you think about it."
No," You go down as deep as you can inside yourself and you give them that wise advice. The thing is, it's probably easier for you to get to your wisdom than your friend if your friend is really frightened. Because when we are frightened, when we're anxious, when we're worried,"
No," and that blocks our access to our own wisdom. And that's why taking the time to go to actually do a relaxation practice, relax your body, shift your mind, imagine that you go to a place that's beautiful and peaceful and safe, so that you get out of that fearful loop."
No," You imagine, or you invite an image, of someone or something that's wise and loving, and that cares about you, whether it's someone or something you've ever met or something you just make up. You just imagine, you imagine what it would tell you or show you or do with you, and it's quite remarkable what can come"
No," from a meditation like this. Does that make sense to people? And so it's easier to do that for your friend because as much as you love your friend, you're probably not gonna be as freaked out as they are if it's a serious situation. We see this all the time."
No," and figure out their best option. While emotionally, they're feeling like a threeyearold. So, and it's very difficult for them to make the decisions that way. These kinds of techniques, if you start early and help them connect to a deeper level enough that scared child can really make a difference"
No," in terms of wise decisionmaking. So sometimes they give, your inner advisor will say something like this. ""The secret of living without frustration and worry ""is to avoid becoming personally involved in your own life."" This is definitely a good treatment for worry, okay? But usually, and that's not bad advice."
No," Here's how I think this thing kind of works. So if we go through this process of thinking about the worries, I actually have people in class write them down and then go through and separate them. I mean, it sounds mechanical. It's just using our ordinary intelligence."
No," So, and I'm gonna skip the whole argument here about whether or not that has a physical effect and the secret. Whether we just make something happen by changing our intention, and sometimes it seems that we do and sometimes we don't. But what does happen when people, in other words, some friend gets diagnosed with cancer"
No," and you are overcome with worry because you are just worried that she's gonna die, okay. Or be sick or go through some horrendous thing 'cause you care for your friend. That's a typically normal reaction. But you find yourself losing sleep and you're thinking about"
No," But now you start to say, ""Okay, instead of constantly imagining ""what I don't wanna have happen, ""I'm gonna think about what I would rather have happen, ""so I'm gonna start to imagine that she gets great treatment ""and that her cancer responds ""and that she comes through that treatment"
No," ""and she survives it and she comes out being ""an even stronger and healthier person. ""That if it's up to, if it was up to me, ""if I was God, that's what would happen."" And I don't know if that'll make any difference, but that's where I'm gonna put my energy, instead of putting my energy over here."
No," And whether it changes the outcome or not, way beyond me, but what it does do is that when people start focusing on that image, they become less anxious. You become less anxious because you feel like, ""I'm doing what I can be doing ""and I'm putting my energy into what I wanna see happen."""
No," Does that make sense? Without doing that, I was talking to a psychiatrist friend of mine the other day about this and he says, ""I think you're talking about intention deficit disorder."" 'Cause a lot of this comes down to whether how much control we can have about where we put our attention. So we put our attention in this case on a,"
No," if you're a prayer, if you're a religious person and you have a way of praying, then you pray for the outcome that you desire. If you're not a religious person, if you don't pray, you visualize or you intend it. You say, ""If it's up to me, ""I'm worried that my friend will succumb."
No," ""I don't want that to happen."" ""But the way that I'm gonna put my energy ""into her getting better, ""into imagining that she gets better."" And if nothing else, it'll help you. It'll help reduce your anxiety level. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot."
No," so that you can be more effective in making changes that you want to, okay. And leading to an action that can actually resolve these problems. So imagery is a type of thinking, people often say that it involves your senses. Thoughts that you can see, hear, smell, feel, daydreams."
Environment," And it's just that we haven't had much education in using it, and runaway imagination is probably the primary source of modern stress. It's not just what's happening, it's what you think will happen to you, and how it will affect you"
No," You could work up pretty good anxiety. If I asked you instead to imagine that you go to a place that's peaceful and beautiful to you and that you just loved to be in, we have nothing to do and it's safe and it's the right temperature and notice what you see and hear and smell"
No," Let's do, would you like to do some imagery? Some guided imagery instead. We'll rest your left brain. We'll fan it off, cool it off. So I wanna share with you a fairly simple imagery that we call evocative imagery. How many of you have used guided imagery on purpose before?"
No," And give it a name. Think about what the name of it, and you could do a couple of qualities. I wouldn't do more than, sometimes it's unclear what you need more of. I feel like I need more, I don't know if it's courage or I need more strength,"
No," as you welcome the breath into your body. Just notice that you're literally bringing fresh energy and oxygen into your body. You can invite it to circulate and flow around your body in the bloodstream to every cell of your body. Brings fresh energy. And as you let the breath out, if you like,"
No," just let it be an invitation to your body, your mind, even your spirit, to just let go of any tension or discomfort you don't have to hold right now. And you don't even have to worry about whether you need to hold or what you can let go of. Just invite the body to soften."
No," and let yourself get comfortable there. And then think about a quality that you think you'd like to feel more of. The name of a quality, a particular quality or feeling state that you'd like to feel more of. And then let yourself go back in your memory to some time when you experienced yourself"
No," having that quality in yourself. Just let your memory go back to some time when you felt that quality in yourself. And some of you may not have a memory of having that quality, so let yourself go to some time when you witnessed somebody else expressing that quality or embodying that quality."
No, In your chest. Especially in your brain. Your spinal cord and your nervous system. As if every cell of your body were touched by a ray of this quality. As if you were a sponge and you were bathing in this quality and could soak up as much as you'd like.
No, And just let yourself rest in that for a few more minutes. And just take a moment before you bring your awareness back into the room. Just take a moment to review what's happened in this brief imagery experience. What quality you were looking to experience more of. Whether you have or not.
No," Did everybody hear that? It sometimes you get into such a stressful state and an anxious state, it's just. She's had experiences where relaxation, guided imagery have been very useful. And other times when she's been so stressed and so anxious and upset that she couldn't even get into it,"
No," Talk to a friend. This is a place where medications may come in. I find a double shot of Jack Daniels works really well. I wouldn't recommend it as a daily diet, but it certainly helps really get your anxiety level down, and you may be able then to relieve enough of the anxiety that you can pay attention to these things."
No," So there are many other things we can do, from medications to nutrients to other relaxants to doing whatever you need to get to that place, where you can focus. One of the qualities of imagery thinking is that it can help you connect with the bigger picture and how things are connected in kind of a bigger picture,"
No," Because that's part of really sorting it into things that you might be able to do, something about things you can't do something about, is to let yourself run it out. Does that make sense to you? Yeah? So sometimes when people are making treatment choices"
No," that are very difficult, I'll invite them to imagine that they're at a crossroads. Again, this happens when, and if they go down this road, they choose this kind of treatment, and just imagine walking down that road and just imagine it going as far as you can and see what you imagine go down this road"
No," We have trouble sleeping. The body starts to signal that it needs something. So finding a way to get to those deeper levels and plug in a couple of those relaxation places as just a basic tool is I think one of the real fundamental benefits of guided imagery, which is a type of meditation at that level."
No, And I really appreciate your attention. Thank you very much. I hope it was useful. (audience clapping) (upbeat music)
No," Gosh, it is hard to not worry about your health and the health of others, especially during this pandemic and when dramatic, healthfocused news is everywhere. Now, I have never worried much about my health, but that's all changed since the pandemic hit. So back in March of 2020, we went to a super rural part of Utah. We hiked around and we explored. We thought we were being careful with social distancing. And then on our way back home, we stopped for ice cream to appease our children, but we had to order inside. And afterwards I remember being just hit with like fear and worry. And I started worrying, you know,"
No," really catastrophizing. I told my husband, ""Oh, no. I'm sure that we're gonna get COVID from that,"" even though there were only a handful of cases in Utah at the time. And I decided not to go see my parents that Easter weekend because I feared exposing them. Now, I think it's really normal to worry about your health sometimes, and it's especially normal to worry about it during a global pandemic. Everyone worries about their health sometimes. However, health anxiety can be a quite serious problem when it gets more entrenched. Health anxiety is an obsessive and irrational worry about having a serious medical condition. It's also called illness anxiety,"
No," and it used to be called hypochondria. With health anxiety, you believe that you have an illness that you don't actually have. Another form of health anxiety is somatization disorder, where you interpret small bodily sensations as being a symptom of something serious. But health anxiety is real paradox. There are some things that a lot of people try to soothe their anxiety that actually feeds their anxiety, and this is called the health anxiety cycle. But there is an escape. It's just, you know, different than what you might think. So in this video, you'll learn five things you might do that make health anxiety worse, and you're gonna learn what to do instead."
No," The holidays are coming up, and you know what that means more time with your family. And for many of us that's exciting, but for others that means more stress, conflict, drama, and hurt feelings. So if you'd like to improve your relationships with family and friends but you don't know where to start, there are steps you can take. Building good relationships isn't just something that happens to you; it's a skill that you can learn. In my course Better Relationships in 30 days, I'll walk you through the process of fostering appreciation, improving communication. You'll learn how to make repairs and restore those feelings of warmth"
No," and love. You really can learn to transform conflict into connection this holiday season. So check out the link in the description to learn more. The health anxiety cycle usually starts with something like a sensation in your body or even just hearing about someone else's illness. Now, here's the first thing that you might do that makes health anxiety worse, and this is meaningmaking. This is especially common with somatization disorder. So it's it's saying something like, ""Oh, if I have this sensation, it must mean something."" It's asking, ""Why am I feeling this?"" Now, your brain hates unanswered questions, so it's going to invent"
No," something to fill in that blank. So it might go something like this: you might think, ""Oh my gosh, this sniffle means I have COVID and I'm going to die."" Or you have a headache and you think, ""This headache must mean that I have brain cancer and I'm going to leave my children fatherless."" So so what are the stories that you tell yourself when you're worried about your health? Now, let me tell you a story. This last summer I was climbing the Grand Teton with my dad and some old friends. We were all experienced climbers, and on the second day about 5 am we were scrambling up the approach to the Exum Ridge, and we came to an area called Wall Street. This is a narrow ramp"
No," about five feet wide, and it runs along the south ridge of the Grand Teton. And as you walk along, it it gets narrower and narrower. Oh, and there's about a thousand foot drop beneath you. Now, my friends and I have done stuff like this for years, but I took a long break after having kids, so I was a little out of practice, you know, with heights and and stuff. So I mean, just so you guys know, I am actually afraid of heights, but the more I climb, the less I worry. And that's kind of how your brain works, right? The more you expose yourself to something that feels dangerous but is actually safe, your anxiety levels actually drop. But I haven't been climbing for a long time,"
No," this is my first time with this much exposure, it's like 5 am, it's freezing cold. So we're basically transitioning from the hike part to the climb part of this, the ascent on this mountain. Um we stopped to get our ropes out and to get our harnesses on and and to get all our gear ready. And in that moment I got struck with this intense feeling of fear, and and I wondered what it meant. Was it a premonition? It's it seemed like it was saying ""Something terrible is going to happen. Turn around."" And I was really scared. I almost told my friends, ""We should turn around. This isn't going to end well,"" you know. I believed that because I was feeling this way"
No," that it meant something. So so in that moment I checked myself and I asked ""Is this a premonition, or is this anxiety speaking?"" The sky was clear, my friends and I were prepared, I'd led this route before. And in that quiet moment, I knew it was just fear speaking. We continued upward, and then we summited that morning to a beautiful, clear sky and a safe descent. Okay. So back to meaningmaking. When we feel anxiety or when we feel a symptom like a headache or a heart, a fast heartbeat or something, instead of asking ""Why am I feeling this? What does this mean?"" say ""Oh, this is just a sensation."" Or you could say, like I did on the climb, ""Oh, this is anxiety speaking,"
No," right? Just because I feel scared doesn't mean I'm in danger. Just because I think stuff doesn't mean I'm actually sick. Just because I have a sensation like a headache or heart heart palpitation, that doesn't mean that I'm actually sick. These are just sensations. Thoughts, sensations, and emotions are just that: they're passing experiences, but they don't necessarily mean something. So instead of trying to figure out what this means or why am I feeling this, learn to make space for sensations without needing them to mean something. Spending hours of your life trying to get to the root of why you're feeling something"
No," is going to distract you from your life purpose. So allow yourself to feel the sensation it's it's just a sensation without needing to figure out why or make a meaning of it. And and mindfulness practice is a really practical way to learn how to do this. Okay. The second thing you might do that makes health anxiety worse, that contributes to this health anxiety cycle is catastrophizing. Catastrophizing is when, you know, if something is uncomfortable or worrisome, you take it to the extreme, and you believe that the most extreme version must be true. So you think ""I feel so tired,"" and then you think ""Oh no, what if I'm tired because I have"
No," some horrible autoimmune disease? Then I won't be able to work, and then we'll lose the house, and then my children will starve, and I won't be able to handle it. It's the end of the world,"" right? When in reality you're tired because you worked a long day, a long week, and your kids keep you up at night. When we take a feeling or a thought and we catastrophize, it activates that fight/flight/freeze response. And this can actually heighten our physical sensations. It makes your heart race and your breathing faster, and it can increase your muscle tension. So this can actually make your symptoms seem worse. It's also going to make your anxiety"
No," feel worse. So what do you do instead? Label it as catastrophizing. Learn to recognize the voice that anxiety speaks in, right? Catastrophizing uses terms like ""must,"" ""have to,"" ""always,"" ""never,"" and extreme terms like ""death"" and ""doom."" Write a list of your most common health anxiety thoughts so that when they show up, you can recognize them as anxiety or fears and not as reality. I like to draw little pictures with silly hats on my fears because it helps me to see them as they are. These are fears, not facts. Now, the next thing I'm going to say is a little bit tricky because it works well with regular anxiety, but it doesn't work super well with OCD. So if you have an OC,"
No," more of an OCD style of health anxiety, don't do this. But you can also check for alternatives, right? Catastrophizing is just one explanation out of many. So you might be tired because you're hungry. You might be tired because you're anxious. You might be tired because you had a long workout that day. You you can tell it's catastrophizing if there's a lot of options for why you're tired, but you're sure that the worst one is the one that's most likely. So if you want to learn more about catastrophizing, check out my video on the on the topic. Okay. So the third thing that makes health anxiety worse is googling. It's it's saying, ""Oh, I'm going to spend tons of time"
No," scanning the internet for verification that my fears are true."" This is like pouring gas on the anxiety fire. It just fuels that fear. Because yes, a headache could be a symptom of about a thousand disorders, but most of the time it's just a headache. But when you seek reassurance by searching the internet, you probably feel better for just a moment. You feel this little sense of relief, or like you're doing something. But then this actually trains your brain to feel more anxious and to need more reassurance. It makes your anxiety worse. Check out my video on how anxiety is like a toddler at the grocery store because the more tantrums it throws and the more"
No," you give into it with reassuranceseeking, the worse your anxiety is going to get. So instead of seeking reassurance on the internet, consult a doctor once, and then limit the amount of time seeking reassurance. So you can set an actual numerical limit on how much time you can spend searching your symptoms. And then redirect your attention to what makes your life rich and meaningful instead of constantly focusing on a perceived danger, because what we focus on, we get more of. That is how the brain works. So you just kind of let your anxiety throw a tantrum. You say ""Hello, anxiety. Nice to see you again,"" but you don't have to give in. So you redirect"
Environment," your attention and energy to what matters to you. Now, specifically, like if you worry about COVID, it can be easy to go to the extremes to try and protect yourself from this. And what the OCD community is saying, the OCD practitioners are saying, is set a reasonable boundary around what safety behaviors you're going to do. And what the OCD community is saying, the OCD practitioners are saying, is choose to follow CDC guidelines as your standard, but don't allow yourself to make up a ton of extra rules in your head that you have to follow to be okay, because that's going to be feeding that health anxiety or that OCD."
No," Okay. The fourth thing that can contribute to the health anxiety cycle is getting unnecessary tests. So this is another form of checking. This is constantly seeking reassurance, and this is a subtle form of avoidance. Every time you seek to reassure your anxiety by getting another test, it's like trying to get your toddler to behave better by giving them a candy bar for throwing a tantrum. Endlessly seeking reassurance is going to sap your life and your time and your energy. So instead of seeking reassurance over and over, choose to spend your time on the things most important to you. One of the ways you can tell if a worry is meaningful or is anxiety is that"
No," anxiety almost tells you to withdraw or to focus all of your energy and attention on your fears, on getting your symptoms checked. So so just clarify your values. What do you want your life to be about? Then ask yourself, ""Do these thoughts and feelings, these worries about your health, do they help you live a rich and meaningful life?"" If not, then redirect yourself to what you do want your life to be about, and then choose to show up, show up to your own life. Limit the amount of time you can spend checking on your symptoms, and choose to do what's more important to you. Okay. The fifth thing that you might do that makes health anxiety worse is seeking certainty."
No," It's saying, ""I have to know for sure, or else I can't live my life."" So you check and you check, and you ask more doctors, and you run more tests, and you spend more time googling. And if you count the hours you're spending on your health anxiety or if you count the things you're missing because of your anxiety, you'll see that checking is getting in the way of living your life. So instead, accept that uncertainty is a part of life. Seeking to eliminate uncertainty will use up tons of time, and it's also fruitless. If you don't believe me, check yourself right now. Has seeking certainty helped you feel more certain? Like, the more certainty you seek,"
No," do you feel better? If you're watching this video because you have health anxiety, it probably hasn't helped in the long run. This process is about getting comfortable with uncomfortable feelings. This is called the distress tolerance. With health anxiety, it sounds like saying, ""I can't know for sure. I might have some disease that I don't know about, but I've checked enough, and now I'm going to accept that uncertainty and live my life."" Give yourself a mantra like, ""I can do hard things"" or ""I can feel the fear and do it anyway. I can feel the fear, and I can go to my kid's soccer game anyway, and I can be as present as possible."
No," The ability to feel a little uncomfortable and allow it to be there instead of trying to force it to go away is really an essential skill, and it's what I call getting better at feeling. I like to practice this by doing physical challenges like rock climbing or hiking, but there's other ways to practice it too. Allowing yourself to feel your emotions, journaling, making music and art that express your emotions, and then other things like taking cold showers, fasting, or or challenging yourself to do something that scares you. And as you practice this ,as you face your anxiety without trying to reassure it or check or google it or try to"
No," make it go away, your anxiety will actually most likely go down. This is the paradox of anxiety. Your addiction to checking will decrease. And whether your anxiety goes down or not, you'll be better at living the life you value. In the end, health anxiety doesn't need to control your life. But the tricky problem is that if you only focus on making fears go away, you'll often do things that make anxiety worse in the long run. So just to summarize: these are things like avoiding activities, researching your symptoms, seeking reassurance, and catastrophizing. These all make your anxiety worse in the long run. So instead, I encourage you to get better at feeling. Get"
No," better at allowing yourself to feel the anxiety and choose to live the life the way you want to anyway. Okay. I hope that's helpful. Thank you for watching, and take care."

Biological factors that can contribute to the development of depression include genetics, hormonal imbalances, and neurochemical imbalances. Individuals with a family history of depression may have an increased risk of developing the disorder."
No," Hormonal imbalances, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menopause, can also lead to the development of depression. Additionally, imbalances in neurochemicals, such as serotonin and dopamine, can also play a role in the onset of depression. Psychological factors that can contribute to the development of depression include past trauma or stressful life events, negative thinking patterns, and low selfesteem. Individuals who have experienced trauma, such as abuse or neglect, may be at a higher risk"
No," of developing depression. Additionally, negative thinking patterns, such as selfcriticism or rumination, can contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression. Low selfesteem can also lead to feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, which are common symptoms of depression. Social factors that can contribute to the development of depression include social isolation, lack of social support, and interpersonal conflicts."
No," Individuals who lack social support or are socially isolated may be at a higher risk of developing depression. Additionally, interpersonal conflicts, such as relationship or workrelated stress, can also lead to the onset of depression. Environmental factors that can contribute to the development of depression include exposure to stressful or traumatic life events, such as the death of a loved one, financial stress, or major life changes."

Antidepressant medications can be effective in managing depression symptoms."
No," Common types of antidepressants include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

No, Hi everybody it 's a pleasure to be here with you today and i 'm happy to be talking a little bit more about a subject that i think is pretty important and that is chronic illness and mental health .
No," Now mental health is a subject that i think is really important for everybody , but i do think that for folks navigating chronic illness , whether as a patient or as a caregiver , there are some nuances that do n't quite resonate with other people"
No," , including some stays that lasted longer than a month , lots of different medications , lots of different procedures , and so , by the time she came To us on dialysis , we were able to observe pretty quickly signs of anxiety and depression"
No," for her , but actually also for her mom , because for any of you who are caregivers , who are parents , you know that you are going through it with your child . So , while this patient was spending a month or more in the hospital , mom was"
No," laying next to her . In a cot , when this patient was in the or mom , was waiting in the waiting room with baited breath , the family took our suggestion and they started seeing a therapist which is great"
No," part of my job , as the social worker was to liaise with community organizations . And so this family wanted me to talk with their therapist gave me consent , and so i began coordinating with this outpatient therapist . This therapist was awesome"
Environment," , but it became evident that she , she really was not familiar with the medical world . She needed a lot of education . She did n't quite understand how medications or procedures or dialysis could affect mood or cognition"
No," need need more personalized or individualized mental health Care , so what i hope to cover with you today is first go over some mental health basics , and then i want to move into how chronic"
No," illness can affect our mental health , go over some nuances , some implications and then finally , i want to offer you guys some Suggestions for moving forward now before that . I actually want you to check in with yourselves for a minute"
No," Anything else ! Oh i did n't hear that one balance . Yes , fear ! That 'S a big one ! That 'S a big one ! We do have microphones"
No," by the way , if you want to shout depression , stigma very big , that 's a huge factor . Yep access"
No," especially apt . Given this talk right , okay , thank you guys . All of those were great , so i wanted to get a sense of what you guys think mental health is because this is a term that i think is"
No," so here 's a definition . Mental health includes our emotional , psychological and social wellbeing . It affects how we think feel and act . It also helps determine how we handle stress , relate to others and make healthy choices . So again , i think mental health"
No," is used often to describe any one of these things , but i would argue , as would the cdc , that mental health is actually the point of convergence of all of these things . All of these things need care ."
No," Mental health is super diverse . It 'S normal to experience a spectrum of emotions and feelings , and we all can probably think of a few people who who their spectrum may be different than ours . We may have some more stoic friends or"
No," more effervescent friends , but it is normal to experience the bad and the good , and i would actually argue if we 're not deeply feeling the negative or the bad we 're not able to deeply feel the awesome and exciting ."
No," There are a lot of mental health diagnoses , but today we 're going to focus on three of the most common and wellknown ones which are anxiety , depression and trauma . Like medical diagnoses , we use standardized criteria to establish"
No," diagnosis . We find this in the diagnostic and statistical manual or affectionately , known as the dsm5 and diagnosis can come from genetics , biologic imbalances or experiences . For example , we know that with anxiety"
No," and depression , there is a tremendous genetic component , tremendous with biologic imbalances , we 're talking about our diet or medications , we 're taking or supplements that we 're taking . These can all affect our mood and cognition"
No," , unlike medical diagnoses , few people mentioned this mental health often carries with it significant stigma . That makes many folks apprehensive about getting care , despite there being care available , we 're making great strides , but there 's"
No," still a long way to go in terms of the stigma . I want to start with anxiety . I might spend a little bit more time here than i should just because anxiety is so normal , and the majority of my clients have"
No," anxiety so just way too familiar with this . So anxiety is so common that it 's roughly one in three people , the nih states that an estimated 19.1 percent of u.s adults experience anxiety in a given year"
No," and that an estimated 31.1 percent of u.s adults will have an anxiety disorder in their lifetime . An estimated 31.9 percent of adolescents experience anxiety and , of course , since we are now living in a world"
No," postpandemic onset , there 's been a lot of research into how our collective moods have changed , and the world health organization has estimated that there 's been a global surge of about 25 in cases of anxiety , so whenever i have a new client starting"
No," with me , and they want to work on anxiety , i start with psychoeducation . First thing i emphasize is anxiety is normal . In fact , anxiety is a healthy mindbody function"
No," when we think about what our brains are designed to do on its most primitive level , our brains are designed to keep us alive , keep us safe , its focus is survival and anxiety is one of the main"
No," mechanisms . Our brain can do that so when there is a perceived danger or threat anxiety is triggered , and then our brain floods , our bodies with two different hormones , cortisol and adrenaline ."
No," , guys we 're good , but if you have an anxiety disorder , your brain does n't necessarily do that , and so , even though there is no more perceived threat or danger , you 're still feeling scared , you 're"
No," Feeling wired , you 're , feeling hyperactive , hyper vigilant , you 'll feel really worn out and exhausted . Now the more anxiety that we experience , whether this is legitimate or whether it 's through a disorder"
No," , our baseline to handle anxiety , changes and so we 'll notice that our capacity shifts and our ability to tolerate distress decreases . And so this might look like someone who 's . Just anxious . All the time , someone"
No," who has that tendency to anticipate worst case scenario , someone who 's thinking , oh gosh , what if or did i forget or what will happen even in the most benign situations , what 's also interesting about our brains , keeping in mind that its job is to keep"
No," Us safe is that our brains are designed to catalog negative experiences , including anxiety , and so , if you have a really negative experience in a particular place , let 's take a doctor 's office . For example , you get distressed , you get upset . Your"
No," brain is triggering anxiety because it wants to keep you safe . It 'S sensing a threat subsequent times you go to the doctor 's office , you 're , probably going to be feeling anxiety , because your brain is saying we 've been here before , and there"
No," negative or look out for the negative and not the great stuff . So when we talk about how our brains can shift under anxiety , it can lead to again increased hyper , hypervigilance and hyperactivity to threats , brain anatomy , changes which then leads to a decreased"
No," ability to process things rationally . Some symptoms of anxiety , i 'm assuming many of us - have had these . They include racing and pounding heart change in breathing or shortness of breath , muscle tension , feeling hot sweaty"
No," changes in sleep dizziness and from an emotional standpoint . This can include poor memory . Irritability , feelings of dread avoidance , fear of losing control ."
No," So now , let 's move into depression . This thing so depression is common , though we do n't think as common as anxiety , the nih reports that an estimated 8.5 of adults were diagnosed with major depressive disorder"
No, before the pandemic and again being a postpandemic world . A study that was conducted in 2020 showed that depression rates tripled in light of covet 19. depression is a persistent feeling of
No," sadness , loss of interest and hopelessness . It often includes changes in eating and sleeping in lack of energy and motivation , loss of focus and ability to concentrate and a sense of worthlessness ."
No," In extreme cases , individuals may feel suicidal ongoing . Untreated depression like anxiety , can affect the anatomy of our brain . So remember with our brain : we have what 's called neuroplasticity , which is"
No," I want to emphasize this with depression again , that among the causes for depression can include , genetics , stress and chemical imbalances . This is not because it 's your fault , it 's not because you"
No," are weak . There are variables here that are out of your control . Let 'S take a look at a couple symptoms of depression , so we have trouble with memory , focus or concentration or what we would call brain fog"
No," , loss of interest in things that you typically love , fatigue or lack of energy . Physical symptoms such as aches and pains , including headaches and digestive issues , those tend to be the more common ones"
No," , feelings of hopelessness , worthlessness , emptiness and numbness disruptions in sleep and eating patterns , increased agitation , irritability and anxiety . Now , there 's something important with depression"
No, Sometimes i like to laugh at those depression commercials because they 're like are you sad ? Do you need this med ? We all get sad that we 're supposed to sometimes be sad um .
No," So when it comes to talking about depression , it 's not just about the symptoms . We want to know how many symptoms you 're having at a time we want to know how long you have been consistently feeling those symptoms"
No," and that would be appropriate . So when it comes to depression , it 's very multifactorial . It 'S not just . Oh , i feel sad or oh , i 'm losing some memory . It 'S a little bit more nuanced than that . So now we 're going to talk about trauma"
No," and trauma is we 're learning so much more about trauma . The research has been amazing , we 're learning so much more about how trauma works , and this is leading to excellent and efficient treatment for trauma ."
No, One of the biggest things that we 're learning is that trauma what causes trauma trauma responses is not nearly as rigid as perhaps we thought it was even 10 15 years ago . I 'M of the belief that trauma can
No," An extreme mood swings , physical symptoms may be present as well , including muscle muscle tension , sleep disturbances and aches and pains trauma is becoming so normalized that most nontrauma specialists are being taught what 's called traumainformed"
No," specialist . They have access to treatments that the rest of us do n't have things like emdr or neurofeedback or tms , and these treatments actually target those brain anatomy changes we 're talking about . It 'S really exciting ."
No," In fact , those same treatments are now being applied to the treatment of depression and anxiety , with really promising results , we 're also finding with depression . I 'M sorry with um trauma that there 's a genetic component to this"
No," as well , which we never really considered . This was first discovered in a study of the descendants of holocaust survivors when grandchildren of holocaust survivors were demonstrating trauma responses for no reason"
No," for someone that you love , i want to emphasize . None of this is set in stone . There is treatment for all of this . There is support available or should be available . A few people mentioned accessibility"
No," over here that could be its own session talk , accessibility of mental health . So when we talk about chronic illness , it can cause a lot of emotional reactions , including fear"
No," , anger , uncertainty , guilt and grief , and all of these are normal , and all of these are okay . There are unique logistical challenges that come with chronic illness and we 'll go over a couple of those ."
No," There can be significant social implications , including and perhaps particularly within our own families , as roles are changing to adapt to an illness . All of a sudden we 're not just mom and kid we 're caregiver and patient"
No," so like we did with mental health , i would love to know what your thoughts or what words come to your mind when we think chronic illness there are microphones or you can shout if You'Re really loud i 'll start"
No," forever . Sadness struggle struggle , fear struggle , expensive , yes , alone alone . Oh yes"
No," someone handed you a bomb and you 're , not sure when it 's going to go off , and then i also hear a lot about relationships , particularly within the family . How hard that is now i came across a video um ."
No," , i know many of you will not progress to the advanced state she has been in , but i think i think she may be able to give some language to some of your experiences , or at least i Hope it resonates a bit if we can get it to play ."
No," encourage you to look it up because she gets very vulnerable around how her family dynamics have changed in light of being the dedicated identified patient . So let 's go back to the idea of uncertainty , uncertainty"
No," and overall wellbeing in addition , threat , creates significant impairments in your working memory . You ca n't hold on to as many ideas in your mind to solve problems . Nor can you pull as much information from your"
No," longterm memory when you need it . Threats of uncertainty literally makes us less capable , because dealing with them is just not something our brains evolve . To do so , this article was written in response to covid"
No," because , of course , with covid , the entire world was in this state of chronic uncertainty . We were going day to day , not knowing what was happening . Sometimes it felt hour to hour , and so now there 's more research into"
No," you 're tube dependent , you also need to coordinate with most likely a specialty pharmacy , which adds another layer ? But if someone were to ask me , what 's the most challenging part of health care , i would have to say insurance"
No," and i heard a lot of sounds so i 'm going to ask what might sound like a facetious question , how many people here have felt victimized by their Insurance company - it 's pretty much everybody - this is something we could spend all day on ."
No," Insurance is neither intuitive or clear . I remember as a social worker , so part of my job as a social worker was to interact with insurance companies . Try to get things covered , try to help navigate"
No," take ? Instead , doctors get very frustrated by that , because the doctors are on the back end , trying to argue with insurance companies saying we want this med for a reason , stop saying it 's not covered . This is what the patient needs"
Environment," how it is in different states , but some states are particularly supportive of children with chronic illness and will provide medical assistance regardless of income and regardless of other coverage , some do n't . And so when i was working in"
No," philadelphia , we had several families who literally uprooted their lives in new jersey and moved to pennsylvania , where the coverage was more supportive , like how ridiculous is that i mean it seems ridiculous to me to have to uproot"
No," your life to Ensure your child gets all the care that they should get , but this is insurance and so we 're not going to fix insurance here . I just want to validate for you . This is a very big deal"
No," This also came up a lot at chop so again with peds patients . It 'S incredible how many schools do n't get it , and so that is another layer of frustration for both patient the child and the parents trying to ensure that their child is getting the"
No," the sister was playing , and so the parents were then faced with a choice . Okay , who gets to go and celebrate this with our one child and who is going to stay here with our other child who needs this lifesaving treatment ?"
No," So what happened was one parent and the patient had to miss out on a really exciting event for another person ? In their family , care needs may dictate how you can socialize . This might be"
No," , you 're literally tied to a machine , and you do it all night . While you sleep this patient needed to be on her dialysis machine longer than average , and so she was hooked up to her machine around 4 4 30 in the afternoon . So less than two hours after she 'd get"
No," home from school , so this 15 year old could n't even go and have dinner with her friends . She could n't go and hang out with her friends after school and this led to significant depression"
No," and she actually required advanced care . Mental health care , but who , who would n't be at 15 years old , having to spend more than half your day tied to a machine in your bed ? So now we 're going to go to family roles , how they change"
No," both caregivers . Oh thank you . Oh great timing , so we 're going to go back to the sarah highland video , let 's see if i can get back here , i swear to god . This thing help me ."
No," you 've been through . As a human being about geez , seven years ago , i had my kidney transplant . My dad gave me his , but what most people do n't know is that about two years ago exactly i went into rejection"
No," , saying that out loud is weird whoa . I do n't cry this , is you know when a family member gives you a second chance at life and it fails ? It almost feels like it 's your fault , and it 's not"
No," , but it does . We did all of these uh tests and um all of these treatments to try and save the kidney , but they basically said the transplanted kidney was like a house that caught on fire , you ca n't unburn a house ."
No," october of 2017 . In about july , we found out that my brother was the match . It was really exciting , but there was still a lot to process when a second family member someone who you 're supposed to look after"
No," It keeps going . If you would like to see it , you can hear more of her story online and again , if you do n't recognize her , she plays one of the kids in the tv show modern family which , if you 've not seen that show you"
No," of you are not going to get as far as her . But i hope that some of what she said resonated a bit for you . So back to the social challenges talking about family roles , um"
No, came to me she was crying she was so upset . Actually i think it was following an insurance issue and she said to me : oh my god . I just want to be a mom . I do n't want to have to be a case
No, manager . I do n't want to have to be my kid 's nurse . Why ca n't ? I just be a mom . I have another patient in my practice who came to me : they have als advanced als and they and their partner
No," , and i think that is something that is very important to do work around , because while it is normal while guilt , shame frustration , anxiety , depression , grief and anger are all normal ."
No," nephrologist . Every case is different . You want to talk to your doctor about how your particular presentation and your medication may affect your mood and cognitive functioning , because our mental health can be"
No," significantly affected by meds think about steroids , which is very common for renal replacement therapy . When we 're talking about transplant . We know that steroids can increase risk of irritability agitation , almost manic like episodes"
No, caregivers . Maybe there 's a few friends or connections you 've made in your program and you try to get together every now and again for coffee . Maybe you have a few trusted friends and family members who you can talk
No," It is appropriate for many people . In fact , in mental health . We talk about something called combination . Therapy combination therapy is when someone is working with a doctor and medication and working with a therapist in therapy"
No," illness or when you 're on a lot of other medications . It is essential that you talk with your nephrologist . If you want to know more about anxiety , depression meds , to see what would be appropriate for you now , the next building on or working on"
No," , building acceptance and flexibility . This is not the same as giving up . This is really really important , there 's actually a whole sub um . Where do i want to use there 's an entire form of therapy"
No, and There 'S something very powerful about that . The next thing i want to talk about is identifying and identifying where you can still have control . So this is a big thing and i 'm thinking back to some of the things that you guys
No," , but where maybe she can find alternative routes or maybe she can have a favorite playlist or a podcast or an audiobook playing . She also wanted to try to get friends or"
No," family members with her , so she had somebody to talk to on the drive for my client who had problems with uh the smell she decided . She was gon na start , going everywhere with essential oils , which i think is pretty on trend for"
No," most people , but she has her essential oils and she 'll turn to that . If the smell is getting her upset , another way that you can learn to try to gain some control is learning to anticipate"
No," , and now this is not the same as anxiety , though they 're they can look similar . When i 'm talking about learning to anticipate it 's looking ahead and based on previous experiences , making educated guesses about what could unfold"
No," How could we plan so maybe before you even leave , you begin to think you know what this has happened before or we 've heard other families experience this . So , let 's just let 's just make a plan in case this happens , maybe we bring a bag ."
No," Maybe i set up alternative care , child care for the kids at home . Maybe it 's talking with your child and saying hey . This might happen . What are some things you would want to bring so that , if you end up in the hospital , you 'll have something"
No," just having that discussion will help prepare your child so that they wo n't be caught off guard , maybe you 're bringing work from work , and maybe that your child Is going to bring work from school"
No," like uncertainty , we 're taking care of our brain by giving it a soft place to land and Hang out for a little bit , and this can be anything it can be . You know your traditional meditation prayer or devotions"
No," , or it could be having a phone call with a friend . It could be reading a book . It could be going for a walk . It could be anything , but it 's the same thing consistently for my patient . It was meditation . One thing she was really upset about was"
No," so now she knew that , no matter how she was feeling physically . She would still have her moment of meditation every day at the same time . Every day it just might be in a different location , so think about that . What are some things that you might do now"
No," Remember when doing this , though it 's not about what you 're focusing on it 's simply about the focus itself . So if you 're thinking , what do i taste , you can taste the back of your teeth ? Nothing profound needs to be happening and what you 're focusing on we just want ."
No," an hour , what you 're doing with this breath work is you 're , actually interrupting the cycle of anxiety . So if you think back to how our brain and body and those chemicals are are running all over the place"
No," , taking deep breaths is a counter message back to the brain that says we do n't have to fight flight or freeze we 're taking deep breaths we 're safe . It 'S okay . I actually encourage people to do this like regardless of anxiety level . Just like do it in the morning . Do it in the"
Environment," evening get in the practice of doing it , because , if something 's a habit , it makes it a lot more likely that you 're gon na pull from it when you 're in a moment of anxiety or crisis now . Finally , the last exercise : that 's in your handouts , is a"
Environment," While you do the practice or what some of my clients have done , is they 've recorded themselves , reading the exercise and then played it while they did it . This is another really great grounding activity and it teaches you some of the stuff that 's discussed in the act , type"
No," of therapy learning to it just notice and accept you , do n't have to change it , you 're just noticing that nonjudgmental acceptance and it 's really important . So again , one of the handouts that you guys should have"
No," there 's nothing worse than someone going into therapy they 're not into it they 're , not ready . You can only do so much , but the purpose of therapy is to give you time . That 'S intentionally set aside for yourself and when you 're a caregiver"
No," , okay guys ? Well , i want to thank you very much for coming to my talk . I hope that this was helpful and now i would love to know . If any of you have any questions , we have some mics around the room ."
No," and we have a really really good children 's hospital . She still qualifies to go to the children 's hospital she 's 19 now , but um we 're just . We have , we also have a social worker but"
No," , because there are a lot of limits . Many therapists do not accept medicare um , so i guess my question to you is : would you be open to paying out of pocket and then getting reimbursement through ? If you have any other insurance ? Besides medicare"
No," , we would , and we my wife and i have even discussed like just paying for therapy . Unfortunately , our daughter wants - i mean not unfortunately , but she wants to be independent . She does n't want mom and dad paying for everything . You"
No," know that 's been kind of the the struggle lately . She feels guilty for us paying for things out of pocket when we have to so , even if there 's a possibility that we 'll get reimbursed . We have to talk that through with her , because i try to tell her and my wife"
No," tries to tell her do n't worry about it , we 'll get it taken care of , but it 's a big source of anxiety and shame and guilt for her . That know that , even occasionally we are paying for things , even though we tell her that 's fine , we"
No," insurance , but i do give my clients , what 's called super bills at the end of each month , so that they can submit that to their insurance and then they 'll Get reimbursed the money that they paid me more and more therapists are following that model , because , if you sign up to"
No," like actually work with insurance , it can , i believe it compromises the way we can practice , and so i would really encourage you to consider that if , If it 's a possibility , another thing would be if you find a"
No," therapist that does look interesting or that you 'd be interested in trying and they are accepting new clients talking with them about about the financial issues . Perhaps you 've done this , but lots of therapists have sliding scales they like to work with families"
No, department as if they were any other patient or any other child and make an appointment with that department . With that division and be seen - and i know at chop - the wait list was pretty long - i 'm not sure what it would be like at your hospital .
No," an adult and with medicare medicaid . Unfortunately , as an adult , you do n't get the same care like a child does but check to see if they have a support group . I know that emory university had asked"
No," So , for instance , when i look for a nephrologist , i look for somebody who is knowledgeable can understand the disease um and those kind of things and they 're , not all the same right . So when you go to a mental health professional - and you talk"
No," um ? How do i change that mindset because , obviously , looking for a mental health professional is , is the outcome is going to be a little bit different than what i would get from a nephrologist ? I would assume um ."
No," I guess i feel like . I need to learn how to change the mindset of when i 'm looking for a mental health professional . So how do you do that ? So if i 'm hearing you correctly , your question is um : how do you"
No," in the va healthcare system when they approach ptsd , i feel like they try and make improvements in treatment . But it 's more like here 's a phone number when you want to"
No," kill yourself like call this number yeah , and then it 's not really like a treatment . It 'S not really like a lot of help . It 'S it 's just like . We have avenues that you can go down when you feel a certain way um or take these drugs , so you do n't feel"
No," that way , anymore yeah and we kind of just cover it up , yeah , so um . I hope i 'm going to answer this question from a few different angles , so it sounds like what would be really"
No," Did you know that ongoing feelings of apprehension and fear or just nervousness , can rob people of their quality of life and negatively impact their health ? So what about you ? Are you having irrational fears , mood"
No," , swings , racing , thoughts , insomnia and are you being overwhelmed well ? If so , then you are jeopardizing your health , and this is why you need our stress and anxiety relief pack ."
No," It relieves stress and anxiety , naturally , because we use whole food herbs and nutrients , and you will feel results quickly because our opti blend delivery system ensures nutrients absorb fast and deliver results"
No," , and it contains 100 stress and anxiety , relieving herbs , vitamins and minerals , probiotics and enzymes , and Our magnesium , as well as our calcium and probiotics , are patented to deliver results . You ca n't get anywhere else so stop the worry , panic , irrational fears"
No," , anxiety and depression and start to physically relax calm . Your mind think clearly feel happy and feel like yourself again."
No," Committee Member on our London Branch who 's going to talk to us today about personal resilience , stress and mental health , so I 'm going to immediately hand over to you Rosie . Thank you very much Greg . So there 's a few things I 'd like to to"
No," cover over the next 40 minutes or so . First of all , we 've had a background about mental health , but also I 'd like to take a look at stress and what it is I 'd like to talk about the cognitive behavioral model and then a model of personal resilience , and then I 'd be"
No," quite happy to take questions . At the end - but this really is my starting point - is that we all have mental health , mental health as a phrase has this negative connotation , yet it actually merely it just refers to how we think feel behave and interact"
No," with other people . It 'S not positive . It 'S not negative . We have mental health in the same way that we have physical health . Now , hopefully , you 'll be able to hear this um there 's a short video . This was"
No," published by the HSE back in 2002 as part of their launch of Stress Management standards and Tony 's . Going to talk a little bit about his experience with depression , the worst thing about depression is that when you 're in it it 's hard to"
No," I started crying my boss suggested I go and see my GP , you know I did n't even realize it was depression until my GP diagnosed it . I thought I was just a bit down . I mean fine when I was supposedly had to press something"
No," on my GPS advice . I was signed off with depression . I did n't want anyone at work . No , I had depression , I mean the guys at work , did n't know what to do so . They just kind of stayed away . I think that I found it easier if I 'd"
No," have had , I do n't know heart attack or something most days did n't want to get out of bed honestly . The main reason I got out of bed was because the dog need to walk in , and my wife had to go to work so we 'll get up"
No," , walk the dog , take it to work and come back some days . I 'D go back to bed some days . I 'D just sit on the couch and wonder what was I doing next , I was n't able to talk in a normal way to friends and family about anything , let"
No," alone how awful I was feeling it 's the cliche , but it was like a black cloud was following me around Anyway , I do feel better now : I 've had treatment which is ongoing and I 've been easier on myself . There are a lot of people , who 'd be in"
No," It 'S really surprised me how understanding it 's been , but I found out that his wife 's , a depression too so he 's been able to understand to a certain degree to start making impact on you . I think the thing that uh Tony"
No," underlines here really is that he did n't talk about a cause as to why he was feeling like this . In fact , there does n't need to be a cause , uh people who suffer from stress and depression . It is very personal as to"
No," what 's going on there and what stresses or causes a problem for us might not for somebody else . The other thing is Tony talks there about treatment , and actually the great news when we 're talking about mental ill health is that the vast majority of"
No," people who suffer from with a mental ill health recover fully and live their lives to the full , but mental health costs . Every economy um and back in 2017 , the um the government of the day , commissioned the Stephen Stevenson"
No," farmer report . They wanted to take a look at what was mental health cost in the UK economy and they came up with some to be quite Frank , quite shocking figures of 74 to 99 billion pounds per annum . Now this was underpinned by a piece of work"
Environment," two thousand three four hundred pounds in today 's prices : uh per person of working age . If we also take a look at the health and safety executive statistics for work , related stress , anxiety and depression , we find it is the top cause of Occupational"
Environment," and safety professional , this to me is - should almost be our number one target for improving the mental health of people at work and the statistics they are useful . They underline actually how much of a problem we 're trying to tackle here"
No," , but they miss the moral cost and personal impact on an individual now , globally , there are one in six people currently suffering from mental health condition . Half of those will be suffering with a severe mental health condition ."
No," Now here , I 'd like to challenge people 's perspective or perception on people with a mental health condition , an ill health condition . An awful lot of those with a current mental health condition can actually be working and living a normal life with appropriate support , whether"
No," that be talking therapies , antidepressants many other treatments as well , so people , you know , will have mental health conditions . Now I want to introduce you to the"
No," mental health Pain Scale . This was um first published on the Internet by someone who goes by the tag , the graceful patient and it 's a very useful insight into . What 'S going on inside the head of someone going through mental ill health"
No," maybe a few bad days , but you 've got the skills to get through it , and perhaps you know friends being around some selfcare strategies . It might just be something as simple as saying : no I 'm not going out this evening , I 'm going to have a nice bath in an"
No," this point are starting to feel maybe helpless , somewhat worthless , and a lot of them will not go and talk to the doctor . So they 'll end up at six now here you ca n't do things the way you usually do due to your mental health ."
Environment," There 'S a lot of noise going on in your head , impulsive , compulsive thoughts , you 're ruminating over things . Life is now actually starting to get really quite hard and at seven we are now into the more severe end of mental distress ."
No," You'Re , avoiding things that make you more distressed problem is that 's going to make it worse , so you might be avoiding social situations where actually , you might recharge from being around your friends . You are avoiding things like opening the"
No," mail , because you 're convincing yourself there 's going to be bad news in there . This is actually quite serious and you definitely need help now at eight , though , ca n't hide your struggles anymore . Your friends and family are now noticing"
No," , because you 're having issues with sleeping eating having fun socializing working studying your mental health is affecting almost all parts of your life and we 've all met this person . But what 's interesting I find about this scale is that"
No," do n't feel worth it ? They do n't feel that anybody would respond . So when we find a friend or a colleague or a member of the family , that is obviously struggling , it 's actually incumbent on us to reach in and reaching in is far more powerful"
No," This is where you should be sitting with somebody in phoning the local crisis line or , if they 're , in immediate danger to themselves calling the police who have the powers under the mental health Act . So this for me , is a very useful resource"
No," to actually communicate where somebody is , and it is worth remembering that the degree of distress is personal . You do n't need to have it worse than others to be in distress , because if you ca n't be distressed"
Environment," Now , from an occupational point of view , stress is something that we should all be aware of . After all , it was 2002 when the health and safety executive first published the Stress Management standards . They'Ve been improvised and updated"
Environment," and you 're , not that can actually become a negative same with relationships if you 're working in a good , supportive environment , where the relationships between your colleagues is cooperative and collaborative"
No," starts to shut down now , if this is a good workplace , there will Be support there . There will be good relationships that could contribute to someone getting through this stressful period , but stress relates to mental health and"
No," your level of mental health . And if you go back to the mental health Pain Scale , you 'll find that , as you start drifting down that scale , you are ever less likely to ask for help . You try and dig yourself out of the hole"
No, also the Learning Zone . This is where we develop and a good workplace kind of keeps people at that boundary between comfort and stretch . You know do a little bit extra learn a bit more move back into your comfort
No," start developing . So what might we see from someone who 's suffering from stress ? Well , there 's three main areas : emotional , behavioral and physical symptoms . The first one is when someone 's under a"
No," you review this ? I 'M not sure if it 's good enough , they start talking themselves down that lack of selfesteem . But you do see things like withdrawals , day streams and lack of concentration , of inability to focus"
Environment," in terms of Behavioral signs and symptoms . You can see why the health and safety executive might be interested in stress , because all the data shows us that you are more error prone when you are under stress . That means you 're more likely to have"
No," accidents other things that happen . It disturbs your sleep , which means you become more fatigued and more stressed . Your work can diminish in quality . If you um rely on addictive substances such as nicotine , you probably smoke more or if"
No, resources pulled in your body from areas that we might need them like our digestion system . So that 's where indigestion comes in and over time your body actually becomes more ill because it 's trying to either fight or
No," uh model of both mental health and stress , and we start with a situational trigger and that will usually trigger off some thoughts and those thoughts can then influence how we feel how we behave and all of"
No," that links through to physical symptoms . So every morning my boss actually walks past my office to get to his office . If I see that he 's walking in I usually wave and say morning , you can see a situation where , if he just walked past and did n't say anything I"
No," might think to myself what have I done , you know he 's in a mood with me that thought then becomes Some feelings well apprehension and everything that I 've got a meeting with him in an hour or so that I 'm meant to be preparing for that 's not going to go"
Environment," to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions , Misfortune or illness , and it 's incredibly common . We all have some degree of resilience and it 's like a muscle . We can actually exercise it and develop it"
No," and we can develop our own resilience and become much stronger in the face of adversity , and it 's really about this . I'Ve already demonstrated the power of thinking when I was talking about the cognitive behavioral model"
No," which have never happened , and this is this . Trying to fortune tell predict the future that actually we just ca n't do so , it 's about being more rational in our thinking . So back to this cognitive , behavioral model of stress , it 's about really"
No," sounds reasonably positive , but that glass of wine , if that glass wine becomes bottle of wine , it becomes every night that same coping strategy Is now negative and it 's really worth thinking about what you do to cope when things are"
No," engage in Lessons Learned and after action review and work out what I could do better next time ? The latter is actually much more uh , positive and constructive . We need to challenge negative beliefs ."
Environment," That 'S one of the harder exercises I 've ever done , because we do n't normally Pat ourselves on the back , but how we think drives mode and she was right . I was going through a bit of a rough patch at the time and she was able to use my own writing to"
No," mine did and another thing around intelligence is being mindful . Now you may have heard a lot about mindfulness , but simply just sitting and appreciating Where You Are realizing that actually most of the colleagues you work with"
No, you would do so by choice . You know where I work at the moment . I work with a lot of talented individuals and actually just stopping and reflecting on that . That would be one element of mindfulness now . The next petal is about purpose
No," , strengths and values . This is a little bit more difficult because it 's about selfawareness and do we know what our purpose is at work and outside of work . Does that actually align with what you want it to be ?"
No," Something or read a book , that 's something you need to be doing more of the other thing you need to do is understand your values . What is it that drives you and does what you do at work"
No, and outside of work align with those values ? Now this might be a case of you want to get more involved with certain things at work . You might have strengths and not being used .
No," so I actually spent time developing that skill , but knowing your strengths , knowing your purpose and knowing your values and making sure that your life actually aligns with those will make you far more resilient"
No," help somebody out , but take time with your friends , your family , your colleagues nurtured your network , virtually if you Have to after all , we 've all got uh , Zoom or Whatsapp or whatever we can spend time with people"
No," and then the last one is physical energy , because if your body has n't got enough energy , your mind wo n't either stay active . Six thousand steps a day is considered a minimum . Most of us have got mobile phones"
Environment," physical exercise actually helps our state of mind . It releases , dopamine and serotonin work . More is not always more , we should all know about the working time directive . All the working time regulations uh in"
No," now again in terms of managing your physical energy eat . Well , Comfort , food 's great when you need a bit of comfort , but it 's not great every day and do take breaks and that 's breaks away from your work ."
No," station and sleep do not compromise On sleep , seven and a half to eight hours a night every night , if you are not getting that , you are going to massively diminish your physical energy that is available to you . So what now we 've talked about mental"
No," difficult job done on time , especially when I know my clients are really pleased with what I 've done . Yeah , this job 's definitely a lot better than when I was temping . So I will uh stop the presentation here and open this up to any questions ."
No," the first time you always went yeah great thanks . How are you - and he always went ? Are you okay really and you most often times you were n't and then the other thing is that which was a video at the beginning , that we still carry Shame about poor Mental Health"
No," absolutely and when you ask mean it when you actually want to know whether somebody is okay or not ? Okay , let 's move to the question . So the first one is : how can one know whether stress anxiety or depression is genetic , and how do you"
No," overcome this issue ? That 'S quite a big question . Oh dear , there is a lot of research into mental health and there are some uh very big cohorts . Big population studies , um looking at genetics and mental health , and there is almost certainly some time"
No," , but it 's not deterministic it 's probabilistic . It would increase your chances of mental ill health and what I 'll say here is that we do n't tend to take our physical health for granted . So why would we take our mental health"
Environment," Some of these apps , you know headspace , calm things like that . A lot of online resources like mood gym , which is an excellent website which is online CBT , can be used to make our mental health stronger ."
No," So whether you 've got a predisposition or an increased likelihood of having mental health , it does n't mean you have to suffer with poor Mental Health . Foreign . Thank you and I 've got some feedback here . Apologies I had to go , but please"
No," I 'M sure you understand what that means . I do n't I absolutely do if we could , if we could solve mental health uh , the economy would be so much richer . What I would say is that there are simple things you can do in your own workplace um . One of the things that I actually"
No," have just sitting here is my workplace , lanyard um . We have Mental Health First Responders at work and we have about half the rate of mental health . Our mental health related ill health and absence than you would"
Environment," something about it , but I will say , is mild . Moderate exercise has been shown to be as effective as antidepressants in tackling um mild to moderate stress and moderate depression and anxiety . So a bunny actually say it 's as simple"
No," questions tonight . Okay , that 's fine ! So we 've got one last one question and then one um and then Jeff shared what he does , and so there is a resistance from man that mental health is quote poppycock . How can we get buyin from those people"
No," think we just need to make them irrelevant by talking about it . Um things like that mental health pain skill that I shared , and I I will share that with you to to put up on the resources page . So people can use it things like that that make it relatable ."
No," are n't affected by um , chronic illness or mental health problems . Can relate to and what we find is that you 've got to also keep going at it . So my current company , we trained our first group of Mental Health First Responders"
No," and see if you 've lost a piece , that 's a girl , but that 's that 's . I know that feeling myself right , Greg I 'll hand over to you believe . You'Ve got a question for Rosie on The Pain Scale yeah . I did . I think um Rosie answered that one . Thank you very much Julie that"
No," , quote , which again , I think is one that uh uh . I might you know I also it 's funny enough . I do n't know why Julie 's friend to mind when you were talking about having a a hat close to hands to uh um to to strike um ."
No," That was , that was fantastic um and it just just reminds to say thank you all for joining us and attending , and I hope the uh , the rest of your day and the rest of your week is suitably wound , which I think is happy part of"
No," the day particular sounds about what it means . Doesn'T it well ? Thank you so much Rosie for giving up your valuable time and to you Greg and the rest of the London branch committee like to wish everyone a good evening , and we hope to see you at the next London"
No," let's talk about ADL's ADL stands for activities of daily living, and it refers to all the activities that you and I and your care receiver need to practice, and that includes bathing and dressing. Helping out your loved one with ADL's can"
No," Sometimes be a sensitive issue , because sometimes it can make him or her feel exposed , embarrassed or vulnerable if your loved one has dementia , it can also include fear of the activity itself . Therefore , approach your loved one with respect , patience and in a gentle way ."
Environment," Some things to remember are : go easy and do n't rush . Anything create a safe environment . Allow your loved one as much independence as possible . As you stand by gently talk through all of the steps you 're taking and if your loved one has dementia , he or"
No," should be equipped with grab bars , a detachable shower house and a bath chair or bench . These will help prevent , Falls and make bath time a lot easier . For you start the bathing process by gathering together all the personal care supplies you 'll be needing make sure you have a"
No," safe , warm and dry bathroom , remove any objects in the way of your loved ones . Path place a bath mat outside of the tub or shower , and a rubber mat on the tub bottom or shower floor ready to shower when showering your loved one choose warm water and mild"
No," , warm water and with clean washcloths , remove the soap by wiping down the body all the way . Once more , and if you 're really looking for alternatives , you can bypass traditional bathing altogether by choosing from a variety of waterless body , washes and dry shampoos . Now on the"
No," is right after bathing , make sure your loved ones , hands and feet are dry and take time to inspect them , for any irregularities use a nail file regularly to Keep finger and toenails at manageable lengths , but if you must cut cut them straight across with a clipper"
Environment," , then file , the edges down , cuticles can be simply pushed back with a towel . Shaving in general is best done with an electric shaver . Your loved one can use it safely , plus it can provide him or her a measure of Independence . If you must use a safety razor , however , you are the one that"
No," should be doing it and not your loved one . After bathing and grooming , it 's time to get your loved one dressed , keep your loved ones . Wardrobes simple , with easy to manage , pull on clothing and fasteners , using velcro elastic bands or large buttons , lots of zippers and small"
No," are lightweight and do n't tend to slip . Remember that when you 're helping your loved one with bathing dressing , grooming leave plenty of time take plenty of time and if your loved one does n't want to cooperate , just stop take 10 minutes even a whole day and try again"
No," scores between 8 and 11 for the daily living activities , they 'll be awarded the standard rate , if they score 12 or more they 'll be awarded the enhanced rate . This is the sium for the mobility activities . Many people will be awarded the highest score for some"
No," example , Mary scores Phil points when it comes to moving around due to significant hip pain , which increases over time and short distances . Therefore , the activity is not being completed to an acceptable standard in a timely manner , nor can not be completed"
No, Things everyone welcome to today 's webinar occupational therapy strategies for improving daily living independence . It is a pleasure to be together with you all today
No," : i 'm lori shogrin community program and services director for the national ataxia foundation and i 'll be assisting with today 's webinar , along with our communications manager , stephanie lucas . Our speakers today are"
Environment," Welcome marlena hi everyone um , it 's nice to be here today , i 'm just gon na so um as lori said um , i 'm marlena and i 'm also presenting today with jessica , volczynski , we 're presenting on home safety modifications . But we have a couple goals"
Environment," with this presentation . Our objective , our objectives for you today , are to understand how to adapt and modify a home environment um both to increase accessibility and safety"
Environment," , identify accessibility options for your current home environment or modifications you can make identify smart home features as assistive technology and understand universal design Concepts and how to access contractors and"
Environment," financials for that , okay , so starting off what are some barriers and challenges within the home um ? So barriers present themselves , both in the environment and within each person for personspecific challenges . These"
No," might be muscle , joint strain or pain . Muscle weakness , fatigue or endurance level , your balance , when you 're trying to do something um , you can fall both inside and outside of the home ."
No, You could have some difficulty with walking or difficulty with transfers . You could require assistance for activities such as dressing bathing or even something . That 'S a little bit higher level like grocery shopping
Environment, poor low lighting really does come into play . A lot of times so just really making sure that you 're assessing your home environment well um some ways that Talking about the way that you 're doing things and we 'll get into this a little
No," position resulting in an individual landing at a lower level , such as an object , the floor , the ground with or without injury . I really want to touch on the fear of falling"
No," , because this results not only in restricted activity , depression but increased dependency on others and a decrease in social interaction . And we often research often shows that the fear of falling leads to more falls ."
No," And that 's because we have n't , when we have a fear of falling , we adopt the stiffening strategies of movement and that actually um takes away our fluidity of movement and makes us more likely to fall . In fact , studies have found that it"
Environment," increases the likelihood of a fall by 12 times . So that 's our hope is with this . When we can give you strategies to make your home a safer place , that fear of falling will decrease and then risk of falling will decrease . So falls in the environment ."
No, happen in or around the home . I would actually be very interested in the time of covid when we 're spending a ton more time at home to see if this is actually increased and then 40 to 60 of those falls are due to environmental hazards .
Environment," So that actually shows promise to me that if we adapt our environment , we can reduce that 40 to 60 percent and make ourselves and our environment safer . So next we 're going to get into addressing how we can change our environment to make it safer ."
No," instance , placing your bed in a way that allows easy access to the bathroom , especially for frequent trips to the bathroom at night , when we are more likely to fall waking up from sleep ."
Environment," can make there . That is obviously a slippery environment with the water . So it 's another high fall risk environment because it is also cramped . Most most bathrooms are not huge , so"
Environment," changes that you can make to help your safety are installing grab bars at the toilet , sink and shower . The ada does have recommendations for the proper height that you should install these grab bars at and does provide recommendations on that ."
Environment," have rugs in your bathroom rounding corners on bathroom vanities or other bathroom objects to provide safety . I'Ll , never forget . I had a patient one time who fell and hurt her head on the very edge of a vanity"
Environment," , and she made the simple foot modification of going to a home depot or a lowe 's and getting foam and places on those corners so that she no longer had To worry about that safety threat , um , creating a sitting clearance at the"
No," vanity by removing the vanity door and shelves , so this would be under the sink so that you could utilize a wheelchair and roll under the vanity and sit to complete activities . That also helps with energy conservation"
No," , um and the back height is also adjustable in this , and i did a check of the price on this this morning , because insurance most often does n't Cover toileting dressing or bathing equipment , and this was 36"
Environment," , but again the one with the adjustable height , where , if you see my mouse moving , there would be a rod where you can move it up And down is best , this is a toilet safety frame . It does not include a safe or a seat riser in this picture , but it"
No," a wheelchair or doing a stand , pivot transfer with the help of a caregiver , you can more easily transfer in on a certain side . This shows the toilet seat riser , the one that attaches"
No," , doorways , wider , hallways , clear um and i think , with the shift in the open concept , this is definitely shift in the right direction and a lot of 55 and older communities are starting to incorporate This"
No," the tilted mirror is actually coming back in style across the board , but it 's actually has accessibility features . So most of these mirrors you can either tilt up or tilt down . So if you 're sitting down looking it 's a"
Environment," safety monitoring which again would detect fires , gas leaks automatic . Turning on and off of bathroom lights , when getting out of bed , there 's security monitoring and assistance which could detect intruders . So this is like you see , adt"
No," those type of things that monitor entrances , windows , doorways , social interaction , monitoring , i think with covid . We have a lot of this smart home technology that is burst onto the scene now"
No," management tools , lost key indicators . They actually make medication boxes that will set alerts to your phone . If you forget to take your pills at a certain time and even a caregiver can help , you"
No," monitor that , so the alert can go to the caregiver 's phone if you 've forgotten to take your medication and there can even be verbal instructions with these medication boxes or other Tools , so it can say this is the three pills"
Environment," adobe home security . You can pair this with other smart home features like nest , security and nest , thermometer , alexa , google , home and other smart switches up here i have listed with the first bullet point a lot of the hubs and"
Environment," door by the simple click of a button on your phone there 's a smart doorbell . Most of us have heard of ring by now , which is also security , feature the smart thermostats , so nest um , it 's something i use myself"
Environment," at the end , plus there 's a lot of promotion with amazon with alexa , so this is the hub that everything could be connected to , and then this is the nest , thermometer and security camera ."
Environment," this is set to cool at 72 or heat at 72 , but cool at 75 . So that takes a lot of work out of adjusting the thermometer and to the right is a security camera , the little suction cup at the bottom ? It can be placed anywhere . This is also"
Environment," actually it 's a good fall safety device because it will alert somebody if there 's abnormal motion um and , like marlena , said we 're not going to click these youtube videos , but they do give a nice introduction to some of"
Environment, these systems . So uh bode is a wireless home security system that allows you to view cameras and some different features within your home on your smartphone um and the lunesta . A lutron
No," with covid , i know we 're doing a lot more with technology than we were before , even though technology was advancing um looking at how you can use technology without getting too frustrated , hopefully within work school or the even"
No," device support system or your help desk or sign up for classes to understand . The full accessibility features because there are , i always learn new features that um just make it a lot easier and user friendly ."
No," it 's probably a little easier for you to use than you think so - we 'll touch on community resources . Um they 're not easy to acquire , because they are programs that are funded either through the government"
No," and somebody else to help . The third is the us department of housing and urban development . This has various programs for lowincome families and persons with disabilities . As we mentioned , some of these fixes are pretty easy and inexpensive"
Environment," , but some of them are more indepth and more expensive . So it 's nice to know that there is funding um for these and the fourth and last one on this page is accessible customized environments program . This is a program that locates"
No," purchases rehabilitates and modifies homes that have been presold to qualified families . Um of somebody who has a disability , so this is disability , specific and not age , specific , which i feel like is"
No," lower endurance , doing things that you normally do um when you feel weaker that you can you can just tell like . I am definitely weaker than i was six months ago . Um your vision changes if you have double"
No," blurry vision or any jumpiness in your eyes and if you 're um your thinking , skills change at all . So if you have a hard time remembering or paying attention or like thinking through things , you definitely want to ask for a referral there , um and also"
No," , writing eating or typing bathing dressing , getting in and out of chairs cars beds , the shower the tub or the toilet , um cooking cleaning , our laundry , if you normally have to care for children or other family Members , but"
No, challenging for you to do . I would really urge you to ask for an ot referral . Then i also did want to touch on occupational therapy in the time of covid . So telehealth was emerging as a smart
No," say what assistive technology is best and it can help create health , promoting habits and routines . So , for instance , if you were coming to an appointment with us before , and your caregiver was n't able to stay"
No," now , we can see actually how you and your caregiver complete transfers within your home using your own items . So , although sometimes in person is best , there are definite benefits"
No," that if you are doing a home session to make sure you have somebody to help you with the webcam um and also considering doing a trial run with a family member beforehand . As we 've seen , technology can have its problems ."
No," Um , like we were missing a couple pictures so doing that trial run , can help prepare for a telehealth appointment ahead of time and then our last touch point will be financial resources . So with find like thinking about some of"
No," elderly or to individuals with any type of disability , but something that is useful for all of us and really something that i hope moving forward is built into communities and homes ."
No," with like funding or insurance . I believe it 's a couple at least over a hundred dollars . The last time i checked , but what it does is it measures your tremor and does movements to counteract the tremor so that it actually ends up being stable"
No," you - know um or just sitting down because you know uh , that 's just where your comfort is having a tilted mirror down is so helpful . So um , i 'm glad you mentioned that that 's becoming more trendy because , hopefully it 's more of a you know"
No," : um : do you know of any alert systems for when a person falls or needs help that would alert a caregiver or outside system That is appropriate for people with ataxia , who has who have significant coordination issues"
No," too many things , the quality becomes low . For instance , the quality of the fault in the apple watch , um is n't too standard . I would prefer yet . So i think that 's important to keep in mind too , but i 'm hopeful , i 'm glad you brought up"
No," the apple watch because that has been brought up um several times throughout the community and what your thoughts are about the quality of that . So hopefully it does continue to progress to be better quality , because i"
No," think that the idea and um you know the lifesaving tool that it could be , and maybe is um already um so improving on . That would be very helpful to the community , but i think you 're right . I think that"
No," , often good . It 'S good to price match or price control . Online pharmacies often have this equipment because it 's considered durable medical equipment , even though insurance does n't cover it . So it 's listed under online pharmacies ."
Environment," I agree, this is absolutely a case of health and safety and whilst Emily is central to all this we also need to consider all the staff and residents here. You'll see on file that she has shown slight signs of dementia and let's face it she is 94. So the stage 1 criteria for a capacity test have already been met. In which case we move on to stage two and given Karen's observations, I really don't think Emily Look, Frank, I know it was me that started this whole thing off but I was wondering whether there might be another way"
No," Another way? Capacity assessments are a standard procedure, Karen. And given Emily's age and observations of her, we have to conclude that we can't allow to keep making tea for herself every morning Well, I think there is another way. I rang Emily's niece this afternoon. What? Consulting family is standard procedure too, isn't it Frank?"
No," Ok. Her niece told me that this tea thing has become a bit of a ritual apparently all started when her husband Charlie was alive. She'd get up every morning, make a cup of tea then take it to him in bed then they'd sit and talk about everything over the cup of tea. Then when Charlie died she just carried on. Well, it seems to me that for Emily the cup of tea isn't just a cup of tea it's holding on to a memory of"
No," What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy? There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were,"
No," and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20. We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative. But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age"
No," And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II,"
No," and then most went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s."
No," we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, ""You know, it's about time."" So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages"
No," and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others"
No," and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. Highconflict marriages, for example, without much affection,"
No," And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80."
No," And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships,"
No," on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain. And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective,"
No," that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time."
No," Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories. So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and wellbeing,"
No," and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our 75year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials in that recent survey, many of our men when they were starting out as young adults"
No," really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community. So what about you? Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60."
No," What might leaning in to relationships even look like? Well, the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years, because those alltoocommon family feuds"
No," for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that."" The good life is built with good relationships. Thank you."
No," All right , what 's up guys , my name is Sean . Welcome to the channel . I wanted to make a short video specifically about all the physical symptoms related to anxiety , really give you an explanation and really help . You understand why physical symptoms happen when you 're struggling"
No," with anxiety , because here 's the truth most people think anxiety , is just all in your head right . It 'S like ! Oh , it 's like I 'm nervous before an exam . You know , or I 'm feeling nervous before , giving this video , but anxiety is so much more than just being in the head . It 'S also very"
No," physical , it 's mental and physical , because it 's focused on one thing , which is survival now . What this means is people who are struggling with physical symptoms that just get labeled as they as anxiety by their doctors and so on and so forth . They have a really hard"
No," time , understanding what 's going on , how do they identify what 's really anxiety or what 's an actual physical symptom , they the line kind of gets blurred a little bit . That 'S what I want to talk about this video . I really want you to understand how to identify first and"
No," foremost whether a symptom is anxiety or whether it 's something serious and by the way , it 's really easy to do , and then , furthermore , I want to give an explanation : why does this happen ? Why do physical symptoms happen ? Why are these symptoms that literally make you think"
No," as well so pay attention . So what happens is that these physical symptoms that seem so scary is so easily misinterpreted as something actually serious . So what typically happens is individuals who struggle with anxiety , specifically those that struggle with"
No," happens is that they end up going to their doctors and they run a series of tests and the doctors say : hey you 're , fine , it 's just anxiety , almost kind of like casting it aside , almost making it sound like it 's in their head . But that 's not the truth . The good"
No," separate things during this time . Some people are like okay , cool , it 's anxiety , but how do I get out of this or somebody just disbelieves their doctor ? It just feels like it 's untrue . Maybe they miss something , and so that 's when they go into the Google 4 , that 's when they go"
No," googling their symptoms . That 'S when they go on forums , that 's where they start getting assurances . They just ca n't figure it out because there 's a fundamental misunderstanding about anxiety as a whole . So what I want to talk about is why do physical symptoms"
No," happen when you 're struggling with anxiety , now , there 's a lot of forces at play and it 's kind of a complicated answer , but I 'm it essentially boils down to this fundamental mechanism . This mechanism is called the fightorflight response . Now it 's important . You"
No," understand this mechanism because look if you do n't understand , what 's happening , you 're , not gon na be able to focus on recovery because think about it like , if you do n't know , what 's happening . Every heart palpitation is gon na feel like a heart attack every but breathlessness"
No," palpitations and it scares you and you feel like you 're gon na - Have a heart attack well you 're , responding in fear now what that tells that fightorflight mechanism , that innate part of your brain , that that reptilian part , is that hey you"
No," aspirin . Oh I 'm a little stressed me have a glass of wine . If I 'm anxious , let me take this : no that 's not how anxiety works . In fact , anytime , you try to take something to make the anxiety go away . You'Re kind of giving it that register that hey something 's up , hey Shawn"
No," , does n't want to feel this way . There 'S probably a perceived threat , so every symptom , every physical symptom , heart , palpitations , dizziness , nausea , vertigo , digestive issues , even things like even derealization , depersonalization brain fog , I mean the symptom like numbness"
No," you have that 's a good sign , that means it 's anxiety . That actually means it 's fixable , and the great news is is that the key to recovery is in your hands . It 'S not in some supplement . It 'S not in some mantra : it 's not in some breathing technique ."
No," It 'S not even in this video recovery is within you , there 's just a few things . You need to do right now that hopefully helps you understand the mechanics of anxiety , but well now , if you kind of have a good idea of why you have these symptoms and you have a good , solid"
No, answer and you believe it and you know it 's anxiety now : It 'S about focusing on the solution and the solution takes a little bit of time . It takes practice . It 'S not like you just learn something or you do something once and it goes away . It 'S normally three steps forward
No," Considering downloading - and I hope that helps now - the last thing I 'm gon na say - and I say this all the time which is , if you were just if you 're serious , about overcoming these physical symptoms , going back to living , no longer having anxiety being a crutch . No longer making this a"
No," life sentence , you have to change your approach to a certain degree and what I mean by that is most of the time when we 're anxious . We want it to go away right now . Naturally , I mean it 's not it 's not somebody who struggles with anxiety , it 's"
No," not their fault . Anxiety is very uncomfortable . It 'S designed to make you do something immediately , but here 's the problem anytime . You do something immediately to make your anxiety go away and never goes away . You need to change your approach . You need to change your"
No," from now three months from now a year from now or a different person , you need to focus on That it 's very hard to do when you 're struggling with anxiety , and so , if you 're , trying to figure this out - and you feel like anxiety - is such a lonely road , it 's difficult ! Nobody"
No," important that you answer those three questions , the best , your ability , here 's the thing anxiety forums - can get kind of toxic . If you 've ever been on them . You can you know what I 'm talking about where there 's a lot of story topping a lot of"
No," of the group . We do n't want this to be another Facebook group , where or any group that where people are just story topping each other fear mongering . Everyone goes on these forums only to feel worse . This is really more of an educational thing where , if you 've gotten"
No," , everything ruled out from your doctor and you 're trying to focus on overcoming , not coping , definitely join this group we 're being very selective on who we ad . So it 's very important that you answer those three questions . The best your ability , that being said , I hope you guys"
No," What 'S up guys welcome back to the channel , my name is Sheri Jones . Today , we 're gon na be talking about my physical symptoms of anxiety , the ones that I went through the most common ones , very terrifying , a scary situation , very painful as well . Okay , but now I 'm happy"
No," that I 'm on the other side , so I can share these with you and basically relate with you guys . So , if you 're ready to kick anxiety into butt , smash the like button down below and leave me a comment . Today 'S question of the day , what type of music do you like to listen to when"
No," you 're dealing with anxiety ? If you want to name some artists , that 's cool too . You know what I mean : you 're , helping other people find some cool music , giving them . Maybe a peace of mind whenever they 're going through anxiety or dealing with some of these symptoms , I 'm gon na mention ."
No," just my personal preference um , I was dealing with anxiety so guys , if you answer that question down below you , have a chance to get a shout out I 'll , be picking two people I have to shoutouts to give today for those of you that actually answer . Yesterday . Okay , drumroll"
No," information that you can share can help some of the other of you , so guys we 're going to jump right into this . I dealt with anxiety for five long years . Okay , I had five to ten panic attacks a day . I was always in fight or flight mode . It seemed like . Obviously , I"
No," would have some moments where it was extreme and then I would have some crashing periods as well , but I was always revved up okay and has caused a lot of freakin symptoms . I dealt with health anxiety , so I mistook these symptoms for horrible illnesses and"
No, diseases . I was a hypochondriac fullon . Eventually this led to be dealing with social anxiety . I started to push people away . I was ashamed of my condition . I did n't seek help so I dealt with this for five years . All right . It was tough on me in every
No," aspect of my life , but yeah . Let 'S jump right into this again . I have experienced many more symptoms than this , but these are the main ones that I dealt with on a daily basis . The first one is chest pain . Now this is extremely scary . I know many of you are dealing with chest pain . I"
No," would have every type of chest pain that you could imagine . Okay , I would have squeezing pain . I would have sharp pain , shooting pains that would come out of nowhere . I would have pains sometimes that would be on the left side . Sometimes it would actually be in the middle , which"
No," I would fear the most and then I would have chest pain on the right side . I would have it just below okay , my lower part of my sternum , and then I would have it up high . I really did n't have any areas that did n't experience , pain and this is brought on by muscle tension . Not"
No," only did this really hurt bad whenever I was having panic attacks , it was the first part of my body that would tighten up because our fightorflight mode causes a lot of muscle tension , but afterwards it would stay tight and if it was n't super tight , it was Just sore from"
No," out . It did n't help . My fear out having this constant chest . Pain was unbelievable to me . It did n't make me believe the doctors whenever they would run tests and told me I was fine , because this pain was actually happening and guys these symptoms feel real because"
No," they are real . Okay , so do n't just think that you 're just making this stuff up in your head . Okay , the tension really is there . These things ca n't hurt . Okay , the next one is palpitations . My heart would just shoot all out of nowhere Bam , Bam , Bam , Bam , Bam , Bam , Bam , Bam , Bam . Now , my"
No," resting heart rate guys just to put this into perspective . Well , it 's usually anywhere from like 95 to 115 . That was at rest , so I 'm not talking about being asleep just at rest . Throughout the day , whenever I 'm just chilling on the couch - that 's really fast for even resting , but"
No," whenever I would have anxiety and panic attacks , my heart rate would jump up anywhere from 150 160 , all the way up to like 180 ish , all right , super freaking fast . I 'M sure he got above that I just did n't have anything to measure it , so I was always paranoid about my pulse"
No, pass away or something you know what I mean like I was . I could n't fathom that anxiety could do these things and that 's what just kept me in prison . This was not being able to accept that anxiety could actually cause these symptoms . It was mindblowing to me so my my blood
No," seen me before and they 're like geez . You have some high blood pressure , but I have anxiety . But what do you mean ? Do you think I have heart ? You know I mean it was just a very . It was a very weird situation . Okay , the next one was numbness and tingling . Now this definitely did not"
No," help me with my fear of having a heart attack , because I associated my left arm going Nam and tingling with having a heart attack . That was one of those symptoms that I initially searched . When I had my first panic attack - and it 's stuck with me - okay , so I would often"
No," focus my pain focus . My numbness focus my tingling on the left side of my body , because that was the side that I feared the most yes . I do believe that you could actually focus more pain in certain areas by concentrating on it , okay and that 's what I would do"
No, feet and extremities could be dealing with that as well . So this is something that terrified me . There was also times where I was fearing a stroke . There were times where I would fear that I had MS or ALS and neurological issue
No," some issues with my nerves , so this is a very scary symptom . I know how many of you are going through this , but if you 've been checked out by a doctor and you 've been told that it 's anxiety , that 's how anxiety can actually cause that the next one"
No," IBS symptoms now , there 's a ton of things involved . With this I already had issues of my stomach and digestive system before I had anxiety , so you better believe that it really aggravated this . For me , it was terrifying . I mean terrifying . It was just a horrible"
No," experience . Okay , I would have diarrhea all the time if I had a panic attack . Diarrhea would follow right after so imagine being terrified that you 're dying from a heart attack , and then you have to run to the toilet and have an explosion . I know it 's like too much"
No," churning also then . On the contrary , I would deal with constipation a lot , some things that I would deal with as well . Bloating gas there 's more gas being produced down there . So , whenever you 're dealing with anxiety , that production goes up also a lot of trapped air from"
No," shallow rapid breathing stomach , cramps and pains as well see digestion is no longer a priority whenever you enter into that fightorflight , so blood supply gets shut off there , causing a lot Of these symptoms , so a lot of you that are dealing with this thing to realize"
No," would wake up in the first three hours of my day I had horrible amounts of gas just built up in my stomach and it took like 34 hours for it to kind of go away , and I Was every single freaking day so a lot of pain there ? The next one is a muscle , pain and I 'll go ahead and throw"
No, back Payne in there as well . An incredible amount of muscle . Tension is taking place whenever you 're stressed out or whenever you 're highly anxious . Even people they do n't have a disorder per se or if you 're walking around with tension like
No," you 're so tense . You have knots , you know things like that think about how much tension you have whenever here in fightorflight mode . Do you think your muscles are just chill and relaxed no you 're again trying to run away or fight off something whenever"
No," you are in fightorflight mode ? So do you think your muscles are gon na be chillin , know they 're gon na be tight , they 're gon na be tits . That way you can fight getaway spring into action . So again , that 's what led to my chest pain , but I 'm telling you I would deal with"
No," pains everywhere . My legs would hurt it 's crazy and that 's that are wondering like what 's wrong , good blood clots . Is there something wrong with my legs ? Am i withering away ? I would have jelly wobbly legs , sometimes not live things up , but just I did n't have the strength"
Environment," anymore , and it was because I was tired . Basically , I was running like a marathon all day long . You know just tons of things going on like that and the back pain . Oh my god , man . I remember I was about 21 and I was like you know what I 'm gon na go exercise . I 'M gon na try to"
No," get a hold of this and I go and I did n't do any stretching . I do n't take any precautions . I was n't hydrating myself at the time which hydration can help a lot with these muscle pains and eggs , and I went to go jump . Rope and three jumps in"
No, your anxiety in general to make this a lot better . So the muscle pains are terrible . I would feel these burning sensations in my back whenever I would walk around at work or whenever I would sit a certain way . I almost felt like somebody was putting a
No," cigarette out on my back . That 'S how much of a burning sensation sensation excuse me that I would feel so . The back pain was really bad . Also I 'll . Add to that whenever I would wake up in the morning , my back would hurt tremendously . It was like sleeping on a horrible mattress ."
No," That 'S how bad it hurt in the morning , because I would still have a lot of this muscle tension at night . Whatever I was trying to sleep , the next one is headaches and a lot of you have these . I would probably have headaches a few times a week . Now , if you suffer from"
No," headaches or migraines or anything like that , and did you have anxiety , of course it can make it a lot . You know much much worse . My mom would deal with migraine . I felt so bad for her . So anxiety would n't help her out now . The headaches for me believe it or not . You can still"
No," experience muscle tension in your head and in your neck areas , so it could still lead to pressure and headaches . So if you 're dealing with that , there 's no explanation from your doctor . You'Ve been checked out and , yes , anxiety can lead to that as well . I would have every type of"
No," headache I would have radiating pounding tension . A lot of people described it as like a band being around their head , a tight band . I would deal with that as well , so pressure headaches and I would have sharpen shooting ones as well . So of course , I 'm thinking brain aneurysm , I 'm"
No," thinking of a stroke or something horrible or a tumor , and then many of you that have helped anxiety . That 'S some of your first conclusions as well . The next one is actually a big one . I should have put it higher up on the list and that 's short of breath again . If you 're trying"
No," to fight off something or run away , do you think you 're gon na be taking long , deep , breaths , no you 're gon na be shallow , breathing rapid , breathing all right , so shortness of breath is n't very , very common . Also , everything is just tight in general , it 's gon na make you feel like"
No," we are extra sensitive . You know what I mean if you , if you 're dealing with health anxiety , especially you 're extra sensitive and aware I did a video on this yesterday , very very focused in on our body and in tune with it . So these things feel so much more bigger than"
No," what they actually are , and that was kind of one of those things and I feel like until I got over that fear of lymphoma and I moved on and started to trust the doctors and trust myself and stopped Going back for reassurance all the time . Finally , my focus went somewhere else and"
No," then the pain gradually went away . You know , whereas if I had lymphoma it would never go away or would get much much worse , but I would definitely deal with ear pressure into ringing . In my ears it was miserable , so it just made me feel like"
No," brain tumor , you type in those two things it 's gon na pop up . So , that 's why you do n't Google something else I had to start doing was just stay away from Google and stop self checking . It helped a lot so guys if you 're going through any of these symptoms . My tips for"
No," anxiety are down below it all starts with accepting anxiety and then not focusing on your symptoms , because it 's impossible to recover guys if you are focusing on your symptoms or your negative thoughts . Alright , these things diminish . If you divert your focus to"
No," something else , that 's how I did it so guys . I love you all . Keep fighting remember to leave me a comment down below answer the question of the day . What type of music do you listen to to help with your anxiety ? You can name some music artists down there as well like"
No," this video . If you got value guys if you 're interested in anxiety , coaching oneonone , my NEEMO is down below in the description in , and the first bin comment hit me up and we will set up our session . I love doing it , so many people are getting great results ."
No," I 'D love for you to be a part of that . Also , my social media , my Instagram , my Twitter , my snapchat and the Facebook group is down below join those social networks , so you can be a part of that community as well subscribe if you have n't hit the notification bells and"
No, Feeling short of breath from time to time is healthy and normal . It 'S a natural response when your body needs more oxygen and energy when you do something requiring effort . The reason for breathlessness is that
No," the flow of oxygenrich air into the lungs breathlessness , is n't just a physical symptom . It 'S also a feeling that affects the way we think and act . If breathless , you can feel very hot panicky or overwhelmed , or that your"
No," anxious that anxiety or fear can increase how breathless you feel . As we get more anxious , we may become more aware of our breathing and then breathe faster and tenser breathing muscles , and this can often lead to a panic attack ."
No," If you have breathlessness , you experience , shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing , the medical term for shortness of breath is dyspnea . There are two main types sudden onset breathlessness is when you get out of breath"
No," sudden shortness of breath and your chest feels tight or heavy . You have pain that spreads to your arms back neck and jaw , or you feel sick or being sick . These things"
No," could mean that you 're having a heart attack or a serious problem with your lungs or airways , persistent breathlessness , is shortness of breath that persists beyond a month , usually due to a chronic condition like"
No, copd or heart failure . You should see your gp if you have shortness of breath and it 's lasted longer than a month or it 's worse with activity or when you lie down or you 've been coughing for more than three weeks or you have swollen
No, ankles . These could indicate various different types of chronic diseases and they need to be checked out . There are loads of different causes of shortness of breath when we talk about sudden onset or acute shortness of
No," breath , we 're thinking of flareups of lung problems like asthma , pneumonia , covid19 and copd . This is a blood clot that can occur in the lungs , usually after a clot . In the leg or after immobility or surgery , heart"
No," failure can cause excess fluid to build up in the lungs and ankles causing shortness of breath . Anxiety causes , shortness of breath , feelings of panic and palpitations and other causes like pain , anemia and some medications can even"
No," cause it . Some causes of persistent breathlessness are similar to the sudden onset causes like lung conditions , asthma and copd and heart conditions like heart failure . These are all long term conditions that"
No," can usually be managed , but sometimes they get worse and flare up and become acute . Are you in need of immediate medical attention , flareups of asthma , copd and heart failure make up a lot of what goes to a e and what we see in clinic two other"
No," persistent causes of breathlessness include things like heart rhythm problems like atrial fibrillation , where the heart Is less efficient and less oxygen is being pumped around the body , so you need to breathe faster"
No, to get more oxygen . This rapid breathing makes you feel breathless or anemia having less hemoglobin through blood loss is common in those with heavy menstrual periods and causes tiredness and breathlessness . Even obesity and a lack of fitness can
No," cause persistent breathlessness . So what happens in clinic in this day and age ? A lot of medical conditions can be managed remotely and over the phone with breathlessness , though it would be rare for us to not want to see you on"
No, the same day to examine and see you in person . We want to know more details about the breathlessness like how it started quickly or slowly and did anything trigger it . How far can you walk before getting breathless ?
No," Do you have any other symptoms like cough weight , loss or fever ? This may indicate a chronic infection like tb . Have you traveled abroad recently or had surgery ? This can sometimes relate to a clot in the lungs . We often grade your breathlessness using"
No," a scoring system to assess the severity . It looks a bit like this with a score of one associated with no difficulty in breathing and a score of six , which is breathlessness at rest , with varying degrees in between this helps us to quantify the degree of breathlessness"
No, or refer you to either a lung or heart doctor routinely for further investigations . Treatment depends on whether the breathlessness is acute or chronic . How severe it is and what the likely cause is
No," , such as your reliever inhaler . If you 're asthmatic or a rescue pack of medications , if you have copd , if you have ongoing breathlessness , there are a host of modifications that you can make to breathing . That can really help your daytoday quality of"
No," life , including things like breathing techniques , postural modifications and lifestyle changes for more information on this check . The link in the description below sudden onset shortness of breath could"
No," be a medical emergency , seek urgent help . If you have severe symptoms , breathlessness can be sudden onset or you can have had it for a long time or an episode of sudden worsening shortness of breath . With someone who has long term problems"
No," , the main causes are due to lung disease , heart disease , anemia or a panic attack for sudden onset shortness of breath . You will always need medical assistance and the treatment is dependent on the cause for chronic shortness of breath . Breathing positional"
No, and lifestyle changes can make a big difference to how shortness of breath affects your life . Many thanks for listening till next time stay healthy
No," Hi my name 's Sanjay Gupta and i 'm a cardiologist and I working in York today . I thought I 'd do a little video on how to try and work out whether your breathlessness could be due to a problem with the heart or not . The first thing to say is that breathlessness is a very common symptom and it 's also very nonspecific symptoms . When someone complains of breathlessness , it could mean a variety of different things . They could just be very unfit , a person could be overweight and they may not realize that they put on weight and that 's caused some breathlessness"
No," in some who have become breathless . You know , as people get older , they do n't actually realize and when they take on some kind of physical activity , but they have n't done for a little while they noticed breathlessness , and these are obviously do n't signify a major problem at all . Then there are other causes of breathlessness , predominantly the lungs that if you have a problem , your lungs and that certainly could cause breathlessness and that 's more of a concern in people who are a heavy smokers or people who have a history of ashma people . Who'Ve been exposed to asbestos"
No," and I suppose , if you are getting breathless , then it is very important . You at least have a chest xray , because if there 's a problem , the lungs that most of the times that there could be a chest , xray can give you some clues . As to whether or not it is due to the lungs , the next step would be to simply have some lung function . Tests and in a small percentage of people . Breathlessness could be due to small clots going up to the lung , in which case a CT scan"
No," of the chest would question that question from a heart perspective , though , there are two main things . The first is the reason people get breathlessness because of problems with the heart is the heart is not able to pump out enough blood and if the heart is n't able to pump out enough blood , then there 's less oxygen that goes round and that causes breathlessness . So the first thing to say is that you want to know whether your heart is actually structurally healthy or not as it is , whilst you 're at rest is the heart structurally normal or not , and the way that"
No," way one works . That out is firstly to have an ECG and , secondly , to have an echocardiogram . What does the echocardiogram tell you ? The echocardiogram tells you , if you have a nice strong heart , if it 's pumping at rest , if it 's pumping adequately at rest , pumping enough to be able to pump enough blood out commensurate with the bodies requirements , it will also tell you the scan will tell you if you Have a problem with any of your hearts valves a lot of the times . A heart valve"
Environment," problem is suspected when a doctor hears a murmer in a patient 's complaining of breathlessness , but sometimes you do n't hear a murmer and therefore , if you are getting breathless , then undoubtedly it is important to have a heart scan . It 'S also worth saying that it is very , very , very rare for someone to get breathless at rest and not be breathless at exercise . So if you are getting that , then almost certainly there that does not signify a major problem with the heart heart . Problems are usually worse . On exercise , then at rest , so if you have a normal heart scan and it shows that your heart is"
Environment," actually functionally normal and it 's pumping warmly , what is the other way that you could get breathless if the heart is n't getting enough blood when you say start walking , So at on exercise when the heart is n't getting blood and that would obviously cause the heart not to pump as well , and that would make someone breathless and that 's usually , that usually happens if the heart arteries , the heart arteries that take blood to the heart , are narrowed . Ie angina , so a lot of people associated angina with chest"
No," discomfort , but in a few cases they could be the only symptom , maybe of breathlessness . So I suppose , if you are getting breathless , the first thing to try and work out is : is it at rest or is it on exertion ? If it is at rest and not on exertion , then it almost certainly does n't major major problem with the heart . If it is on exertion , then certainly i think you definitely need an ECG and a heart scan , and if your heart scan is normal , then your doctor will need to do a provocative tests . Ie get the heart beating faster to see if it 's getting"
No," all the blood it needs to keep working , and that can be done by putting you on the treadmill by doing something called the stress , echocardiogram or even something called a myocardial perfusion scan . Now , when the heart is weak at rest , that condition is called heart failure . Ie , the heart is failing to keep up with the bodies requirements , and that is usually something that we would suspect in people who have had a previous heart attack and therefore have a damaged heart or in people who have been born with a heart problem ."
Environment," Congenital heart disease , the other thing to be aware of in people with heart failure . Is they get other symptoms ? They get exercise intolerance , they get breathless , they get very tired and they often complain that swelling of the legs swelling of the ankles . They find that they often have to sleep with more pillows than normal because they get more breathless if they are lieing flat in that setting . That 'S very suggestible of heart failure and its really important to get checked out . So , yes - and I suppose , that 's about it really"
No," for this tutorial for this video , if you have any concerns , if you think it 's always worth getting checked out , if you would like to know more about me what I do and if you 'd like more information about heart Health and heart matters then feel free to visit my website . Alternatively , you could give me a ring on the phone number if you would like to get checked by cardiologists . I would be delighted to do so . I think I just want to wish you goodnight and thank you very much for listening . I hope this is useful . Bye"
No," Dyspnea is shortness of breath. It's a very common symptom in a lot of illnesses and conditions. People think of COPD or interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension, but it can also go along with conditions like heart failure and cancers. And really there can be so much suffering that goes along with the shortness of breath. It causes anxiety and depression, and dependence on others for help around the house and doing errands and and it just can make people feel so terrible."
No," What amazes me about a lot of patients I meet with advanced lung disease is how accustomed many of them become to the limitations of their breathing. Some of them become very used to walking ten feet and stopping and resting. And it they at least tell me sometimes that it doesn't bother them and some people it does bother. So really it's taking a very personal, very patientfocused approach to how does it affect them and how do we help make it better?"
No, Let 'S talk about copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . What does this word mean ? It means that there 's a lung disease that takes a bit of time to develop . That 'S the word . Chronic obstructive
No, means you 're not able to breathe to a certain degree . Another name for copd is emphysema . Some of the symptoms - there 's quite a few . The most common ones are shortness of breath . Coughing mucus the problem with copd is
No," it 's a progressive condition that eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension , so you 're getting blood pressure ? That 'S going up in your lungs and it 's going to put a lot of stress on the right ventricle . That 'S the right"
No," Okay , normally they look like this . When you have copd , they look like this , so you lose the shape of these little pouches , because there 's a tremendous amount of irritation from either smoke or some other"
No," , so it acts sort of like a carburetor . The carburetor is the lung of your engine , where you 're actually pulling in oxygen , mixing it with fuel with the right ratio . A little spark plug and creating energy , so the problem with"
No, copd is this : chronic irritation creates inflammation in something called oxidation and oxidation is basically it 's like a rusting out effect of your your body tissue and the more
No," not oxygen . It 'S just kind of like this other thing : that 's going to irritate your lungs greatly . In summary , that 's what copd is now . What can you do about ? It there 's some really interesting research on this"
No," , and it has to do with this right here , oxidation at the heart of copd you 're , getting a massive amount of oxidation . There just happens to be an antioxidant that can help stop this , maybe even reverse it . Some of the"
No," you 're , reducing scar on the skin ? Well , why not just take it internally to reduce scarring too , not just in your lungs , but also in the liver . There 'S some great data on cirrhosis , but you can also use it on copd to help"
No, break down some of the scarring in the lungs next remedy is vitamin d3 . I would venture to say that a hundred percent of patients with copd are severely deficient in vitamin d. You have a lot of receptors for vitamin d in
No," the lung . One of the treatments for copd is steroids . Okay , like prednisone and other and other types of steroids that are like bronchosteroid inhalers , because steroids are antiinflammatory"
No," to help , recycle and break that down and use that as energy and through its recycling brand new tissue , so fastening will help the lungs in various ways , dropping inflammation and actually correcting some of this damage through"
No," , all right . What is the other problem with copd ? Usually , people develop it from smoking and sometimes they are still smoking , even though they 've been diagnosed with this condition . So it 's very very difficult for certain"
No," people to give up smoking 100 because of its addictive qualities , and it 's mainly from this chemical called nicotine , which i want to talk about now . Nicotine is interesting because it stimulates a part of the nervous"
No," on this thing right here . So unless you continually take in this nicotine , your stress level goes up . You might get slightly irritable , you might get angry , you might have depression , it can really affect your uh . Your brain , nicotine also stimulates adrenaline"
No," go down . Also , if you take a look at the withdrawal symptoms of nicotine , you have increased stress , nervous , anxiety and grouchiness or anger , and things like that"
No," respiratory history , making sure that you 're aware of all the questions to ask for patient coming in with a cough shortness of breath . Wheeze and that most distressing of all chest pain , respiratory symptoms are common and I think that 's one of the reasons we 've"
No," decided to go down this respiratory route , because kovat is putting a loss of respiratory symptoms on our screens , whether or not you 're reading about somebody having A cough on Twitter or someone who 's worried about wheezes that they might be experiencing is this kovat"
No," , so we want to make sure that everybody 's understanding , the vocabulary and what we need to ask with regard to the history on those conditions or those symptoms . So , let 's start off with a cough which can occasionally be called ptosis . So I 'm gon na put this one to you guys and the"
No," cat has done his first intervention here and I do n't know if you can see but has just appeared on the kitchen table bust off . So what is a cough ? I 'M gon na pass that one over to you guys to start with . So how would you define a cough , so we 've got quick multiplechoice there on the"
No," question . Do you think that a cough is a rapid single , noisy breath , a forced expulsion of air producing mucus ? A reflex action to reduced oxygenation or a forced exhalation against the glottis , with subsequent powerful release of air from the lungs and , finally , an audible"
No," , involuntary response to irritation of the Airways . So hopefully , you 've got dealer as the answer of that being a cough is a forced expulsion against a closed glottis to release air from the lungs okay , and I think , probably a lot of you have seen"
No," so just to consolidate a little bit of that a cough . It 'S there to aid the clearance of the lungs . Now , if we wanting to cough up mucus , if we wanted to cough up , you know particles of salt or dust that we 've sprayed up with inhaled it 's a protective reflex . You know so think"
No," You'Ve brought down into your whim pipes . The problem , though , is that the causes of a cough are legion . Okay , so this is the symptom , but we need to understand . What 'S underlying it and in order to help the patient , we need to treat that underlying cause and not the symptom . That 'S one of"
No," the reasons why I 'm sure you 've all found when you 've been unwell , you 've tried some cough syrup and it 's mildly , effective , because it 's not actually treating what 's causing the cough in the first place . Okay , here 's a lovely mucky one for you , sputum wheat sputum , is"
No," and bacteria or viruses or any debris that the lungs have managed to collect during infectious period . And as a result of that , when you 're talking to a patient , if they say that the sputum , what they cough up , has changed from normal"
No," know thin and clear , as most people would ? Hopefully have sputum or is it thick and gloopy ? As you might see in someone , that 's got chronic lung disease . We need to develop the volume . So how much does the patient coffer ? Is it just , you know a teaspoon full well and they occasionally"
No," cough or could they be producing copious quantities of fluid , and you know that you know a teacup full rather than a teaspoon ? Well , you know we 're British serve all of our measuring systems over here based around teeth , and the third thing would want to know about the"
No," you an idea roughly what might be going on . As I said , if it 's clear that it was , you know , gon na be normal for most people . Similarly white , if it 's the yellow , we 're thinking , we 've got a lower respiratory tract infection . If it 's green , then we can be certain that we 've got an"
No," worrying symptom until we have ruled out all other causes for this . So when I say we need to rule out all other nasty causes , it 's actually not uncommon to cough up blood in a normal , common or garden respiratory tract infection . If you think about it , you know you 're"
No," , coughing , you 're , hacking , you 've got this constant cough you 're . Putting all this pressure every time you do a cough , it 's not going to be too alarmed to have somebody rupture , very small blood vessel without coughing , and you see that in the sputum , but because a pulmonary , embolism"
No," or lung cancer of possible causes , we can never assume A benign cause of hemoptysis until all the other serious issues have been excluded . When patient comes in and says doctor I 've coughed up blood , you know am i dying . The first thing we need to do is obviously get"
No," harder to vomit blood than it is to potentially cough up blood . As I say , it 's not unusual with a respiratory tract infection , but in terms of vomiting blood . That 'S that 's not good . What about lettuce , taxes ? What about a nosebleed ? It 'S the patient , actually had"
No," plenty of blood coming out of their nose and they 've got a small amount . That 'S trickled down the back of their nose into the throat which , with our cough being a protective reflex , they 've then brought up . As we 've talked about with sputum , we want to know how"
No," much the patients are bringing forth . Are we just talking about little streaks in the sputum , in which case I 'm automatically going to start thinking , so how much so how much blood are we talking about ? Are we talking about little streaks in"
No," the sputum , in which case we 're going to think that this is more likely to be an infectious problem ? Are we talking about copious amounts of fresh frank blood , in which case we might be worried about something like TB , or maybe lung cancer , or perhaps on the more benign side of"
No," associated with chest pain , particularly when the Patient breathes in suggesting a heretic pain . Is this actually a pulmonary embolism ? Is there a blood clot somewhere that 's causing to bring forth some blood ? If there 's large volumes of it again , could this be a vasculitis ?"
No," , so got ta pass it on straight back to you . What is dis Nina ? Can you give me a definition for this before we go for words ? So is dis , name , shortness of breath , a type chest ? Is it a respiratory rate greater than 15 breaths a minute ?"
Environment," Is it a subjective discomfort to breathing ? Is it poor , oxygenation or a reduced exercise ? Tolerance , so hopefully you got that one at home that shortness of breath , if this knee is a subjective , discomfort and breathing , and that subjectiveness"
No," its own doctor can you help me . I feel really short of breath is a very difficult one to work up , and one of the reasons that we may get people coming and presenting with shortness of breath is it 's a hugely influential symptom on affecting a patient 's activities of"
No," daily living . Just try and put yourself in the position of the patient for a moment in living a grand life life is good for you and then suddenly you notice that you ca n't run quite as far as you used to give it a week or two , and you know Just doing the shopping is more"
No," that can bring forth shots of breath , that being issues of awareness , so is it that the person is now more aware of their breathing so anxiety , it 's like a social issues could be an underlying cause . There is it something to do with the work of breathing ."
No," harder for them to take a breath , I say : there 's a cornucopia of issues there then we 've got a ventilation problem . So pneumonia is there actually a problem with the squeegee bit of the lungs : can ? Is the patient having a problem getting an oxygen transfer from the air in the"
No," , we need to really dial into the history to try and tease out what could be going on . One of the first questions we want to know is : how did this short of breath ? How did this dis near start ? Is it something that 's only come on last week when they started to get a cough or something it 's"
No," been getting progressively worse over the last year ? That timeframe is going to focus your mind to chronic issues or acute . What 'S the effect at rest , that 's a very good way of identifying how severe the problem is right from the getgo . Do they only get"
No," the shortness of breath when they 're exercising or are they short of breath sat down and that shortness of breath at rest is going to be really concerning to me ? What 'S the effect at night now so with that we want to know , is it affecting the patient sleep ? How are they"
No," sleeping and a very useful question is how many pillows are they using at night ? So if the patient , who normally sleeps with one pillow but now they 're having to prop themselves up so they 're sleeping with three we 're going to want to know when that changed happened"
No," well now ? That might give you a very vague answer , but it also may give you crucial information that they were fine until they fell over a week or two ago , and since then their shortness of breath has worsened it . So could it be that that patient has actually fractured a rib and"
Environment," is caused a pneumothorax ? Perhaps when does the breathlessness come on , so I 've asked if they have an effect when they 're at rest ? But if not , does it come after a set amount of exercise ? Does it come on if they 're worried if they 're anxious , if they 're frightened , does it"
No," come on only when they lie down , tell us about that variability and do they have any other symptoms that might be connected to it ? Do they have a temperature ? Have they got a cough ? Have there been bringing things up is ruies , so I 'm"
Environment," putting together really a nice picture in my head . This patient might have a chest infection or saying that they 're short of breath it 's worse when they lie down . They'Ve noticed that their exercise , tolerance has reduced and actually they 've also"
No," can use in terms of a scale to highlight how bad to quantify , how bad that patient shortness of breath is ? Of course it 's a loaded question , so we can quantify the subjective by using the MRC breathless scale . Hopefully everybody is great one , we 're not troubled by breathlessness"
Environment," , except on strenuous exercise as breathlessness worsens , then we go to grade two you 're short of breath when hurrying on the level or of a slight hill grade , three will be walking slower than most people on the level Or stopping after a mile officer or 15"
No," daily living . Okay , here 's a really good one , wheeze or polyphonic breathing . Personally , I find that patients use this term incorrectly , sometimes whether using it to you know mean that they 've got a a prolonged cough or the herring . You know something when they 're getting short of"
Environment," , so a wheeze is defined as a polyphonic noise or sound of breathing , but due to turbulent airflow in the narrowed Airways . Yes , sometimes that can happen due to respiratory secretions , but it is not what we 're meaning in the technical sense . Here a wheeze is mainly expiratory"
No," narrowing of the large Airways rather than small , which would see with expiratory wheezes . It can be caused by compression a tumor or you know , a foreign body . Getting stuck in again the large Airways . The reason why this is so important is it must have a rapid"
No," assessment to find out , what 's going on and should be considered to be a medical emergency in that regard . If you think about that , you know in terms of a foreign body and why this is a medical emergency , you have a child at home , you know there hail a small toy or something"
Environment," like that and it lodges in the airway . Then we 're going to get that that in spiritually wheeze and if you think about it , I 'm sure that some of you may have heard that noise before it 's just somehow so alarming by comparison to a regular wheeze . And I can not highlight"
Environment," enough the need to get this assessed because there 's something serious going on here . Okay , we talked about always the timing or associated factors can give us a lot of the information moving towards our diagnosis . So does it happen during exercise which might simply be in an"
Environment," exercise induced asthma ? Does it happen after exercise where we might be talking about COPD or not related to exercise at all , which could be straightforward , asthma in a very severe there ? Does it disturb the patient 's sleep ? So one of the questions"
No," that we want to know when we 're doing as much X is : does their asthma affect their sleep and that wheeze at night is going to be a major feature of asthma ? Can you think why are we ? Is why asthma might be worse at night ? Well , if you think about it , the natural steroid of the body"
No," cortisol decreases most at night , so unnatural inflammatory system and disappears so we 're more likely to get a worsening of any narrowing that were that is present worsening . Louise potentially worsening the cough of asthma and waking , the patient from sleep"
No," does the week 's get affected by allergies ? So maybe not necessarily asthma . But is this an a topic individual with a dust , allergy or a hay fever ? Is it worse on waking which we might see with COPD , or is it improved with expectations of coughing of large amount of sputum"
No," smoker , so maybe we 're talking COPD and again , all they finally produce large quantities of sputum , which would once more get us thinking down that bronchiectasis route . I hope you can see that there 's this interplay between asthma , COPD and bronchiectasis as the"
No, sort of three main tentpole diseases of respiratory medicine . Now here 's a big one chest pain and hopefully you could see that it 's going to cross multiple specialities . Is it a cardiac related chest pain ? Is this respira chest pain is to musculoskeletal chest pain ? Is it
No," potentially gastro too ? Can chest pain if we 're talking about issues with the esophagus and stomach so like a cough , the causes of chest pain can be legion , so we need to try and narrow down what 's going on in our history , so to come to you guys , first with the question , So"
No," , which is the false statement here , pleuritic chest pain is worse on inspiration . Chest pain can not originate from the lung parenchyma . The squidgy bit rib fractures are only painful on expiration , malignancy pain , wakes , a patient from sleep and a pneumothorax"
No," causes pleuritic chest pain . Okay , hopefully you all got that that rib fractures are painful on expiration and inspiration . The crucial thing to remember about fractures is that the pain of fracture is due to movement . So that 's why putting someone in a plaster"
No," of Paris immobilizing a broken limb is the best form of pain relief . You can give them . Hence why rib fractures are so very , very painful , because every time you breathe in or out you get the movement of the fracture and you get the pain . I'Ve personally been knocked off my bike ."
No," I can also tell you I went to work that day and it was a little bit harder to get a sick note out of me than normal that day , so moving rapidly on went to our chest pain , so we want to deploy our squit as mnemonic . What 'S the site of the pain ? What 'S the quality of"
No," the pain ? What 'S the intensity , the timing do we have any aggravating features and what other symptoms are associate with the chest pain such as relieving factors , do n't close your differential too early on when you 're dealing with a patient with chest pain , it 's very easy"
No," close things Too early remember , it could be musculoskeletal respiratory cardiac and gastro the big specialties too , to quickly narrow down . So , let 's look at the p2 start off with a PE can cause chest pain from when you breathe in . It can also cause shortness of breath and"
Environment," here 's the crucial bit it can cause an angina type pain where the patient is experiencing increase in chest pain with increasing exercise which makes people think it 's a cardiac . But if you have n't gotten the rest of the history about that pleuritic chest pain , pain when"
No," they 're breathing in we might think that the patient was dealing with a cardiac issue rather than our respiratory problem . So with that in mind , let 's talk about pleuritic chest pain for a minute . We'Ve mentioned this several times so pleuritic , chest pain happens when you"
No," straightforward pneumonia again with inflammation , and that may rub up against the side of the chest cavity , causing pleurisy . Where we 've got irritation , the pleura that 's causing to give really painful breathing . You could have a pneumothorax . You know that you 've had a"
No," of pain to patient sleepiness . That might be an odd one for a spiritual aperture . Why not a patient talk about being tired and we connected to respiratory things so sleepiness or excess daytime sleepiness specifically , can indicate a problem with the"
No," patient 's sleep at night . Well , I mean you know that does n't exactly sound like a complicated assumption there , the reason being from our spiritual perspectives that it could be a problem with obstructive sleep apnea . So the patient goes to sleep , for whatever reason they"
No," have some obstruction to their Airways . That causes apneic episodes superior , the patient , stops breathing and that might have that causes a micro arousal they wake from sleep . Thus they do n't have what 's called refreshed sleep , so we 've got any patient coming in saying doctor"
No," feeling really sleep , you 're , I 'm so tired . During the day . We want to find out what are their normal sleeping hours . So if they 're , you know sleeping two hours a night because they 're working on their university project well , duh ! That 'S why you 're tired ! We have a simple answer"
No," move on , however , if they 're getting 1012 hours sleep and they still shattered , we need to you know , dig into this a little bit more , perhaps they 're doing shifts or night work . Maybe this is a problem with their sleep cycle , so they 've built up a"
No," sleep debt and even though they 're sleeping large amounts of time , it 's not good quality , sleep and they 're not being able to cover that . Maybe they 're lacking refreshing sleep and we go back to that concept of sleep apnea with the microwaves and you know : do they struggle"
No," it is . This sleeping is so severe but its effect they 're struggling to stay awake during the day . So here 's a question for you : when we talk about sleepiness and respiratory patients , we have something called the F worth sleep score to work"
No," out how severe things is so , which is not a factor on the Epworth sleep score , falling asleep in the car falling asleep driving A car falling asleep during the concert conversation falling asleep watching TV or falling asleep during a plane flight . So those all look quite"
No," simple , but hopefully you 've got that falling asleep on the plane flight is n't a problematic thing , I 'm sure there 's a couple of you will have actually ticked the box saying that falling asleep when you 're driving would n't be part of the Apple sleep score , Because it seems to be"
Environment," so extreme , but actually it is and if you 're getting a patient , that 's falling asleep . Once they 're sat at the traffic lights , that 's going to be a major safety factor as a result . If we 're worried about sleep apnea and we 've got a sufficiently high F with sleep score"
No," , then we must have patients stopping driving . Whilst we come to a formal diagnosis which will need a respiratory specialist to do and or we get a treatment in place so frequent little sleep , apnea will give people a breathing mask a CPAP mask at night to help force"
No," airway into their lungs , overcoming any obstructions . So they get a much better sleep and patients can frequently be . You know they really not keen on having a CPAP mask and then they find how it revolutionizes their life and how much better they feel actually having been"
No," able to sleep through the night . What we 're talking about the history ? I'Ve got a point there . It 'S always worthwhile paying attention to what the partner is saying , because a patient might not be aware that they 're having these microwaves so ask the partner . They"
No," notice that the patient stops breathing at night period of time and similarly , the partner is very important here in terms of treating or modifying risk factors for sleep apnea , because we 've got things like obesity , smoking and heart failure ."
No," So heart failure is something that we can look to treat obesity . We can help people lose weight and smoking . We can help people modify their lifestyle to , hopefully improve or potentially you know completely treats their sleep apnea . Unfortunately , we 're not going to be able"
No," to treat someone 's age or the fact that they 're male those are n't nonmodifiable risk factors for our sleep apnea . Well , there we go . Hopefully this has given you a good background to the history . Taking that you 'd need to dig into a patient with a"
No," as quickly as you can . I hope you 've found some benefit here , but I 'm sure a couple of who thinking ? Why have n't we done more talk about the examination of the respiratory system ? Well , I 'm glad you asked because we 're doing that next time in the same way that Elsevier has given"
No," Welcome to I Am Your Target Demographic. In our continuing series on world religions, we turn our sights now to Buddhism. This a superficial video, meant to explain to nonBuddhist viewers what this religion entails and what they believe. Let’s start at the beginning. Buddhism can be a complicated religion to explain in terms of history for a few reasons. It’s incredibly old, originating somewhere in the range of 500 years BCE, or Before Common Era."
No," Even before this though, Buddhism has roots in a variety of belief sets that parallel what is now known as Jainism, which I may eventually cover in another video. At the time, India put its main focus on tradition, based on texts called the Vedas, which were ancient Sanskrit texts which informed their beliefs and made up a foundation for the Hinduism faith. There was a bit of division, as a man named Siddhartha Gautama began to teach a shift from this normal way of being, based on discipline and abstaining from indulgences. See, he was a bit sheltered, and as he discovered more about the world, he began to teach on"
No," He was later given the title of Gautama Buddha, though Buddha is a title that many other people have been given, many times long after they’ve passed. Before we dive into these eight practices to achieve enlightenment, let’s zoom out at look at the four core beliefs of Buddhism, called the Four Noble Truths , which Siddhartha discovered as he began to see more about the real world outside of his sheltered life. The first truth is that suffering exists, it is birth, it is aging, it is illness and death. Pain is everywhere."
No," The second truth acknowledges the origin of this pain, that there is a craving for this pain, such as craving for sensual pleasures, craving material goods, we desire even though we know it is painful. The third truth is the end of suffering, it is that this craving can be stopped and you can be free from it. The fourth truth is how to be rid of this suffering, which points to the noble eightfold path, the eight practices that can help to end this cycle of pain and suffering."
No," Let’s look at what these eight practices are in the Eightfold Path. It begins with the Right View, meaning that our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and there are consequences after death. Buddhism focuses on a cycle of rebirth, called samsara. This cycle of rebirth is painful, which is why people want to eventually earn liberation from the cycle. They believe this reincarnation might put you into another human body or perhaps an"
No," animal or even a spirit, there are many ways you might return to this Earth. The second practice is the Right Resolve, to give up the world and live your life in dedication to following this path. You should focus on loving others, abstinence from sensuality, and a life of compassion. The third practice is Right Speech. Don’t lie, don’t be rude, no gossiping. Right Conduct means not to injure or kill others, not taking what’s not yours, and"
No," Right Mindfulness follows. Not only preemptively stop negative thoughts, but focus on what you are thinking. Be always aware of your thoughts and actions, try to be aware of reality and your own impermanence. The eighth practice is Right Concentration, or called Right Samadhi, is a culmination of the other traits. You have lived your life morally, been in the right mindset, able to stop negative thoughts and focus fully, resulting in a very powerful state of meditation."
No," By acknowledging the four noble truths and following the eightfold path, there is a state called nirvana, which results in the end of your constant rebirth and the pain that comes with it. Now, nirvana is going to be difficult to explain, because when you achieve nirvana, is the extinction of your physical life, so there’s no one that has experienced it that can really explain it to you. And even Buddhists often disagree with what attaining nirvana means and looks like, so you might run across different definitions. I’m going to introduce a term here called Bodhisattva, which is someone who has nearly"
No," enlightenment and how to achieve it. For a long time, these lessons were oral tradition, meaning they were just passed on by spoken word, until people started to transcribe his lessons almost 400 years later. Because of this lack of written text, Buddha’s personal life and even what years he lived, are constantly debated. His lessons originally centered out of India and what is now Nepal, though Buddhism has spread across the world."
No," Interestingly, Buddhism has actually declined in India, only .7% of the population. There are countries however where Buddhism is the national religion, such as Cambodia and Thailand, where over 90% of its residents are Buddhist. By pure number, the most Buddhists reside in China, with over 185 million, but that’s only 16% of China’s total population. Buddhism is also the primary religion in Tibet, or the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China. This Tibetan Buddhism has evolved and changed a bit from other forms of Buddhism, influenced"
No," by the religions in that region before Buddhism spread there. Now, let me talk about a figure you probably know something of, the Dalai Lama. In Tibet, the Dalai Lama is the head of one of its schools of Tibetan Buddhism and is a symbol for unifying the Tibetan region. It’s an old tradition, started in the early 1400s. The people of Tibet believe that an ancient bodhisattva named Avalokitesvara is reincarnated and acts a benevolent watcher over Tibet."
No," For context, Avalokitsevara is one of these bodhisattvas that held back enlightenment to help others, and is now believed to be reincarnated, looking out for those suffering in this world and returns to help alleviate this pain. As of this video’s creation, the fourteenth Dalai Lama is Tenzin Gyatso, a religious name given to him once he took the mantle. Since they believe this is reincarnation, when a Dalai Lama dies, they begin to seek out his replacement, usually relying on visions or clues to tell them where the child is."
No," So that is just a short summary, again, it’s very superficial. This is meant for people who maybe don’t know anything to get an idea what they believe in. It doesn’t cover the nuance of how they perform these practices, the complicated nuances between various branches of Buddhism, or all the various terms and positions included in the religion. If you found this interesting, check out some of my other videos on religions and let me know what other religions you’d like to see me explain. Thanks for watching!"
No," Nene individuals Are come out to the house to meet them before the kheer starts and the go through the Social Work care plan and then Alaska , Morrie 's Montana , and this own individual care plan . It 'S all Pearson st. art , so the way that it reads to the caters from near"

No," most occasions practically all the team that has the keys sometimes will have an accident which takes up more time for the girls to get mom Clean achi , but on the whole half hours enough time , for we are n't , know running five minutes late due to the last client they 're , taking a"

No, happy every day is a school day . Were always learning and we 've got the opportunity to do great things ? I absolutely love it . I 'M really passionate it 's not a job and if anybody who 's working in care just sees this strictly as it 's a job . It 'S it 's it 's a career
No," Good morning , everybody thank you for joining us today . Welcome to today 's webinar activities of daily living tips and tricks for the caregiver , my name is Brook Phillips from the marketing manager at Shield healthcare . Just a few housekeeping items before we get started"
Environment, be Barbara West with capital nursing education . Barbara received her master 's of nursing at Yale University in 1993 . Her wound ostomy continent certification from Emory University in 2011 . Barbara has 12 years experience in hospice and her
No," , Barbara . It 'S all yours hi good morning . Brooke . Thank you for that kind . Introduction , welcome everybody to activities of daily living tips and tricks for the caregiver , I 'm so glad you could join us this morning ."
No," team number . One on the team is the person who 's needing help with activities of daily living . We might call them the patient our loved one , a care receiver . Then we have the caregivers , family , friends , hired caregivers , nurses , aides , occupational therapists or OTS"
No," physical therapists or pts and speech therapists . I want you to be familiar with those three abbreviations , OTS , pts and STS , because those are your key helpers when it comes to activities of daily living . I 'M going to be presenting a lot of"
No," information today , but that none of that replaces the personalized care you can get one on one . When you 're dealing with one of these therapists to our our key players for activities of daily living , an ADL is the abbreviation I 'll . Be using today ADL 's means activities of daily"
No," benefits , longterm care , insurance or even home health intake . So if your home health nurse is going to come out in a few days , do n't improve all your activities of daily living before you get signed up , I 'm going to be talking about something called an oasis score"
No," conditions or progressive conditions , and so that can really be a struggle . We often do n't see them improving in their ability to do activities of daily living . In an intrinsic way , so a lot of this presentation is going to be about workarounds . What can we do to change the"
Environment," environment to make it more workable for them ? How can we change our own behavior and expectations so that they can be more independent ? The official list from the Medicare Oasis , dataset activities of daily living we 've got grooming dressing , the upper"
No," and lower body . Those are areas where OTS and pts are most helpful . Grooming , particularly ot 's for lowerbody bathing and toileting . Both OTS and pts have a lot of important input . Transferring and ambulating that 's really PT 's area of expertise and eating both OTS and STS"
No," new technology . So since this program is targeted towards the caregiver , I 'm going to assume most of you folks are dealing with folks who have some degree of cognitive impairment . As well as physical disability is the condition stable or is it temporary ? Is it reversible ? Is it"
Environment," time , we 're going to focus on non bed bound patients today and we 're going to talk about the tradeoff between safety and health and privacy or independence . So , as a professional , I 'm obligated to tell people what I think is they try to prevent them from falling , but a lot of"
No," working as a history , professor and soon after the diagnosis he did have to quit his job and over the first couple years he was getting more withdrawn and depressed and his family knew how much he wanted to contribute being a teacher . So they set him up with a tape . Recorder"
No, giving us a rare glimpse from the patient 's side of it . What is it like to struggle with activities of daily living ? So I know for those of us on the caregiver side . Sometimes we just think why are they being so difficult ? Why does it have to be this hard ? So I think it
No," guess I 'll someday have to write a book about that which is exactly what I 'm trying to do . Sometimes there is a feeling of guilt for having Alzheimer 's . I should have known better , maybe I 'm no damn good you 're worthless . You ca n't hack it every day is absolutely separate"
Environment," accessible within the home ? Can you move your bedroom to the first floor , so you do n't have to go up and down stairs if you have to leave your home , there are many different levels of supported environments , some provide meals , some provide personal assistance , medication"
Environment," assistance and then you can get full 24Hour care at a skilled nursing facility . Sometimes we can stay in our original home environment , but we just need to change the caregiver situation or change the individual caregiver may be just getting intermittent help with"
No, the housework yard work . Cooking bathing specific personal care is going to be enough . Maybe we need to increase the caregiving . We already have have another family member come in and help a couple days a week to give our main caregiver a break . Maybe we have some friends out
No, there . That would be eager to help if we just ask them or maybe it 's time to hire help . Sometimes we just need a different person . Family ca n't always do jobs that a non family member could do more easily . One lady wrote about when she was caring for her mother with Alzheimer 's . She
No," realized that a caregiver in uniform was the key somebody showing up was not a family member dressed in a uniform , helped her mother to feel safe and she responded . Better was less combative and things went smoothly . Sometimes it 's a personality issue just because it"
No," does n't work out does n't mean there 's something wrong with the caregiver or care receiver . It 'S just the way , their personalities do n't do or do n't mix . It can often help to have an experienced caregiver , especially someone who 's , taken care of somebody with your same medical"
No," condition , and then sometimes we just need someone with more physical strength . There are a lot of health factors that can indirectly affect ADL 's both for the care receiver and the caregiver , starting with psychological factors . Denial is a huge issue if you 're not admitting that"
No," you need help it 's hard to ask , for it is hard to receive it pain and can dramatically affect ADL 's , and I want to tell a story when I was a hospice nurse consulting at a dementia unit . There was this lovely woman in her 90s . She was mostly bed bound at the time I met her . I"
No, was n't opening her eyes or talking or interacting much . I think she was n't feeding herself . She had a history of arthritis and just watching her in the bed . I thought you know what I think she 's hurting a little bit . She did n't have any obvious signs of pain . She was
No," herself and that 's just with Tylenol around clock . So it shows you what a huge impact pain can have on our ability to function , even when someone 's not showing signs of it . Depression is a big issue , we 'll go into in a couple slides here , anxiety"
No," , substance , abuse both on the part of the care , receiver or caregiver , is going to affect our ability to get activities of daily living done same with insomnia if you 're not sleeping at night , if They'Re not sleeping at night , our adls are are down the tubes . Cardiovascular status can"
No," affect fatigue , anemia to be another factor there with cardiovascular status , leg , swelling or edema is a huge issue if your legs are really swollen . That 'S like having several gallons of water strapped to your legs . Imagine how hard it is to walk like that . We'Re going to talk about"
Environment," exercise more obesity , it 's not something ! That 'S easy to resolve in a short run , but something to think about , because our ability to perform these activities goes down when we 're carrying those extra pounds , whether its water or fat being on the right medications , can make us more"
No," active . On the other hand , medication side effects can impair , impair our ability to do ADL 's . So we need to look at medicines from both sides and underlying infection is a common cause of inability to perform ADL 's depression . I 'M not going to go into all these details here ."
No," There are things online : how to look for the signs of depression and we have different types and causes for depression . Some are more or less responsive to medication and do n't underestimate the value of social activities , spiritual support , home"
Environment," visitors , change of environment exercise , here 's a long list of all the benefits of exercise . You'Re , probably familiar with . Most of these do n't forget how exercise improves sleep ? Remember we were talking about insomnia a couple minutes ago . More exercise for both the care"
Environment," , receiver and caregiver during the day could solve that insomnia problem on a tell a little story . It 'S never too late to exercise . My hospice patient George was up in his 80s . He had progressive cancer , just a wonderful inspiring guy and he"
Environment," him doing chinups on his trapeze there in the hospital bed and that improved his day . It also kept up his arm strength , so he could turn himself better in bed . So George is showing us it 's never too late to exercise we 're going to talk about environmental modifications . Again"
Environment," , you know unless we 're the amazing physical therapist or occupational therapist . We often ca n't help people to literally function better , but we can change the environment , so it 's more workable for them um . But I want to caution folks if you 're caring for"
Environment," the little yellow pill . If you 've got better light , it improves safety because you 're less likely to trip over unseen objects your ability to do ADL in your mood so talking about depression . A couple slides ago , improving the lighting could help with your depression"
Environment," down and do the pet suit . That way , and if you look online , there 's a whole host of safety devices that you can install . If it 's the right time frame in the bathroom again , we can spend a lot of money making modifications , but there are also some simple things we can do . A"
No," recurring . There are bidet attachments , toilet seat , attachments that spray water up from inside . The toilet and for you guys in home health back to to improve your toileting hygiene score . Just by having these different tools available , the bathroom can be a dangerous place , so"
Environment," cushioning the corners of sinks with foam pipe insulation can make it a lot safer . Other tips for the bathroom nods , nonskid , mats and decals of these basic safety issues . One thing I had n't thought about was wallmounted soap dispensers or even toothpaste , dispensers , sometimes"
No," so much sense to me , because activities of daily living are so personal , it 's so individual , and so here I am presenting to all of you with These lists , but to really solve these problems it takes knowing the person they 're in , do seem proceed in their history . We'Ve"
No, home are often our key players . Those are the ones that are helping people with ADL 's and also teaching family and other caregivers how to how to perform them . I want to tell a little story about Fay . She was an aide who worked at a nursing home . We had a lot of dementia patients
Environment," there . I was the consulting hospice nurse and Fay was just amazing . I mean I think she was a genius . She was very physically fit . She worked out at the gym . She really took care of herself in her own health . She just got people on a deep level , she would get to know different patients and"
No, having to look at do I need to move or not . Sometimes we do just need a higher level of care or that better match between patients and caregivers social workers can help . You sort those issues out . What tasks can you offload
Environment," if the shampoo a couple times a week is a big battle needle you can just go to a hairdresser to get it done there , that change of environment may be uplifting help combat depression as well . If nail care is a problem , let 's go to a nail salon : go to a podiatrist um . Can we"
No," of trying to squeeze that bang tube and talk to your dental hygienist brushing someone else 's teeth can be different than brushing your own teeth and a dental hygienist is A great resource for that I want to read you a quote from the caregiver by Erin Altera , who was the"
No," primary caregiver for his wife with dementia he 's talking about his wife Stella here as she looked at the brush and toothpaste as objects for which there was No known use , I put taste on the brush and place the handle in her hand . I might as well have handed her a"
No," touched to her teeth by somebody else else . Eventually , she forgot brushing all together and the ater . I did it for her . This is a great example of how that continuity , the site into the person being willing to try different things and remembering"
No," what does or does n't work passing on the tips to other caregivers who are involved to make all the difference and as with progressive conditions . You know when we have a victory like this : it 's not going to last forever , but a year of good brushing like that . Just"
Environment," think of all the exercise she got for her arm muscles by doing that , good , brushing you guys in home health for your oasis score , an intervention like that could move you from a 2 to a 1 or even a zero if everything 's already set up correctly In the bathroom there 's"
No, pace is a key to folks being able to do these ADL 's on their own . More here 's some more kind of a review of bathing we 're going through that oasis data set in order . We talked about most of these already in our environmental modification section
No," fancy , but a regular bathtub and two legs sit in and the other two legs are out in the main part of the bathroom . So you can just sit on it and scooch over without having to climb into the tub daily . Bathing is not necessary for most people and for some folks that do n't sweat too"
No," to take a bath when they 're , energetic but still relaxed , plan plenty of time get things laid out ahead of time , regulate the air and water temperature again bathing can be frightening and we know folks function better when they 're In their comfort zone"
No," example of not getting into it with the person . So often we can start butting heads and we do n't want to end up there dad your bath water is ready . I do n't need a bath here . Is your towel now unbutton your shirt , his mind may focus on the buttons . Instead of the argument , I"
No," bathwater . As long as it is here , why not take a bath ? It would be terrible to waste it and the bath could go ahead without any argument , because we did n't want to waste the bathwater . Now we 're moving on to toileting , and I first want to talk about environmental incontinence ."
No," outline the toilet bowl rim . One family drain their toilet and use fingernail polish to paint a target inside the toilet bowl and it worked . If none of these work a rubber floor , mat can make cleanup easier , um , here 's a bunch of toileting tips , I 'm not going to go"
No," working on your oasis score in home health . You know , switching from regular briefs to pullups could improve your toileting score from a three to a two or maybe even a zero , because it 's so much easier to manage a pullup brief . It is a tape up brief urinary"
No," incontinence . These are all the kinds of things that an incontinence provider would go through with you . Fecal incontinence , in particular , is one of the most common reasons why family members are no longer able to provide care at home . It 'S important to not feel guilty"
No," if you 're overwhelmed by feelings of disgust . Some folks can provide care for incontinent folks and some ca n't , but sometimes we can manage fecal incontinence pretty easily just by treating constipation or diarrhea or having somebody have time to sit on the"
No," toilet . At a regular time of day , a lot of folks can be continent of formed stool , but they are not continent of liquid or loose stools . So if we can normalize the stool texture , they could be continent again . So the BRAT diet , bananas , rights , applesauce toasts . A lot of you 've heard"
No," of that or a low residue diet is a more detailed version of that . You can find that online . A lot of folks of us are tending to eat highfiber because we know that 's good for us , but if you 're trying to slow down and thickens dual output , a low fiber diet or a low residue"
No," diet to be the key and then there 's many other tips . For folks , with fecal incontinence , even folks that are paralyzed from the waist down , like my girl , was from the car accident , my 19 year old or with neurogenic bowel , can be Taunton it with a bowel regimen"
Environment," can replace that individualized assessment assessing the person who 's struggling with ADL 's , as well as their environment , to see what Equipment is needed , tips for safe transferring again . These are best taught in person while you 're actually doing it"
Environment," body mechanics to move somebody much bigger than them safely , and we , when we talk about safety and transferring we mean for the caregiver as well As the care receiver patient , transferring is one of the most hazardous things for those of us who are caregiving , so we"
Environment," want to be mindful of safety for both parties . Okay , here we have Terry Henderson , I think he 's getting in or out of his living room . Chair and he says , if you 're going to get Alzheimer 's by all means , pick out a good caregiver as they call these people . Like my wonderful wife"
No, on most of the time . I love how he in the toddler just kind of looking at each other here and that 's what 's so precious about these pictures . The way he 's able to maintain contact with his family during this time and other folks receive that kind of human connection in a
No," , I did stop going to church the biggest reason . Well , there were two reasons , one of which I am not really enamored of a God who creates something like Alzheimer 's and the second is I 'm afraid of tripping . I 'M scared to death of climbing stairs , mainly because my feet"
No, do n't go exactly where I want where they want to go . Alzheimer 'S kills a lot of instincts . You once had . I get nervous on anything that 's higher than a few inches . That 'S one of my Bugaboos . I 'M scared to death of going down stairs and it 's not
Environment," when people do n't have foot pain , you 'd , be surprised how much better they can walk again . Controlling swelling in the legs can be a key factor for improving ambulation , whether you 're controlling it with diuretic medications or compression stockings environment may be the key to"
No," success here . Um , here 's a little story about ambulating again from Aaron Altera , who wrote the caregiver . There was something I figured out . It did not last long , but it was something one day I urged Stella on with dum dum de dum dum . In a moment"
No, that children use when they 're learning to use eating utensils plan for a mess have plenty of towels and washcloths close by and a bib . You can enjoy the meal without worrying about how long it 's going to take you to clean it . All up here are some examples of tools you
No," situations , as the digestive tract is slowing down it 's normal to eat less and have less of an appetite , and we can actually make people ill by forcing them to eat . But in the case of the caregiver by Erin Altera , his wife wanted to eat , she was hungry"
No, for a minute about IADL . These are more advanced activities that most folks who qualify for home health probably are not able to do . But Carrie Henderson has some choice : words here and there 's an amazing story in the book about him trying to open a can of dog food when his wife is
No," should be out making money , or I should help people more . I just feel so darn useless at times . Sometimes . I think it must be very hard on the caregivers too , very very hard , because some of us me , for example , can be very , very stubborn . We want things to be like they used to be"
Environment," helping us , so this is a list of household tasks and activities that folks can enjoy , who might be struggling with ADL 's and doing these activities could increase their dexterity and exercise and help them do the more practical activities we 've been talking"
No," admit that their memory is poor . If that 's the case , you can say you know , I forget things too , and these are some tricks we can use to help . Us all remember , take care of your own needs and feelings recognize when you are overwhelmed . Your loved one may be"
Environment," partial , all right , but what wo n't be partial ? With your C E credit , you should get an hour of C credit for those of you in home , health or other certifications , and we 've got our email here for capital , nursing education be sure to check your spam folder .

No," kind of questions we have coming in here . I do see one on caregiver burnout . Do you have any advice on how to avoid caregiver burnout ? Barbara yeah , caregiver burnout is a huge issue and asking for help is the key and for a lot of us who are caregiving types , that 's the hardest"
No," thing for us . Us to do we are a lot of us are independent kind of proud people . We want to solve our problems ourselves if you 're going to avoid caregiver burnout . The key is asking for help , so that could mean joining a support group . There general support groups for caregivers"
No," asking for professional help , of course make sure you 've got . You know the OT PT ST all . Those resources can help make life easier for you , as well as your loved one , but you 're probably also going to ask to ask for help from family from friends"
No," we can get away or so we can take a vacation . I'Ve been talking about continuity , a lot throughout this presentation and if we 're the one caring for our mom , of course , we 're the most able to provide the continuity , but there 's a tradeoff to that . You need a"
No," give up continuity for our own health and wellbeing and then do n't overlook if you have any spiritual beliefs , if you 're connected to a church or a synagogue or a mosque reach out to those people , there 's more help available than what you realize And yeah asking for"
No," help is the key , and sometimes we need to see a therapist . We need particular mental or physical health care for ourselves . A lot of caregivers neglect that oh and then there may come a point where you ca n't do it anymore , and then you have to recognize that the burnout"
No," online and I 'm sorry I did n't think to do that , but also your local physical therapist can help you solve that question as well . Okay , great and we 'll go ahead and see if we can find some information and post it to our community site when we post the recorded"
No," You know their size and body size and shape because you got to get the tension just right . You know you 've got to get it snug enough , that 's not going to slide , but you do n't want to over squeeze somebody . So it 's it 's a fine point , but when you get a gait belt working right"
Environment," , you know how to use it . It can make all the difference for safety for both of you and make you both able to do a lot more activities . So I 'm just sorry . I am NOT the expert on that . Okay , great , thank you . We do have a question we 'll just be available to view again in a later time"
No," , so we can share with coworkers that were not able to attend . Yes , this webinar is being recorded . We will go ahead and post it to the community site later this afternoon , us shield healthcare , shield , healthcare , comm , slash community and we 'll post it in the caregiver section"
No, that you all have very busy schedules and we appreciate your time . So thank you for joining us today and I have a great rest of your day thanks so much Brooke and thank you everybody for attending all right . Thank you
No, So activities of daily living adls there are some things to do so have a look at your modules . The things that we 're going to get out of this lecture is the ropan logan and tierney . Adl model is really what the whole lecture is based around .
No," that influence everything within our lives and by that these impact on the middle activities of daily living and there 's 12 of them now to be healthy . We need to be able to in some form or another , be able to"
No," see here that physical health is just one thing , but things such as expressing sexuality dying sleeping i mean okay breathing is probably important there , but there 's lots of different facets of"
No," that cause me to be a healthy human , but it does n't mean i have to be fully independent to be healthy . So an example of that is , my wife is also a nurse and when we met she used to work in a spinal unit in sydney"
Environment," be touching on these very briefly , but if you obviously want to get a little bit more understanding , then you would have to look at These individually so maintaining a safe environment - i 'm"
Environment," not going to bang on about this , because when i was listening to peter ann , i think she she mentioned a lot about maintaining a safe environment such as sanitation , pollution control . Now this is probably one thing that when i was a student , i used to always think"
Environment," environment , we ca n't really add on uh care to our patients . Because if i think about my 10 year old at home - and i say , can you go and clean your room and he 's like oh yeah , it 's cleaned , but i have to step over lots of washing"
Environment," to get into his room . I 'M like i 'm not really sure this is my ideal of clean , so we ca n't look after people in an unhealthy environment . If you have to walk over equipment , then just imagine you 're you 're patient with dementia who 's had a stroke"
No," medication for the very first time in placement , make sure you take the time just try and think . Well , if that was my mum , what would i want someone to do to make sure that they 're not going to overdose her"
No," or underdosa ? So she 's going to be lying in the bed in pain , so make sure that you 're thinking about these things , not just from the patient 's point of view . But how can you make sure that you are assisting them in"
Environment," every factor of their activities of daily living ? So developmental age factors , so we 've already mentioned when it comes to maintaining a safe environment . If we have a baby , they clearly ca n't"
Environment," maintain a safe environment . What in in hospital is a a real issue with with babies in hospitals and maintaining a safe environment . From my experience , the biggest issue and remember"
Environment," we 're looking at maintaining a safe environment , it kind of relates to lots of different people when people come in and this can be related to peed . It can be related to different families ."
No," The family think : well , i 'm not going to do anything , because this is n't my home . This is yours as a nurse , so i 'm not going to do anything and the real little things they forget to do , but , as a nurse , you think that 's okay , mum 's there she 's going to do it ."
No," The amount of times that we 've had babies left in a cot with the side down while mum 's gone out to have a cigarette , because the mum said , oh , i did n't know , i was allowed to put the rails up on the bed , but obviously , as a nurse , you Think , well"
Environment, is n't that common sense you 've left your baby in a bed you 're going to put the the sides up . So remember that when it comes to you as a nurse simple things like patient education are really important as well .
Environment," to help you create a safe environment , but your es bar your isobar , whatever you 're going to Use in the hospital is actually really really important , because you 're handing over quite vital things from one nurse to another nurse . If you"
Environment," obviously thought it was hilarious that yeah , i 'm never gon na feel that now , whilst , whilst that was n't a safety issue , because you know , thankfully i did the right thing - um just missing something really small , because we want to go Home can have"
Environment," Thankfully , that does n't happen anymore . If you 're ever worried about your patient make a met , call press the button safety education , so it says safety , education for staff , but , like i said , safety , education for your patients is very important as well"
No, so communication who thinks they 're a good communicator . I really found this difficult because we 're not talking about your ability to communicate um with your friend or your ability to communicate on facebook .
No," there and thinking , i need to say something i should probably say something now . This may be the longest time i 've gone without saying anything . So it 's good to have those kind of pocket of verbal responses that you can"
No," I know how you must feel now , if you 're ever going to say that to anyone , you want to make sure that you can back it up with something . If someone has come in their child has broken their legs . That visibly upset the parents are just going out of"
No," their mind . I can see how you feel really so your child has broken their leg recently and you 've been in bits , um um . Now you can point things out and say i can see you 're upset . Is there anything i can do do n't ever ever say that kind of , and we"
No," do that , i think with our friends all the time . Oh yeah , i understand yeah are completely yeah totes yeah . It 'S really easy to just say to our friends just because you know they 're our friends , oh yeah , yeah , oh yeah"
No, you as a nurse try not to tip them over the edge other things with this as well . Now i found myself doing this to my wife . The one thing i found so as well as the words we 're using as well as the tone that we 're using
No," now i said to my wife . I was really cranky with her the other day and she came up to me and said so , so are you going to tell me ? Are you going to tell me what i said what what did i say that was so bad and the words that came out of my mouth"
No," , and you might have the best will in the world to try and assist that patient during the day . But if you deliver that communication poorly , that might kind of they 're not going to talk to you for the rest of the day , i 'm not saying anything he 's really cranky . I"
No," times . It was then cancelled for the fifth time and the mum lost it , and i completely agree with her and i said it 's fine . I know what to do so . I walked in and i said"
No," , mum come and have a seat with me . No , oh , i do n't know what to do and i literally stood there going while she was shouting at me because i did n't know what to do . I was like , but you sit down and i put my hand on you . So whilst sometimes we learn about"
No," prescriptive rules , sometimes they 're not always going to be the thing that we can do culturally appropriate there 's been times when i 've gone in and i 've said to i 've said to the child . When i came to australia , you guys use ."
No," Oh , do n't be a pork chop all the time , or at least you did in my ward - and i love that phrase and i used to use it all the time until i said it to a boy without even thinking look , i 'm just taking your bandaid off . Stop"
No," being a pork chop now that was fine . What i did n't really think of is the family were muslim , and that was a little bit taboo and i was like , oh my god . So what i 'm saying is do n't be like me : try and find out the people . Try and find"
No," , but they do have something that they 're not going to be fully dependent . So asthma is one : that 's probably your quite common one good croup , copd great one . So that 's a really good one , because um copd you 'll find that when you do the"
No," ops for patients with someone with copd , their sats are never going to be in the normal range , but just because they 're sat at 89 that might be normal for them . So that 's really good when we 're learning about"
No," our patient and you know changing different things based on them : good , cystic fibrosis , another one so good , so remembering just just because we 're kind of tackling these things and we know well , i do n't"
No," have asthma , i 've never smoked . I'Ve ! Never done this that does n't mean that we ca n't still be healthy because we 've got um , chronic , asthma or because we 've had copd so eating and drinking . Now this probably goes without saying as"
No," That does n't mean i 'm eating healthy . I could be eating macas for breakfast lunch and dinner . I could be re eating really poor calorie high dense with calories , but no nutritional Value"
No," and they were in quite a lot of pain and i offered some oral medication , But they were , they were on a month fast and i offered some oral panadol and he said i 'm really sorry . I ca n't take that because i 'm"
No," parenteral , for whatever reason they 've had some surgery , it could be max fact surgery , so they could have had dental surgery , some such as the jaw , i 'm also thinking of some oncology patients ."
No," mouth , grow really quickly , because , obviously , if you burn yourself with a coffee - and it took you Weeks for those cells to grow back , you 'd be in pain for ages . So what happens is it starts to kill"
No," to my friends about that like how do i go from never done it to i 'm gon na . Ask oh how many times do you poo in a day i did , however , have a student once who went to a pediatric patient and said : oh , have you"
No, opened your bowels and the the child said ? I do n't know so . The student came out to me and said they do n't know if they 've opened their bowels . I said what do you mean they do n't know like it 's pretty obvious . If you have - and i
No," said , do you think it might be that the child does n't know , i think the child was maybe nine , do you think they do n't know what opening your bowels means ? Ah , that might be it make sure you use the you know"
No," , terminology that best meets your your patient 's needs . Unfortunately , the student went into a nine year old and said : have you had a today that that did n't go down well to the mum who was sat in the room as well , but do make sure that you are when"
No," now , not just showering someone , but how do you stop yourself from pulling a face now ? That might seem like a really simple question , but i 've had to clean off people that have been"
No," that you make it really all these awkward things that you might be feeling really awkward doing , try and make it really nice for your patient . I asked my wife , obviously because i 've never i 've . I'Ve never"
No," rns . There is other people around to support you , because i know that when it comes to showering , they will often leave you on your own to do that shower . So please make sure if you 're ever uncomfortable , you 're going to need to do"
Environment," them , but try and think of your your safety and your comfort as well derma regulation . Can anyone think of any i 'm not going to really use the word disease but illness . Anyone think of any"
No," comes in with so an illness or a disease that someone comes in with um . I know i 've been banging on about peeds a lot , but that 's quite a common one that people attend because their child has a fever . If you have someone - and this does n't"
No," have to be a child , that could be your partner , your mum , whoever you 're living with whatever they 've , got a fever of um 38 . What should we be doing straight away ? What should we be doing for that person ? So if someone 's got a temperature now"
No," fever , but they Felt really cold and the la the first thing we want to do is go to bed and put a big dooner on now . That 'S obviously going to make it worse , so sometimes we might need to compromise and say well ."
No, leave them because nine out of ten i may have made that stat up there . Nine out of ten fevers are normally caused by a virus . What do we do for a virus ? Let it run its course . The more panadol you give and the
No," mobility . Now this is something you 're going to be doing when you 're labs that you 're going to be learning for things to assist people with their mobility , try and think of all those people . So this one here you 're going to be"
No," teaching each other to use a wheelie walker , but what we are doing is that , just because we 're teaching these - and you see them in lots of pictures - you know with someone a little bit old . I have seen lots of lots of children"
No," , lots of teenagers , adolescents use things like wheelie , walkers or other mobility aids , so just because you 're learning them in one context , you can use them in quite a lot of context . I 'M going to show you one thing here . So dvt"
No," so you 're going to be also learning how to put teds on someone now dvt is normally something in older people . Can anyone tell me why they think that might be i 'm not going to tell you if you 're right or wrong , but why do we think that dvt is more of"
No," a dvt work and play now for a lot of you . I 'M assuming that work and play probably would n't be something would n't be : an activity a daily living that is all engrossing within your life , yes , you 're at"
No," do . I mean i love my family , but a twoweek holiday , i 'm chomping at the bit to come back to work because i just feel like i 'm not doing anything productive now . How , then do we think , if we 're in an aged care facility"
No," , these people may have been retired ? For you know , 20 years they do n't really do much . They might not have a lot of family come in . How do we engage them in work and play ? What what kind of things do we think we might have known some people in an aged"
No," care facility ? We might have relatives what what do they do ? What do we think we can be part of ? Because i think , a lot of the time we put all these things on like we 're the ones that know"
No," , this is probably another one of those uncomfortable things , especially when we 're going into an aged care facility and we 're thinking . Oh my god , people are going to tell me about their sex lives . That could be what they 're going to tell you about , but , as you can see there , when"
No," , how we kind of see ourselves within our body . I will , however , say that when i was a student and i was looking for parttime work , i went onto the high street and i kind of gave my cvs out because we were old school then and"
No," they complain of abdo pain , the first thing we 're going to do is say we 're going to do a urine test and check if you 're pregnant . We obviously wait till the parents have left and then say this is what we 're going to do just to"
No," make sure when the the teenager bursts out crying , and you think i do n't think we need to do that . But now i need to tell the mum and then you all of a sudden in this position , that you then have to you know , and it"
No," so sleeping , unfortunately , through lots of research . Teenagers need a lot more sleep , so my my 10 year old , soon to be 11 year old . When he does n't wake up till 12 midday , unfortunately , i have to let him and because you know that 's"
No," going to improve his cognitive ability , i 'm quite happy to leave him to sleep till 3 , because his cognitive ability is not great um . The one thing i 'm going to mention with this one circadian rhythms now there 's lots of different things"
Environment," the night . I do n't know how that works , but have a look at circadian rhythms and how that can possibly because remember when we 're looking after patients that , in a completely different environment , they have n't seen the sun , for god knows"
No, how long their sleep pattern is going to be completely Disturbed which is then going to affect how they work and how they interact during the day . So try and think about how you can assist . Someone
No," have a normal sleep pattern because that 's going to have a massive impact on all of the different things they do during the day . I really want to do modeling for all these medical companies , because if you go onto the internet"
No," , there 's so many kind of different , weird things and the models just kind of you know like it 's just an everyday kind of activity . Oh here 's me with a mask . I'Ve had a sleep , apnea or a cpap . I would"
No, of different placements and one was an adult placement and it started off in an adult private hospital and Private hospitals in england are n't like here like if you 're got private health insurance in england you 're a bit of a snob .
No," Transcriber: Andrea McDonough Reviewer: Jessica Ruby In all times and places in our history, human beings have wondered, ""Where did we come from? What's our place in the world? What happens to us after we die?"" Religions are systems of belief"
No," a higher power we must answer to, or some source we all spring from and to which we must return. Hinduism means the religions of India. It's not a single religion but rather a variety of related beliefs and spiritual practices."
No," This escape is called moksha. Hinduism teaches that everything is one. The whole universe is one transcendent reality called Brahman, and there's just one Brahman but many gods within it, and their roles, aspects, and forms differ"
No," Ganesha has an elephant head and is the wise patron of success. Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world. And although most Hindus live in India, they can be found on every continent, one billion strong. Now, let's travel west,"
No," Israel sits at a crossroads through which many armies marched over the centuries. And in the year 70, the Romans destroyed the temple in their capital, Jerusalem. So, the religion transformed itself"
No," from a temple religion with sacrifices and priests to a religion of the book. Because of this, Judaism is a faith of symbolism, reverence, and deep meanings tied to the literature of its history. The many sacred scriptures make up"
No," and celebrate the weaving of their own lives into the faith, history, and texts of the Jewish people. There are 14 million Jews in the world today, 6 million in Israel, which became independent"
No," following the horrors of genocide in World War II, and 5 million in the United States. But now let's go back 2500 years and return to India where Buddhism began with a young prince named Siddhartha. On the night he was conceived, his mother, Queen Maya,"
No," is said to have been visited in her sleep by a white elephant who entered her side. Ten months later, Prince Siddartha was born into a life of luxury. Venturing forth from his sheltered existence as a young man, he witnessed the human suffering"
No," that looking for answers at the extremes was a mistake. The middle way between luxury and poverty seemed wisest. And while meditating under a bodhi tree, the rest of the answer came to him. All of life abounds with suffering."
No," right speech, right goals, a mind focused on what is real, and a heart focused on loving others. Many Buddhists believe in God or gods, but actions are more important than beliefs. There are nearly a billion Buddhists"
No," just as Buddhism grew out of Hinduism. The angel Gabriel was sent by the God of Abraham to ask a young woman named Mary to become the mother of his son. The son was Jesus, raised as a carpenter by Mary and her husband Joseph,"
No," and quickly spread word, convinced that he had been raised from the dead. The first Christians described his resurrected appearances, inspiring confidence that his message was true. The message: love one another as I have loved you. Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus"
No," in December at Christmas, and his suffering, death, and resurrection during Holy Week in the spring. In the ceremony of baptism, a washing away of sin and welcoming into the Christian community, recall Jesus's own baptism"
No," beautiful rhymes, and mysterious metaphors. But Muhammad was a merchant, not a poet. Many agreed the verses were indeed the words of God, and these believers became the first Muslims. The word Muslim means one who surrenders,"
No," meaning a person who submits to the will of God. A Muslim's five most important duties are called the Five Pillars: Shahada, Muslims declare publicly, there is no other God but Allah, and Muhammad is his final prophet; Salat, they pray five times a day facing Mecca;"
No," Zakat, every Muslim is required to give 2 or 3% of their net worth to the poor; Sawm, they fast during daylight hours for the lunar month of Ramadan to strengthen their willpower and their reliance on God; and Hajj, once in a lifetime,"
No," every Muslim who is able must make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, rehearsing for the time when they will stand before God to be judged worthy or unworthy of eternal life with Him. The words of God,"
No," in the Arabic language. Islam is the world's second largest religion, practiced by over one and a half billion Muslims around the globe. Religion has been an aspect of culture for as long as it has existed, and there are countless variations of its practice. But common to all religions"
No," is an appeal for meaning beyond the empty vanities and lowly realities of existence, beyond sin, suffering, and death, beyond fear,"
No," Hi everyone , my name , is dr Eric Hickman and I am from Lake Burien physical therapy , and I 'm here today to talk to you a little bit about how to nerves become sensitive . One of the things that we know about pain is that it is produced in the brain and in order for"
No, it to switch over to becoming chronic . There has to be a few things that are happening around you that we know will lead to higher incidence of somebody developing chronic pain . We do know that one in four people who start having pain that pain can just become chronic and
No," there does n't have to be any obvious reason . A couple of things we know about pain is that , if your pain happens as a result of a trauma , it 's much much more likely to become chronic . So what kind of traumas the most common is a car accident if you 've been in a car"
No," accident and you 've developed neck low back pain , any other types of pain in your body because of the car accident ? It 'S much more likely that your pain will stick around and again it 's because you were involved in a trauma . Most of us do n't get in the car and hope that we"
No," type of trauma that can happen . So we do see that no matter the actual damage or intensity of the car accident just being in a car accident , makes it much more likely that you will end up with chronic pain . So that 's the first situation or context . The second is a work , injury , a"
No," just a history . Whether recent or past a physical or emotional stress or trauma , so if you have had trauma in your lifetime , then it is much more likely that your pain , no matter when it happens , can be many many many years later , your pain is much more likely to become"
No," situations are much more likely to lead to somebody ending up in chronic pain . And so I hope that this helps , because again it 's a little bit of a shift from our understanding of pain , in the sense that we used to believe that , if somebody had you know , significant amounts of"
No," link between how much pain someone 's experiencing and how much tissue has actually been injured and , as a result of this , this is one of the neuroscientists and the scientists that study pain started . Looking a little bit more at , what 's happening around you what 's much"
No," more likely is that is there a situation , that 's occurring that could lead you to chronic pain and that 's when they saw these links between car accidents , work , injuries and just a history of trauma . I hope this helps understand a little bit more about context and pain . If you have"
No," Hey there and welcome to the CFS recovery Channel where we are dedicated to helping people just like you recover from chronic fatigue syndrome and fix their chronic pain . Now , if you 're , tired of feeling drained stuck in pain and in constant discomfort , you 're in the right"
Environment," place over the years , we 've helped hundreds of people reclaim their energy and vitality and we 're here to do the same for you . So today , I 'm excited to present to you . Our top five most popular videos about brand new training , specifically for pain , combined into a"
No," single comprehensive series . These are videos that resonated the most with our audience and we believe they contain the most valuable information for anybody looking to overcome CFS and chronic pain , so grab a pen and paper make yourself comfortable and get ready to take some"
No," notes and of all people . I know that recovering from CFS chronic pain can be a challenging and overwhelming process , but I 'm here to support you every single step of the way . So , let 's get started , let 's work together to create a healthier , more vibrant future for you"
Environment," , let 's Dive Right foreign , hey guys , how 's it going it 's Miguel here and today I want to talk about the number one brain retraining exercise that helped me recover the most , and so You know if I"
Environment," were to list all the exercises that I did for brain rear . Training like I 'd , lose track of them , they 're , probably a dozen or so , but the number one exercise that helped and the one that my doctor said . That would help the most that he had me doing it . Every day when I was in"
Environment," recovery , was this exercise where I visualize the pain centers in my brain , increasing and glowing and then kind of dimming out and the light going down . So what does that mean ? What are even the brain centers in the brain ? What is that , so they did studies showing that there 's"
No," 16 centers in your brain meant for processing pain . Now , I 'm going to break it down . Basically , your brain has 16 pain centers . Now these centers are not just for pain , they 're , also for processing . Other senses , like smell taste , touch sound things like that I 'll list . The"
No," rest right here , but essentially those areas in your brain are meant for processing all those things along with pain . So what happens is over time if you 're in chronic pain , you 're constantly feeling pain over long periods of time ? What happens is you know ? Typically , maybe"
No," it 's like 10 percent pain , 90 senses . Well , in extreme cases , those areas of your brain can actually shift to 50 pain . Processing and 50 sensory process accessing , so what that means is you could hear a sound , you could see a bright light , you could feel a touch and"
No," it will actually process pain , which is crazy . That explains why , when you hear loud sounds when you 're in lots of bright settings , maybe someone turns lights on , maybe something 's too noisy . It can cause headaches and things like that . That 'S because it triggers the pain"
Environment," that have immediate results ? Now , if you want something , that 's immediate results . Obviously the easiest thing is inhaling exhaling Doom , deep breathing exercises , but you do that , alongside with this you 'll you 'll get some pretty solid results , but to get lasting results to"
No," the point where you no longer have to practice them and the results you feel them kind of Indefinitely , you need to practice some kind of brain retraining for chronic pain . Specifically , you need to practice it for four to six weeks without seeing any results for it to"
No," have an effect , and that 's why most people it 's so hard for them to get out of that chronic pain pattern . It 'S all right , I feel like there 's something crawling in the bushes behind me anyways it typically people need to be dedicated and motivated to get rid of"
No," the pain , and what happens is in that article . He specifically says you need to see every episode of pain as an opportunity to to rewire your brain , and so for me I remember when I always"
No," started really get getting better . I would push myself to actually look and try to cause these symptoms to come up . So that way , when I feel that pain , then immediately , I 'm I 'm trying to refocus my brain on something else and reshift it to something else , and so"
Environment," that 's something I can touch on another video , but essentially the exercise . Is you want to imagine these pain centers in your grain think about them like glowing areas when you feel pain ? Let 'S say for me a lot of it . It was like tension , headaches and tension behind my"
No," that you know it gives it power over the pain , because you know so literally just try that right now to try . You close your eyes , Okay , think about what kind of pain you 're feeling feel that pain connecting to a certain"
No," area in your brain does n't have to be a specific place , but just in your brain feel where that pain is happening . I want you to see that glowing red hot Dot inhale , see that thing glowing just shining red , hot exhale and see the light getting smaller and"
No," little glimmer of red light inhale again see all that red light . Glowing feel that pain , expanding exhale feel that pain slowly going away , and now the light should almost not be visible . Now now , just visualize , your brain being completely dark , no red at"
Environment," all , so your body should feel significantly better than it was just two minutes ago , and so you could feel right now . The effects of something like this exercise , where you know you 're visualizing the pain and visualizing it going away for"
Environment," me . Let 'S when I was in the hospital , they first taught me about this exercise . I was still in a wheelchair at that point and it was helping me immediately , but then maybe 30 minutes 60 minutes later . I would start feeling the headaches slowly"
Environment," coming back and I would start you know feeling the symptoms slowly coming back the painful legs things like that , but I would just keep practicing that and over time I had to do it less and less so . These kind of brain retraining exercises and meditation it 's very intense in the"
Environment," beginning of your recovery , because you 're really needing to get out of that hole . For me it was uh . It was a mixture of doing the brain retraining exercises the completely different environment I was in , which is I get this pretty crazy , but I was in the hospital for four weeks"
No," another video , I can literally do a fullon story time . Like 30 minutes long , we did some pretty crazy stuff in there in a good way . It was great , like I made friends with all the people there they 're great people . I learned a lot that was one of the turning points"
Environment," because it shifted my environment , but that 's where I learned all of these things from my doctor , because I got to work with him every day , which is the main reason I agreed to stay and stay in A place like that , but anyways going off on a tangent here"
Environment," back to the main point that is the most impactful brain retraining exercise that worked for me that I saw results from that even to this day . If I think of one exercise that came up one exercise that one exercise that impacted me , the most it had to be that"
Environment," specific exercise um , I do n't really have a name for it . I should probably name it or something : it 's probably trademark it or I 'm joking , but yeah , seeing those pain , centers , glowing and then diminishing . It got to the point where you know . I really"
No," understood that these episodes of pain were not negative things . There are opportunities to rewire . Your brain um , you know when your brain wants to go down one route of chronic pain , you 've , rewire it and force it to go down another road , that 's the whole point of"
No," neuroplasticity and brain retraining , you 're retraining it to go a different route . So when you are experiences when you are experiencing this pain , you know for me , I did n't see it did something negative . It got to the point where I was like great . I got symptoms to"
No," work with . I can start . This is where the practice happens like this is literally the practice . This is where it counts , the most when I 'm in pain and then over time the pain was less and"
No," less and , like I said I would even push myself so that I could feel symptoms so that I could you know , work on retraining the brain , so maybe I'Ll do another video where I actually draw it on a diagram , the what I mean by the pain centers and how you know it goes from"
Environment," 10 pain to 90 processing senses . In extreme cases . It goes to 50 pain , 50 processing senses , but I hope that helps a lot . I 'M sure it will . We did that very quick exercise . Try that try that multiple times a day you know the more you do it , the better you will get"
No," honestly it was . It was honestly lifechanging for me , so if you enjoyed this video , if you got some value out of it , hit the like button below comment down , what other kind of videos you would like to see me create other topics you want me to cover . I have a bunch ready"
Environment," things on my journey , so I just want to help you guys on your journey . Hopefully , one day you 'll be messaging me and we 'll be laughing about this whole thing and being like hey , remember that time when I was super sick reach out to you , show me this exercise and now I 'm so"
No," much better and that 's actually happened with a couple people . You know they 've felt better one person in particular : that 's fully recovered , I 'm looking at stories and she 's like freaking partying now , so she really has her life back . She has a family everything , but you know if"
Environment," different symptoms , but at the end of the day you know the brain is the brain science and Science and exercise this will 100 help . You move the needle forward and help you towards your full recovery . So I hope you have a great day if you 're"
Environment," , which was up here and the number one brand new training exercise that helped me recover . Now a lot of people ask me : when is the best time to use these brain retraining exercises ? How often should I do them , and how long should I do them , for those are the pretty much the three"
Environment, after eight months I was in the hospital . Then they released me and I learned all the brand new training stuff and I was able to go into the real world now . I was still feeling a lot of symptoms when I got out of the hospital and it 's not like it just went away overnight . It 'S
Environment," not like I just did it did a bunch of brand new training in the hospital and then , as soon as I got out , I was completely normal . No , there was still a lot of stuff that I had to deal with , leaving the hospital so brand new training is actually an ongoing thing . It"
No," never really stops and it really ends really . It comes down to being aware of what you 're feeling physically and mentally . So you always got to catch your thoughts , catch your thinking patterns whenever you 're thinking negative whenever you 're starting to worry ."
Environment," going down a set path . So it 's used to just being on autopilot , going down some negative pathway or negative thinking or constant worrying . Will you actually changing that path of those thoughts is technically a form of brain new training ? Now it becomes even more"
Environment," want to do the brand new training , then right there on the spot . So for me it did n't really matter where it was . I could be sitting in the back of a car being driven somewhere and have a little bit of a headache . I would close my eyes for just one or two minutes : really"
Environment," : that 's all it took and do that brand new training , exercise of having the pain , centers glowing and then having them dim down and having the pain slowly go away so other times . I would be at a mall with my girlfriend and she would be shopping for something and me just walking around"
Environment," the mall would make me start feeling some symptoms . So I would sit down close my eyes , one two , even three minutes and do that exercise and it was a constant thing going on throughout the day . This is not something that you have to schedule in your calendar and make sure"
No," , maybe you 're , waiting for the microwave to go down two minutes . This is something you could do very easily when you 're in that stage . Now the interesting thing is a lot of times . We forget that we can actually affect our level of pain . So for me I would actually forget it all the"
No, time I 'd be sitting there or lying there with a headache or having some tension in my head after I got out of the hospital every time I would try to expand my activities . My body would need that adjustment period where I would feel
No," time . I had pain . I would do it when the pain got to that point of being . You know very annoying and I wanted to get rid of it . That 'S when I would practice it the most and in the beginning , you 're going to be doing it a lot more versus down the road . When you start getting a little"
No," important the mental aspect of dealing with symptoms . So when you feel symptoms , my automatic response wrote five years was to start worrying , get anxious start thinking of what could happen next or if this is gon na wondering if this is gon na"
No," snowball into a huge crash , and that really did me no good . So , every time I would have physical or psychological symptoms like worrying anxiety , fear , you know I would try to solve it right away and attack it head on . If it was really bothering me if it"
No," was something that was just kind of lingering in the background , then you know it did n't bother me too much and I would just do whatever I was doing during the day . So that 's a huge thing , too , is remembering that you actually have this tool at your disposal and , like"
No," I said in my previous video , it 's not going to work right away and the pain is n't going to go away over a short period of time . It 'S going to take a few weeks or months for me honestly . It took me about 18 to 24 months so a year and a"
No, half to two months to really get rid of the pain and actually live like completely normal and not have any symptoms at all . I was getting a few headaches here and there I was staring at a screen quite a bit . That was one of the things I would trigger some Burning
Environment," Sensations in my head same with palpitations , but you want to use a brand new training for those lingering things . You know if you 're getting like palpitations , you ca n't really do brand new training to get rid of that because it goes by so fast like it happens in a"
Environment," split second and before you know it , it 's gone . You want to do the brand new training for stuff . That 'S lingering : throughout the day , that 's really bothering you or annoying you or you find it 's hindering your recovery . So for me it was the headaches . It was"
Environment," recovery . So just keep that in mind when you do have those dipping periods , it 's very very it 's extremely crucial that you do those brand new training exercises or go down a different thinking route or a different thinking . Pattern and just not be stuck in that"
No," same negative cycle of worrying , and then that leads to more symptoms , and then that leads to more worry , which leaves some more symptoms . And it 's just like a snowball . So you want to cut that right into the path and stop that anxiety , Loop and that fear Loop , because that 's what 's"
Environment," going to keep you in the same place . Instead do the brand new training exercises for any physical pain that you 're having ? And you wo n't remember every single time you have paint , there are going to be times when you know you 're going"
Environment," , take it day by day pace yourself , do n't expect change to happen overnight . Like I said , it 's been shown that most people need to be doing the brain new training activities for four to six weeks with seeing minimal . If , if not any results"
Environment, were n't consistent with the brand new training . So it 's something that you constantly got to do and do it multiple times a day does n't mean you have to do it for five or ten or even 15 minutes in a day . Do it for like 30 seconds or a minute
No," , even two minutes all right . It does n't have to be this crazy thing that you have to schedule around just do it as you 're , going throughout your day in this video , I 'm going to be talking about chronic fatigue syndrome versus fibromyalgia . Now , having been someone"
No," , who 's experienced both severe fatigue and severe pain , chronic pain all over my body , I feel like I 'm someone who is who is qualified to talk on this , because I 've actually experienced it myself , let 's rewind the clock a little bit when I first started Developing a lot of"
No," these symptoms , it usually started off as a lot of anxiety , a lot of wiredness a lot of that buzzing sensation . Those vibration feelings all over my body . It started off as like insomnia , lots of IBS food sensitivities and then it turned into lots of fatigue , and it was n't until"
No," about year , two and three , when I got really really bad pain . I started to develop very extreme pain in terms of migraines headaches . Tension , headaches were almost always there for a few years . I had it almost every single day , as well as body aches and Burning Sensations all"
No," over my skin . I think that 's really common for people with fibromyalgia . Now I 'm not saying that I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia . I 'M just saying the amount of pain that I dealt with , I feel like , depending on what Doctor I would have went to , I could have been diagnosed with"
No," a lot of different things and even then it 's not so important to be labeled a certain thing , even if You get diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome , even if you get diagnosed with fibromyalgia at the end of the day . Do they really have a solution for you ? Sometimes they do most"
No," really it 's just two different labels . On the same problem and it 's a hypersensitive nervous system now , when we talk about fibromyalgia , I 'm going to talk more about the chronic pain side of things , because you know I can speak on this because I"
No," experienced it quite a bit . I'Ve done a lot of research on this . My pain most of the time was 10 out of 10. , especially during adjustment periods . It was really bad to the point where I did n't even want to walk around my house . I did n't want to go to the washroom because my"
Environment," body hurts so bad . The solution to dealing with chronic pain is doing brand new training for chronic pain , because you can totally retrain these pain , centers and I 'll . Save that for the other video up here , where I dive really deep into that this video , I want to keep it"
No, more general of how chronic fatigue syndrome ties into fibromyalgia and how they play into each other and how they 're both very similar and deal with the Same issue : a hypersensitive nervous system Disorder . So if you wanted to learn more about the science of the
No," chronic pain and how to deal with that , how to overcome it once and for all , not just temporarily but for good make sure to click that video up here at one point . Actually , at my worst there was this one night I actually felt paralyzed as in I felt pins and needles all over my body"
No," , and I literally could not roll over in bed , because when I try to roll over , it was extremely hard to breathe and it felt Like someone was just squeezing my bones from the inside out and just like yeah , I ca n't even describe it if you have a lot of chronic pain at those"
No," extreme levels . You know what I 'm talking about . It also feels like you 're kind of being electrocuted or burned . There 'S like Burning Sensations on your skin and this one night , my dad . Actually you know , because I told him and my girlfriend at the time you know she was there helping"
No," me . I stayed up essentially all night did n't get a wink of sleep , because I was in so much pain . My dad , I told him not to touch me because everything hurt so my dad . He was just testing it out , so he put his hand on my shin just to place his hand on me"
No," slap shot hockey puck to your shin right to get hit with a hockey stick or to fall on concrete . I know those pains . This was the worst one of the worst pains . I'Ve ever felt . It literally felt like someone winded up and hit me in the shin , and you know the pain . It is real , it is"
No," real pain , but what I did n't realize and what he told me months after I got better . We talked about that night again . I was like Dad remember that time where I was literally paralyzed and you just touched my leg and I was in excruciating pain . You know what he told me . You know"
No," lot of this pain . What we need to understand is there 's a difference between chronic pain and acute pain , two different things - and I have a lot of videos talking about this breaking these Concepts down , especially with the brain retraining guide for chronic pain , which"
No," you can find that video right up Here I also have a guide for it , which you can find in the link in the description now for acute pain . I 'M actually going to read the definition of acute pain . Acute pain is a sudden , sharp pain that lasts less than six months . Acute pain acts as"
No," a warning sign to your body that it is unsafe and its Health has been compromised . A common belief is that acute pain is mild and temporary , but in fact acute pain is very complex , so an example of acute pain . Is you fall off your motorcycle and break your elbow"
No," into that table five times in a row and it 's still fine . The pain is going to come after 15 to 20 seconds is going to be gone . That 'S an example of pain being sent from your body to your brain , that 's acute pain and what happens is over time . Let 'S say I walk into the corner of this"
No," table 50 times . Eventually , my brain is going to catch on and be like . Okay , we got to be extra careful around that . So , every time we walk by that corner of the table , we 're going to trigger a little bit of pain , and so every time I walk by this without even walking into the table"
No," , my brain is going to send pain from up here to my body . So it 's the other way around and acute pain is my body to my brain and chronic pain . It 'S my brain into my body and it 's a warning signal . It 'S to try to protect you and so chronic pain is longstanding pain that"
No," persists beyond the usual recovery period or occurs along with a chronic health condition such as arthritis , chronic pain , maybe on and off or continuous . It may affect people to the point that they ca n't work , eat properly , take part in physical activity or enjoy"
No," treatments and while it would help temporarily , it would always come back and my neck would stiffen up right same thing with my body same thing with attention headaches , I Thought I had TMJ , which I did a little bit , because I was jaw cleansing because I was so stressed"
No," , but eventually what I realized is that I can massage my jaw muscles and you know the pain would go away a little bit . But eventually the headaches would come back because it was a mix of multiple things . So when it comes to fibromyalgia , people get that label , because the chronic pain"
No," is more obvious and apparent , and it 's a bigger problem than fatigue , but typically people with chronic pain or fibromyalgia . Also have some fatigue because when you do suffer with lots of pain , it 's very draining on you not just emotionally but physically . You know . The"
No," pain is almost like an energy leak in your body . Think of your body having this bucket of energy . If there 's a leak , where there 's a constant energy flow out of your body , eventually it 's going to get drained , and so that 's what chronic pain is ? It 'S really debilitating . That 'S . Why"
No," , because you 're focusing on not moving too fast or not doing too much versus actually enjoying the things you 're doing so with fibromyalgia , the main concern is pain versus other things like heart , palpitations or high heart rate or extreme fatigue . But you can actually"
No," have an overlapping of all of these symptoms , so for me I had all of it . In addition to the fatigue , I had tons of anxiety , tons of chronic pain and that 's really a case of the body gone wild . The way my doctor described it to me was your brain : has these certain limiters it"
No," cars , it 's just an example . We have a basic card , then we have a sports car . We have a daily driver . You know that a typical family has , or we have something that 's designed to race on a track . They have different settings on them and different limitations . If we tried to"
No," threshold , make sure to watch this video up here . Where I really break that down , if we go above and beyond our stress threshold , our brain starts to put limitations on our bodies in the form of a fatigue , B , anxiety or C chronic pain . For me , I felt a lot of anxiety coming on"
No," first and then , when I ignored it , and I just kept adding on stress or kept maintaining that level of stress , it turned into lots of fatigue . In addition to the anxiety and the fatigue , the brain threw in this other layer of limiters , which was the chronic pain and over time"
No," end of the day , the more emotionally charged . We are . The more worry anxiety fear frustration , anger that we feel the more hopeless we feel the more we go into the sympathetic state of fight or flight . So it 's almost like a chain reaction right . It 'S this domino effect"
No," , but really chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia . Essentially , I see it as the same thing , because there are people in the recovery Jumpstart program who have both , who maybe have more pain , maybe have more fatigue , but usually it 's a mix of a lot of stuff , especially during"
No," adjustment periods . That 'S where a lot of these symptoms flare up people in the program , they 're recovering with the exact same approach , but multiple different diagnoses right , even people with mitochondria dysfunction , people who have had covid and they 've been stuck"
No," and when we do that , then the symptoms start to go down . Then the chronic pain starts to go down and the fatigue goes down . The brain starts to take the limiters off of the body , so chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia very similar . In my experience , both can be"
No," placed under the umbrella of a hypersensitive nervous system issue , along with the dozens of other symptoms that people experience with this . But , of course , as always , make sure to consult with a doctorate and and do the proper testing necessary to rule out any other"
No, potential health issues you have if everything comes back negative or there 's nothing that they find . That explains all of the symptoms that you 're feeling you can rest assure that this is a hypersensitive nervous system issue . So if you were experiencing a lot of these
No," and learning more confusing things . My whole goal is to actually simplify everything , because that 's the way to get out of this thing right is to simplify not to make it more confusing , and once we simplify it once you guys really understand what 's going on , and you know"
Environment," black and white , and you Internalize the principles of recovery recovery becomes inevitable . This is going to be a very quick short straight to the point , video of how to do the brain retraining exercise for chronic pain , I 'm going to walk you"
Environment," through it . This is a powerful exercise that helped me completely . Get rid of my chronic pain and someone like me : I was suffering with pain all over . It was a 10 out of 10 , almost all the time headaches , migraines Burning , Sensations all over my body . So this is something that I 've"
Environment," tried myself and I actually learned about those exercises from a famous doctor called Dr Moskowitz , and he 's actually uses exercise to help thousands of people around the world deal with chronic pain even deal with things like neck injuries , spine injuries , people With"
Environment," into it . A lot of people ask when is the best time to do this brain retraining exercise well the best time there is no perfect time to do it . Ideally , you want to do this before the pain gets above a seven or eight , although it may still work when your pain really gets up there"
Environment," , but you want to do it when the pain is somewhat manageable and uh , not the worst . It 'S been , and you want to do this exercise at least 20 minutes a day , spread out throughout the day now , obviously the more you do , this , the better results you 'll get , but do this"
Environment," for at least 20 minutes a day for at least a couple weeks before Saying No , this does n't work for me and that 's the big thing . A lot of people just give up way too soon , when they 're trying this exercise now , there 's four simple steps to this exercise : number one is going to"
No," be identifying the pain , so just close your eyes . Take notice of where you 're feeling the pain in your body is it in your head ? Is it behind your eyes ? You want to be very specific . Is it somewhere in your body ? For me , I used to get pain all over my"
No," head . All over my body . It was like a burning sensation . Now , once you identify that pain , you want to connect that to your brain 's pain , centers , now imagine there 's glowing areas in your brain . There 'S 16 of them now really feel how they 're connected and Associate that"
No," glow in your brain , with the pain that you 're feeling in your body step number three is keep your eyes closed , just relax start doing some slow , deep breathing relax the body , but I want you To focus on expanding those pain , centers in your brain just a little bit"
No," right , we want to expand those pain centers in the brain and , at the same time , you 're going to feel pain , increase just a little bit feel the pain increasing just a tad . We do n't want it to get too out of control step . Four is we 're gon na ? Have these pain centers in"
No," our brain start dimming down right , so we want to see the glow start to diminish . We want those epicenters to get smaller in your brain and at the same time , because they are associated with the pain you 're feeling in your body , you 're , going to feel the pain in"
No," your body slowly start to dissipate now we 're going to increase it back up again . This is where we go back between step three and step four , a few times just to show our brain , that it 's in control of the level of pain that it 's experiencing so increase that glow just a little bit"
No," times , and so in a nutshell , that 's what you want to do multiple times a day and that 's when you 're going to start retraining your brain and really Show it that it 's in control that it can actually affect the level of pain it is"
No," can see how to do it . You can actually keep that on your phone as well , so you have a guide right there . It 'S a brain retraining guide for chronic pain , just click , the link down below and you 'll be able to get access to that now . If you have n't already hit that subscribe"
No," button hit that like button , it helps the channel grow a lot . I hope you took a lot of value from this video now , if you 're ready to take recovery to the next level , I highly recommend our recovery Jumpstart program . It 'S an interactive program designed to"
No," around the world , other thrivers , just like yourself and when you 're surrounded by people with that kind of mentality who are not victims , who do n't just complain about Their symptoms and do n't really have hope for a few future when you 're surrounded by people who are"
Environment," Hello there once again , today 's lesson is going to be on environmental quality and , at the end of today 's topic , you should be able to state the advantages of a healthy environment , state , the disadvantages of degrading the environment , identify ways of maintaining"
Environment," a healthy and beautiful school environment And also lists the materials for maintaining a healthy environment . Are you ready , then ? Let 'S begin now , let 's talk about the environment and environmental quality . Environmental quality means to maintain a balance"
Environment, between human activities and a healthy condition of the environment . This results in what is known as sustainable development . Human activity at times has a negative impact on the natural conditions of the environment . The environment is blessed with natural and
Environment," material resources which man exploits in order to affect changes in the environment . Now , let 's quickly , look at what our physical environment is made of the components of the environment include number one : the atmosphere . Now the atmosphere is made up of the gaseous"
Environment," earth . In the earth and beneath the earth surface human beings carry out various activities on the environment . Some of these activities include construction of projects . These include roads , airports , seaports and rail ; secondly , exploration and exploitation of minerals and"
Environment," natural resources , and also residential purposes . This includes rural and urban development of houses . Some practices also include agricultural practices . Now this involves the rearing of animals and the cultivation of land . The environment is also used for industrial purposes , and"
Environment," this deals with the location of industries . Deforestation is another activity carried out by humans on the environment , and this may occur through bush burning and tree . Cutting a healthy environment is an environment that is safe for the survival of all living"
Environment," organisms , especially humans . A healthy environment helps us to maintain a sickness free life . It also ensures the survival of all living things , including humans , a healthy environment , guarantees , economic and social development . A healthy environment"
Environment, also ensures the safety of human lives . So what happens when the environment is unhealthy ? Degradation of the environment takes place if the environment is not properly cared for . An unhealthy environment can lead to death as a result of poor health . They may be
Environment," destruction of some species of plants and animals . Industrial pollution may cause various types of illnesses , disabilities and diseases . A poor and degraded environment can cause floods and erosion , deforestation in dangers . The survival of animals polluted air can"
Environment," cause chronic respiratory diseases . I am sure by now you must be asking yourself : how can we maintain a healthy environment to avoid degradation ? Well , a healthy environment can be maintained through the following ways : environmental sanitation should be maintained from"
Environment, Environmental Protection Agency FERPA now FERPA was established in 1988 for environmental management and protection . Another of such agencies is the Ministry of Environment . Now the Ministry designs and follows up appropriate measures for refuse and sewage management . A campaign
Environment," should also be made against deforestation . Now , in order to maintain a healthy environment , the following materials can be used number one : a broom for sweeping number two , a mop and bucket for mop in the floor number three dust bins for collecting , refuse in schools"
Environment," about environmental quality , but to make sure let 's go over it once again . Environmental quality means to maintain a balance between human activities and healthy condition of the environment . The environment is made up of the atmosphere . The lithosphere and hydrosphere a"
Environment," healthy environment provides a safe space for all organisms . A degraded environment reduces the quality of life for all organisms . We can maintain a healthy environment by observing regular sanitation , disposing waste , conserving natural resources etc , and some of the"
Environment," materials we can use to maintain a healthy environment include cutlasses , hoes , brooms , mops and disinfectants . So now that you 've learnt all there is to know about environmental quality . Here is a little class work for you to do number one : what is the meaning of a healthy"
Environment," environment number two ? How can human activities affect ? I am and number 3 lists 5 materials that are used to maintain a healthy environment . Number 4 state for advantages of a healthy environment , number 5 state , two ways of beautifying"
Environment," the environment and finally , number six mentioned three disadvantages of degrading : the environment."
Environment," Welcome to the cambridge festival and welcome to this event , which is focusing on a very important question , which is about how climate change will affect our health . This event is being hosted"
Environment," program is not only recruiting academically outstanding researchers , but placing a really important emphasis on social impact . The subject of today 's panel discussion is right at the center of those concerns . As we know , climate change is likely to"
Environment, speakers . Kim van dalen is going to be talking about her research and advocacy for climate change and health . Ritika subramanyam is going to be talking about her research on climate migration in india and the knockon effect on women and
No," his research on housing and energy conservation . Just to tell you a little bit about the format of our discussion , each speaker will be speaking for about five minutes on on their subject"
Environment," epidemiology , she 's , focusing on environmental metal pollution and risks associated with that on cardiovascular disease . Alongside her phd she 's part of the lancet countdown"
Environment," where she focuses on climate change and health issues , specifically in europe , kim thank you and over to you . So , thank you so much especially to many for inviting me here today to talk about one of my"
Environment," biggest passions , which is climate change and health . I 'M very excited for the upcoming hour and especially excited to hear from my colleague scholars as well . I will be presenting after me so like you 've , already heard in my phd i 'm focusing on"
Environment," environmental arsenic pollution and risk on cardiovascular disease . However , my broader interests are more in climate change , health , environmental pollution and specifically their interaction with inequities . So next to my phd"
Environment," , i also work for the landslide countdown , which is an international collaboration of over 120 academics . That summarize , the interaction between climate change and health every year and these findings are being published in a medical journal called"
Environment," the landslides , and these data make clear how climate change is affecting our health . The consequences of the late action , as well as the health benefits of a reduced response and accompanying these academic reports ."
Environment," for the european union together with cpme , which has also been presented as european parliament , and all of this is happening ahead of the u.n climate negotiations . In order to provide the scientific"
Environment," evidence that , hopefully , is able to influence international policy as well , but how is climate change actually impacting human health ? Well , although human health has been intimately connected to our weather and climate , where climate"
Environment," is now changing more rapidly and more dramatically than ever , and this means that the environment that provides us with clean air , food , water , shelter and security is being impacting as well as that . Our bodies are being"
Environment," impacted directly , so populations around the world are adversely impacted by things as extreme weather events , air pollution and heat waves , and we see increases in things as cardiovascular disease"
Environment," , but also respiratory disease and heat related illnesses . We also see infectious diseases now popping up at regions that they did n't show up before , and it 's not just heat or just air pollution . What we 're worried about"
Environment," what we 're really worried about is this multihit scenario , whereby climate change in a way correlates previously uncorrelated health risks , meaning that we see a lot of different health impacts at the same time"
Environment," Like overt 19 , climate change refused deeper questions of justice whereby climate change is interacting with existing social and economic inequalities and is exacerbating longstanding trends of inequalities within and between"
Environment," countries . So therefore , we often call climate change as a socalled healthtrack multiplier , provide this intensifying challenges of not only health but also of health determinants"
Environment," , including things as hunger , poverty and conflict . So the people that are being contributing , the least to climate change , are being impacted . The most and i specifically wanted to focus a bit on gender equality in climate change and"
Environment," the gendered impacts of climate change on human health , as well as the representation of women in climate policies . So we know that all genders differ in their needs . Perception attitudes and vulnerability to the effects of climate change"
Environment," and , although the converse may be true in some places in many regions , women and girls have increased health risk as a result of climate change compared to boys and men . Traditional gender roles mean that women and their children spend comparatively"
Environment," greater amounts of time in homes than boys and men do , and consequently they are more likely to be exposed to , for example , indoor particulate matter , which is another word for air pollution from the use of , for Example , traditional indoor stoves for cooking and heating"
Environment," nutritional needs compared to men and boys , and are more likely to skip meals in terms of food insecurity because they are lower in the household food hierarchies . Likewise , climate change may also affect women 's ability to seek reproductive and"
Environment," marginalized clubs and , for example , conditions populations , are not being heard at climate negotiations . Despite that , there has been a focus on the gender action plan in international climate negotiations . In the last"
No," few cups , we see that women are being represented as only a very fraction of the total delegates . So in cop24 , for example , only 38 of delegates were women and only 27 have had of delegations , and this may result in communities ."
Environment," Countries involved being less prepared for climate change and already vulnerable population being disproportionately bearing the impacts of climate change , just because women 's unique perspectives and expertise in not being included . Why"
Environment," is all of this so important ? Why is it important that we think about public health when they think about climate change policy and vice versa ? Well , there are various reasons for that , and one of the reasons is that"
Environment," , while climate change is already impacting human health , i just showed you a slide at the beginning of all the different health impacts that climate change had , but likewise climate change , mitigation and adaptation also Results in"
Environment," significant health code benefits to cleaner air , healthier diets and more liveable cities . So what i mean by that is that the actions that we undertake to prevent climate change or to adapt to climate change"
Environment," actually have a positive impact on human health , so things , for example , about air pollution . The world health organization has estimated that around 7 million people a year die as a result of air pollution , but with climate change mitigation"
Environment," policies . Next to reducing global warming , we 're also reducing air pollution and therefore reducing the amount of people that die every year . As a result of air pollution and also think about things to improve active transport and thereby"
No," reduce the amount of people that use their car to go , places that will improve people 's cardiovascular health , reduce people 's chances on developing obesity as well as that their mental health will Be improving but"
Environment," thirdly , a health framing of climate change has shown to increase support for mitigation policies , so , instead of climate change being some abstract faraway problem talking about health makes it something that is"
Environment," , climate change is exacerbating existing inequalities . However , national efforts continue to fall short on the commitments made in the paris agreements , so it 's now important that we make sure that we align the global recovery from"
Environment," covert 19 with our response to climate change , and this can result in a triple win . We can improve public health , create a sustainable economy and protect the environment . At the same time , however , we need to take in minds that"
Environment," , although climate change is often cited as being the biggest global health threat of the 21st century , at the same time , climate change action is likewise the biggest health opportunity"
Environment," marriage and climate migration in western india . Ritika subramanyam is is has worked as a journalist and researcher for the last 10 years in india and brings both her sort of experiences from that , as well as her"
Environment," be remembered as the year the covet 19 pandemic hit . It was also the year in which the effects of the climate crisis continued unabated : the dramatic cyclone amphan that damaged parts of india and bangladesh , devastating wildfires in australia and"
No," earth 's inhabitants that tell us a true story in the global south . These impacts are far more devastating for vulnerable indigenous tribal and rural communities , given their historical compulsions , as well as the lack of access to resources"
Environment, and opportunities and the climate side crisis as event kim indicated is most certainly not gender neutral . The office of the high commissioner for human rights study on climate change and gender
Environment," revealed that in general , it is the women and girls who bear the brunt of the climate crisis . A clear majority of the world 's 1.5 billion people living on one dollar a day or less are women and girls predominantly from the"
Environment," global south , who rely most heavily on those natural resources susceptible to climate change . Now the unequal access to resources and decisionmaking processes , along with limited mobility , exposes them to the more negative effects of climate"
Environment," Recently , the international union for the conservation of nature has also found that increased environment , stress and resource scarcity leads to increase in genderbased violence , which includes domestic abuse , sexual assault , rape force prostitution , a"
Environment," higher incidence of human trafficking , in naturally distressed regions and an entire generation of Child rights , climate rights is being created globally . Amidst this burgeoning crisis , a drawing on my journalism and"
Environment, ethnographic work back in india . I will take this conversation forward by training the spotlight on this invisible and extremely vulnerable group of climate rights in the global south . Now let me begin by narrating a story
No," , forced abortions , maternal mortalities , as well as post hysterectomies of young women in this region , and the rates of early and child marriages have multiplied manifold . Now , speaking in marathi , mala told me that she had begged her parents to wait"
No," , but the family had no land of its own . There was no water in the well . The crops had died . Her parents said there was no money to keep her two days after her secret wedding at home mala and her husband were already"
No," Thus , for mala marriage became an inevitable step to transition from being a daughter and schoolgoer into becoming a wife and wage labourer to survive the drought and the scarcity now globally , too . A growing body of largely empirical"
Environment," literature , particularly in asia and africa , examines the disproportionate impacts of and the potential interlinkages between early marriage , climate change and natural disasters . Now , in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami"
No," , for instance , minor girls in in indonesia and sri lanka were reportedly forced into marriage with tsunami widowers and , in many instances , did so to receive state subsidies for marrying and starting a family"
Environment," in more recent times . The climate crisis . In south sudan , compounded the already precarious situation on the ground , in addition to the impact of the civil war , the landlocked african country witnessed long periods of droughts since 2017"
No," , which were then followed by catastrophic floods . In 2019 , the crisis devastated the harvest creating extreme food shortages . This insecurity forced many families to marry of their girls in exchange for livestock using the"
No," , interact worldwide and plan international reported an increased occurrence of child marriage across the 62 affected districts . Now these are common narratives . What they make clear is that , even as"
Environment," robust scientific data is still lacking , qualitative research in the regions affected by frequent and intense ecological disasters are progressively witnessing how climate change intersects with and exacerbates existing structural"
No," hierarchies and power . Inequalities from increased labour for obtaining water , fuel and food for their families and facing new obstacles due to intense droughts and floods , escalations of violence , including sexual abuse and rape"
Environment, in the wake of disaster and additional challenges to access assistance and humanitarian aid during disasters . Research indicates that marrying off a minor daughter during a climate related disaster can mean there is one less mouth to feed .
Environment," Finally , feminist responses to the global climate crisis call for fundamental system changes , with a focus on a just inclusive , regenerative , green and carebased economy and developing a broadbased understanding of the"
Environment," challenges intensified by climate change and their meaningful participation and the amplification of their voices is essential , as girls will hold knowledge that is key for shaping climate resilience in the near future ."
Environment," on a very interesting topic . That has been part of my work for the last 10 years in research and moving on from the two very interesting topics of discussion . I 'D like to speak about climate change , related impacts in the"
Environment, built environment . One main direct implication of of climate change to health is the increasing case of thermal discomfort in buildings that has led to increasing increase increasingly high levels of thermal
Environment," in a tropical region and part of my phd thesis , was researching on the impact of climate change on the indooverheating phenomenon across time across a hundred years , and also as well"
Environment," years of nairobi 's climate and , more importantly , what design alternatives there are and or species actions . There are to mitigate this phenomenon across time and an interesting outcome actually from"
Environment," how how then we can restructure nairobi 's building code to include legislation that governs climate management to manage and overheating risk . As well as identifying what what regulations or how , how then you can you"
Environment," , looking how um this work could advise policy in especially the built environment , but i 've also been trying to expand the scope of the different pathways and outcomes for my phd to manage key priority areas of"
Environment," challenges in my country , kenya , because It seems that climate change management , if put across the different priority areas , it takes a back seat and you find the youth unemployment problem is a major factor"
Environment, um considered during policy as an adjunct matter or the aspect of increasing managing increase in poverty levels and and What i managed to do is to see how then to infuse uh climate change management solutions
Environment," in nairobi , in Particular and if i and i 'm slowly finding that this space of the science policy practice space is one to watch out for , especially when you 're discussing on how to manage um impacts of climate change very"
No," in energy policy here at cambridge and he 's also a visiting researcher at the international energy agency in france . His research intersects questions of energy , justice"
Environment," of data science and poverty alleviation , uh and again he 's going to be talking about some of these issues in the context of our subject around climate change and health . So ramit over to you and thank you"
Environment," for um . For speaking . Thank you oscar till now , what we have heard is all the intersectional elements that affect climate , for example , the effects on gender , the effects on health , the effects on the built environment ."
Environment," three study areas in india , brazil and nigeria , where it 's the same case that urbanization forcing people to live in slums , and then these built environment have its more uh impact on lack of welfare or"
No," lack of distributive elements in terms of better health , clean Energy access and health outcomes in as well so the three sdgs that are very important are good : health and"
Environment," wellbeing , uh , gender equality and um . The clean energy access and one problem that is very common with climate change - is that heat waves . So , as katha mentioned , that the indoor heating is extremely high , especially in these"
Environment," very cumulative effect on electricity demand , so rising electricity demand , but low income and poverty is a very bad combination . So my way is to find out what are the ways and what are the solutions that can come up"
Environment, from the community itself . So just policy design in this sense integrate or means that how can we combat or fight the climate change impacts also provide clean energy and wellbeing in a broader goal that
No," trickles down to a good health outcome and wellbeing as well ? One way of using is is using modern , uh technologies , using machine learning and uh artificial intelligence , especially when we have a huge amount of"
No," data in terms of uh deliberations or speech from people . So what i did was go to these communities talk to the people who live there , especially women who live there and they uh kind of have the most interaction with energy"
Environment," services and the built environment in these slums and have their voices together to kind of understand What is the common commonality between injustices in this area , especially when they are forced to pay a huge"
Environment," in india , a very big problem was the urban design itself of These slums , and also the slum rehabilitation housing which are the social housing that the government is planning to rehabilitate these people . So the problem was there is no"
Environment," that i am forced to stay inside . My social housing , which is approximately 24 meters square , just like a single room , and i have to bear the burnt of climate because it 's extremely hot inside and earlier in the slums they used to"
Environment," effect that people are forced to live in shoe boxes in brazil . It was quite different in this slum rehabilitation case , because there people were forced to move into the slums because they lost employment and because of that they had"
Environment, to use whatever informal materials they had to create a housing and that 's again problem with the material characteristics . They do n't have access to formal electricity and that that 's the whole climate change is
No," for 24 hours . So that creates again a very strong economic burden and also with this load shedding their appliances are getting damaged a lot and that 's again , a problem with mobility , because"
Environment, this slum rehabilitation housing are far from the city center . So even a repairing of appliance means you have to leave your whole day wage and go to repair shop and repair it and come back so it . It creates a very strong problem
Environment," of distribution right from the distribution company to how people are interacting with the energy and the built environment of this place . So now , what i am doing with the international energy agency is using"
Environment," these methods of natural language , processing or public deliberations in large scale to inform some of the problems with system integration of renewables . So we know that renewable energy is a solution both for climate and for"
Environment, bottom of the pyramid . So this this creates a kind of a climate based dialogue that either we we have the solution . But now it comes for how do we fix it or how do we kind of
No," whether you could reflect in particular on on this question about um either has covid impacted the dynamics that you 're talking about in particular ways and then ? Secondly , are there things we"
Environment," can learn from in the places that you 're working in terms of covert response ? That might shed light on this broader question that we 're debating today , which is around climate and health , and how could"
No," was announced overnight . Um thousands and thousands of marriages took place in a further hushhush manner than they did earlier . I mean you know , because in terms of even child marriages in these areas"
Environment," , um , you know right now . The expenditures actually came down when it came to organizing - and you know , managing these marriages , so it was done at home . It was done in like complete safety of home and uh . In the absence of you know any"
Environment," in terms of lessons . Yes , i think it is . Firstly , it is a big reminder in the sense that you know , i think both conversations on covet 19 , as well as climate change are taking place , have to take place simultaneously , because"
Environment," what overt did was actually bring to the fore . What climate change has been doing and will continue to do in terms of its social , economic and ecological implications , so in that sense i think it 's been an important reminder right now in terms of"
No," just child marriages which i 'm focusing on and migration . One of the things is : the government has actually set up committees , whether it 's you know , an immediate response to the night covenant pandemic"
No," in which people Live and work office , buildings that used to be busy and full are lying empty , and i think that obviously has impacts for uh questions that people in your world must be thinking about"
Environment, about the future of the ways in which people will work when we emerge out Of the crisis and That potentially offers both a challenge and maybe an opportunity if the density of occupation is going to change . If there are projections about the ways in
Environment," buildings as potential overheating risk um spaces that we need to include in the building code , whereas residential buildings were never part of the discussions in tropical climate and and that 's one of the key items that is coming on"
No," lack of open space , is not just a concern around your your physical health , but also has serious implications for things . Like mental health and mental wellbeing , i just wondered whether any of your narratives kind of revealed"
No," evidence of that coming through from your work . Yeah , absolutely i mean it . It has been one of a very big problem , even uh before covid , because the whole social network is broken when they are moved to this kind of social housing or"
No," public housing , so that creates anyway , a strong problem in terms of mental wellbeing and again there is A very strong , indirect energy connection : it 's because these buildings are 10 story high and the lifts do n't work because people"
No," there is no energy infrastructure to power the services . So , since people who live in 10th floor , they ca n't come down to first floor every now and then because of lack of such"
No," essential services , which are often overlooked . And that creates a very big problem in terms of again disintegrating the social network and with kovid . And it became a very big problem in terms of even mental health pandemic"
No," , because now people are restricted to so a peop . A family of six now live in a 24 meter square home and there are heat implications because at the same time there were huge heat waves , especially in mumbai and in rio de janeiro ."
No," has a multiple mental health impact and especially for children as well , so my study itself has shown that people have doubled their time spent in watching tv or mobile phones , and that has a"
Environment," to you on this particular question , uh , you know your work and your presentation highlighted very clearly that you know questions around uh . Climate change and health links are now beginning at least to"
Environment," say to that kim . I think that , historically , the focus on climate change and health has been mostly on physical health and that there is an increasing recognition of mental wellbeing as well , but it is still something that is very"
Environment," introducing mental health is an important factor to consider when we talk about the climate change impact , because of course we know that climate change is especially impacting young children because they are afraid of . What 'S gon na"
Environment," what lessons we can learn from graphic 19 for climate change policy , because i think that what is really important . What we have seen this year is that uh coffee 19 has really been a reminder of this intimate"
Environment," relationship between people and and the planets , and we have seen , for example , that climate change can also increase the likelihood of government type endemics in the future . For example , through changes in habitat of"
No," policies . If decision making is transparent , evidencebased and inclusive , and it has a clear aim of protecting their health and their families and their livelihoods , and i think that this is one of the"
Environment," lessons that we should learn when we 're talking about climate change policies as well , because by Talking about health , and by talking about something that is personal to people , it is about their families about themselves . It is about"
Environment," interest in economic uh factors , then i will frame my measures around the economic implications of climate change , whereas , as the person has more interest in health , i will frame it around Health implications , and in that way , i"
Environment," institutions and local structures , because uh , one of the key uh drivers of climate change , which connects is the Absence and lack of access to structural uh infrastructures , which in a way , can actually"
Environment," which must be provided by the state are certain aspects which will help in coping with the crisis and engaging better . And finally , i think you know in the whole discourse around climate change and gender . We do look largely at women and girls as"
Environment," victims . There 'S this whole lens of marginalization but at the same time , some of the biggest climate change activism movements have been led by women and girls globally and even by indigenous communities . So i"
Environment," science policy practice space needs a little bit Of more nuanced um , education or a subject , that 's developed particularly to it , because i i currently made a decision to exist both as a scientist as a policy maker as a parttime public"
Environment," three exist in different um . They have different domains to them , so science has is in the domain of information generation . We have a lot of scientific information on climate change and the problems that"
No," scientific information to beneficiaries , interests and Goals and values , and a very structured way to present scientific information that aligns to different governance structures and institutional structures"
No," If you talk to someone that has recently moved, started in your job, or retired, and ask them what they miss most about their past situation. One of the most common answers is that they miss the people that were in their life. What that actually means is that they miss the social connection, or relationship that they had with those people. Social connections or social interactions with other individuals is crucial to mental health, which in turn is crucial to overall health. The lack of social connections has shown to increase stress hormones, weaken the immune system, and lessen cardiovascular function. People who are lonely tend to consume"
Environment," more alcohol, exercise less, have less quality sleep, and fatigue easily. Social relationships allow you to share your achievements, and have support when times are tough. Imagine achieving a longterm goal you have, what's the first thing you want to do, tell someone of course. Or, imagine if something terrible happened, not having someone to lean on and talk to can make that event linger and make you feel even more isolated. Giving support in relationships can actually be more beneficial than receiving support. When someone shares something positive in their life with you, it's a compliment, they wanted you to be a part of their success, and they know that"
No," the immune system and erode physical health. Dealing with stress from a poor relationship can lead to over consuming food or alcohol, smoking, or taking medications to deal with the stress, which in turn can damage systems in the body. Connections through social media can be beneficial by allowing you to stay in touch with friends and family, however, social media connections are not a good alternative for facetoface in person contact, too much time spent on social media can lead to more isolation and a greater feeling of loneliness. It's a good practice to use social media in moderation. To be healthy we need people in our lives, it doesn't need to be 5,000 Facebook"
No," friends, and we don't have to have everyone like us. Having strong social relationships with just a few people is fine, a few people that we can share life's good and bad moments with, a few people that we can connect with on a regular basis, with no stress, and no judgement. A few people who accept us for who we are. Surround yourself with good people folks. Good people."
Environment," practice , rehabilitation and the medical legal process , which is in association with remote rehab , who have marketed this presentation today . Um"
Environment," go through the overview and aims for the presentation today , the the webinars seek to recover to cover the um rehabilitation needs being addressed in the nhs and , secondly , whether the society , rehabilitation , medicine guides"
Environment," , an interface of rehabilitation and medical legal process , we 'll be covering the rehabilitation Code and also the serious injury code , and also the importance of interim payments and access to early specialist"
Environment," legal advice and then dr julie harris will be covering the areas in terms of access to medical treatment and major trauma . Centers and also access to rehabilitation , prescriptions and specialist"
Environment, rehabilitation prescriptions so starting off um in terms of the rehabilitation definition um . The rehabilitation definition according to the bsrm is a process of assessment treatment and
No," management with ongoing evaluation , by which the individual and , of course , their families and carers are supported to achieve their maximum potential for physical , cognitive , social and psychological function . Participation in society and quality of"
Environment," living , so specialist rehabilitation is the total active care of patients with complex disabilities by a multidisciplinary team who undergone recognized , specialist training , rehabilitation led and all are supported"
Environment," by consultant , trained and accredited in rehabilitation medicine . So there 's evidence normally taken that there 's , obviously a now substantial body of trial based evidence and other research to support both the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of"
Environment," specialist rehabilitation . And despite the longer length of stay , the cost of providing early specialist reputation for patients with complex needs is rapidly offset by longerterm savings and the cost of community care and making the highly cost efficient"
Environment," intervention . So the importance of rehabilitation in terms of the medical legal process is clearly shown and something that um , obviously as us as lawyers need to engage with . So , just looking at the um , the national"
Environment," clinical order for specialist rehabilitation , so that in kazuri report , which was published back in april 2019 , this showed um . If a group of 1 381 individuals assessed as a requiring specialist rehabilitation , only 40 percent actually"
No," received it , and the report went on to establish that uh becoming more independent in activities of daily living , which in turn reduced the cost of ongoing care by an average of 536 pounds per week"
Environment," clearly that there are clear indications following on from this report , that there is a clear need for rehabilitation , access to rehabilitation and unfortunately , not all of that is available on the nhs at the present moment in time ."
Environment," And therefore , this shows that there 's a clearly a need for access to rehabilitation for patients and if the medical legal process can provide additional support , then clearly we need to try and address that"
No," so taking some um statistics , that 's in terms of acquired brain injury and an Area that i 'm particularly involved with with the uk acquired brain energy forum , and this one of three of us was in an acquired brain injury in our lifetime"
Environment," be made in terms of access to early access to specialist rehabilitation services . If that that service was provided and that 's in terms of obviously lost work contributions , and , obviously in terms of health and social care , in particular , the"
Environment," care care requirements for these individuals in the longer term , if the specialist rehabilitation is n't provided and also just to just to Make the point that , in terms of children in particular there , there is"
No," also some some study . Obviously , the report from the children 's commissioner back in october 2012 indicated that in terms of traumatic brain injury , as opposed to other conditions such as autism and adhd and learning disabilities , you can see"
Environment," that the percentages of those children with with a traumatic brain , injury and dwarf These figures , and indeed that does show the size of potentially the the issue in terms of access to rehabilitation , not just for adults , but also for children as well"
Environment," , so taking that forward and in terms of the um , the british society rehabilitation , medicine guide . This was published back in 2006 . This is a guide to best practice of the interface between rehabilitation , the medical legal process ."
Environment," This was um developed with input from the british society , rehabilitation , medicine , world , cultural decisions , dissociation of personal injury lawyers at april and the form of insurance lawyers , foil um , and this was sought to address the"
Environment," confusion , often caused by a process of implementing medical legal recommendations and Further rehabilitation in the medical legal process - and this provides some guidance and"
Environment," some best practice in terms of an interface between the nhs rehabilitation services and the medical legal process , to try and make sure that the patient and their outcomes are optimized wherever possible . This took into account that both"
No," The first point was in terms of the guidance during nhs treatment . So so , whilst the patient is undergoing uh ongoing nhs treatment and then it was important that the recommendations made by any party involved in a compensation process so within litigation"
No, or by the medical or the experts should be referred back to the nhs specialist for consideration . That should be given that information and to to assist with their ongoing treatment through the nhs where additional alternative treatment is
No," proposed . Um , obviously myself as a claimant solicitor , should inform the mhs specialist who would advise as to whether such additional or alternative treatments like to be reasonable , beneficial or in the best interests of the claimant"
No," type and location of the facility used with delivery of that additional treatment , and the response of the nhs investors should should then be communicated to the claimant as the Patient , so that they can make an informed decision"
No," and subject to the claimant 's consent . That decision and the information provided to the claimant um would then be communicated to the insurer or compensator , with a view to seeking an interim payment of damages to fund that treatment privately . Wherever"
Environment," possible , funding also may be secured through the compensation process to provide a range of support services for the claimant , and this will often include personal care . It 'S equipment , transport and housing , and obviously that is subject to"
Environment," make sure that that there is that interferes between the two processes and also in terms of discharge planning , ongoing health and social care assessments undertaken through the nhs and Staff services"
Environment," , the rehabilitation prescription which will come on To reference later on , so wherever decision is made to seek a separate assessment of rehabilitation needs um , whether that 's under the rehabilitation code which i 'll come on to today within the in a second"
Environment," um , with a view to considering additional alternative rehabilitation treatment . Such decision should only be made after proper full consultation with the nhs specialist . Now again , that 's important . It is important , particularly if ongoing treatment is being"
Environment," process , then the clinical case manager should then consult with the nhs rehabilitation specialist and , if appropriate , obviously with ourselves a solicitor , a payment solicitor and subject to The claimant 's"
No," consent for defendants , your insurer , to make sure that there 's an agreement going forward in terms of recommendations uh in terms of ongoing treatment , but again that that that should be um . The payment should be informed and the"
No," patient should be informed of that process and to what extent this nhs team has contributed to those recommendations , there 's also duties of confidentially confidentiality , which do exist in relation to the claimant 's treatment at all times , and it must be respected . So to"
Environment," ensure that information concerning them is not disclosed to the third parties without the claimant 's written consent , so the patient must consent to their information being provided . If the claim agrees to undergo private rehabilitation treatment with the"
Environment," support approval of the nhs specialist rehabilitation team and then the nhs questions should retain overall clinical responsibility until such time as the claimant is discharged from nhs treatment again , the the the"
No," It would be normal practice for the clinical responsibility to transfer . However , uh to an appropriate qualified medical practitioner at the private facility , once transfer is complete and if therapy or the treatment is provided to the client in the community"
Environment," , then often the nhs specialist may wish to review the benefit of such treatment from time to time . Uh that nhs specialist may wish to give advice and guidance on such private rehabilitation treatment treatment in the future , in conjunction with the"
No," claimant 's , gp and clinicians involved in delivery of private treatment and but it but again in terms of overall clinical responsibility once that discharge takes Place then often a a consultant will take over that responsibility and , overall"
Environment," and in the circumstances where the claim wishes to receive private rehabilitation , treatment outside of the nhs and the nhs specialist or rehabilitation team disagree with the proposal being made , then the ultimate decision should rest With with the with the patient , the"
No," claimant themselves obviously subject to the provisions of the mental capacity access as often the the claimants that we deal with do have capacity issues in terms of treatment and but obviously under the medical capacity act . Um , obviously that"
Environment," consider the advice received from the nhs specialist and rehabilitation team , and then , if there was a conflict that did arise , it would be desirable that the nhs specialists should be able to consult with the private specialist directly in Order that , if possible , a"
No," the benefits of the clients and their outcomes are optimized . So moving on to when a claimant is discharged from their nhs service . So when , when a claimant has been discharged from treatment under the nhs and further treatment is recommended by"
Environment," there is somebody taking over that clinical responsibility for management of the treatment programs and and then again , um . We may need to get additional advice from the nhs specialist , the rehabilitation team , or"
Environment," indeed the gp . In terms of ongoing treatment thereafter , if the claim requests his solicitor to to arrange private rehabilitation treatment , then again , the sister should satisfy themselves that such treatment will be"
Environment, treatment and again just uh to make the point in terms of records in the course of claremont 's private rehabilitation treatment . These are subject to the normal rules for cost confidentiality and should only be disclosed to third
Environment," rehabilitation potential and and thus improve quality of life um . But in terms of in terms of the party involved in the compensation process and receiving an expert comment , um , obviously that must"
Environment," may well assist the nhs specificial rehabilitation team with the provision of treatment and then obviously subject to the consent of the payment . We would often disclose that evidence to the nhs teams and there after that , correspondent"
Environment," , that that that those documents are normally provided to you into the rehabilitation code , unless the parties both agree that that document is disposable , then it would n't normally perform part of The"
No," in draft and then being in a position to disclose it to the people . The the obviously teams that are providing treatment and it 's important to have that distinction . In appropriate cases , the parties may"
No," also ask a medical legal accident to contact development , nhs specialists , and i have a number of occasions where this happened . In the cases i 've dealt with in order to discuss , recommendations , natural treatment and again , it is uh important that"
No," communication is , is an important process of part of the process . And i know any such communication would normally be retained on the treatment record so that that is"
Environment," again something to be aware of and again it 's good practice for for the solicitor or medical legal expert to inform the nhs rehabilitation team , any medical legal assessments and so For example , in terms of a"
No," clinical treatment . There are . There are , however , some times when um . If the the area in question is um quite a specialist area - and"
No," there is a lack of um particular specialisms , in particular experts in that area , then i i have on occasion ask that medical legal expert to have some further part to play in terms of clinical Treatment , an"
No," locally . Then i may have may ask them to provide some some assistance in terms of the ongoing treatment in that regard by going forwards . Um . But but again that 's that 's a fairly rare in in my experience in certain senses , whether medical , legal"
Environment," expert or clinical specialist , either in the nhs or private sector , should make a recommendation for rehabilitation services to be provided . Then obviously , that particular rehabilitation , facility or providers must declare any interest or"
Environment," evidence to make sure that it 's fully independent , so moving on . In terms of um nhs assessments , so so again um those assessments carried out by the nhs rehabilitation team as part of that nhs rehabilitation process"
Environment," will often inform and help the medical legal experts in preventing their reports . I'Ve given examples of discharge , summaries and rehabilitation prescriptions . These are really important documents and need to be provided to to the the experts , alongside all of the"
Environment, available from various different trusts . Whilst the agreement is on underground treatment and that can often be a difficult jigsaw to pull together and when the claimant is continuing to undergo rehabilitation . The care of the nhs rehabilitation specialist is often
Environment, very helpful to the parties in developing an understanding of the clinical issues and claims rehabilitation needs for their nhs rehabilitation specialists to be instructed by preliminary assessment report
No," and again sometimes that might play a play . A role in terms of providing a summary of what that the treatment has been um to that point and whenever an nhs within specialists is requested and by ourselves , as"
No," claimant solicitors or by the parties joining me to produce a report that would normally be being prepared . And there was a treatment anyway , but such a report would not form part of the claims medical records that would be subject to the rules of"
Environment," rehabilitation code . Now the rehabilitation code is a code that has been established between claimant lawyer organizations and also um the insurer organizations themselves and , and we as solicitors , sign up to the"
Environment," rehabilitation code to ensure that there is a joint duty to consider the rehabilitation needs of an injured . Claimant and the reputation code was set up to try and ensure that , in terms of the personal"
Environment," so that so again the reputation code is , is a tool to try and ensure that rehabilitation is provided as an early possible possible stage , where there 's no agreement on liability where and again that can often be"
Environment," some time before liability is fully established . Parties may still agree to use the rehabilitation code and there 's been many cases that i 've been involved with , where um insurers have agreed to pay make"
No," without prejudice insurance payments to pay for um for items , whether that 's for items or equipment , treatment , support , case management um or In some time , some occasions"
Environment," , accommodation and all of these things that need to be addressed - the health and social health and the economic benefits of proceeding with the rehabilitation of an early stage , regardless an agreement on liability may"
Environment," that be especially strong in serious cases . So so there is often a financial benefit to the compensators themselves by providing providing some some access to rehabilitation at an early stage and again , that 's sometimes"
Environment," um beneficial for them also . Although the rehabilitation code deals mainly with provision for an immediate needs assessment and again that 's an independent , immediate need assessment , it 's often prepared by case managers in particular , it encourages all parties"
Environment, a lot in terms of access to rehabilitation um in terms of the serious injury guide . This is a guide that was established to deal with the claims of um on a full liability basis of 250 000 pounds or both in terms of evaluation of
Environment," rehabilitation and but also make sure that they are fully up to speed . As as to how things are moving forward with the litigation itself , liability matters often resolved where possible , within six"
Environment," rehabilitation . Again , that is enshrined in the surgical to ensure that there will be an appointment where possible , of an independent clinical case manager to uh , which would not be instructed by the commandment to to address the clinical need for"
Environment," rehabilitation . And there are some occasions where a place manager would be appointed on a joint basis . But i have to say that they are fairly rare and would normally only be in cases where , where there are severe liability issues"
Environment," and whereby there might be some benefit to the claimant , to have a jointly instructed case manager on the basis of the rehabilitation code . Um . Because there will be 100 funding for that defendants , um will often make early and continuing campaigns as part of the"
Environment," records and information . So that 's a quick run through of the bsr called the information uh relating to um , the serious injury code and rehabilitation called"
Environment," very active way , having moved back to the uk from canada in 2008 , there 's a bit of relevance to that too , because having trained in north america um . I completed my board exams in rehabilitation , medicine , physical medicine and rehab"
No," the relative risks and benefits of scoop and run versus stay and play now i 'll get to that in a second but um until about 10 years ago , it was general practice in"
Environment," trauma center and , additionally , i believe i was effective in embedding the role of rehabilitation medicine within the clinical care pathway , and i believe one of the successes in that process was to"
Environment," establish that A patient had to be assessed by a rehabilitation , medicine consultant within three days of admission to a major trauma center that has n't always proven to be possible as some major trauma centers , do n't even have a rehab medicine consultant"
Environment," , um and in the uk , more than half of major traumas caused by road traffic accidents . That 'S typical actually of most developed nations . The us is now a liar because , of course , the us is a heavily armed civilian population who have a habit of shooting"
Environment," each other but other than um gunshot injuries in the uk and the us . That 'S also the case there that road traffic accidents are a major contributor uh . There are a couple of things that have changed in the past uh few years , uh more in the developed nations rather"
No," and it is intended to serve a population from the roadside to discharge back into the community And then , ultimately , community rehab , it 's intended to be a pathway that"
No," rapidly uh sees a patient to the best place where they can be managed with the most appropriate care um and that , ideally being local as local as possible . The families are engaged as well ."
Environment," A network is expected to provide a comprehensive rehabilitation prescription and within that prescription . Uh the patient 's prehospital history , um and their posthospital phases of rehabilitation and recovery are expected"
No," to be considered um . The rest of the questions around networks are based around uh , whether the uh the network has a properly functioning major trauma center , which has negotiated"
No," healthy relationships with major trauma units and whether the main trauma center and the units have negotiated healthy relations with community rehab services . Beyond that , i 'd add that um , the major"
No," trauma center uh as an nhs facility and the units and other community services again as nhs services need also to nurture healthy relationships with the private sector as well um through , for example"
Environment," stabilized and suitable for discharge , either to a less intensive hospital environment all back to the community . Under the guidance of a rehabilitation , medicine consultant who would have seen that person within three days , so where will they go then having"
No," , particularly well and there 's a second cohort of patients who are older , who may not do as well in a major trauma center , as one would hope . So , whilst the majority of patients who come through major trauma"
No," , centers are adults and there is a preponderance of relatively young male adults , because young male adults do stupid things on saturday nights involving cars and alcohol . There are two other peaks and that would"
No," be children and the elderly and , as i said , those two other peaks are n't as well considered as the uh , otherwise preinjury healthy young adults . Uh , patient outcomes were known to be worse in the uk for"
No," these patients having suffered a major trauma uh when comparisons were made with outcomes in other uh western economies . In 2010 , uh audits revealed that we were delivering poor outcomes when it came to mortality and mobility , and questions were raised as to why that"
No," civilians at the roadside and assessed by the ambulance staff at the scene . The ambulance staff will then wisely would hope , recognize the severity of their injuries and triage them straight to the major trauma center . If it 's safe to do so , and"
No," , diagnostically and in terms of clinical treatment . We know , then , that um , having used major trauma , centers and established them properly . There has been a reduction in death now these numbers are pretty uh convincing . I"
Environment," rehabilitation services - and this is on principally on the back of the rehabilitation prescription . Now , let 's kill the slice , i 'm going to just cover a couple of little um obstacles here to understanding what the"
Environment," rehabilitation prescription consists of , because there are just a few uh designations within the rehab prescription that are confusing . Anyway , it 's used"
Environment," to triage a patient to the right level of rehabilitation , there 's no particular template for a rehab prescription . So you might be surprised to learn that each ccg , each major trauma network which owns its regional"
Environment," rehabilitation program if any , but even if that 's the case , if only a level three facility is required , that needs to be made clear on the rehab prescription , so the um , the specialist area here , is when the patient Requires level one or"
No," assistants and their family members before having had a brief discharge going home . Okay , that 's very straightforward that describes levels according to levels , one two , a two b and three as you see on that slide ."
No," of the service is within a unit , the more likely that unit is to be level one or two a. I hope that 's clear , but it is sometimes even confusing to many clinicians with whom i 've worked . It 'S a very poor way of doing things , okay"
No," into rehab , which may be in this case a level Three and then from there on to outpatient services and then into the community with integrated care planning and at any point along this"
No," community services can communicating with other doctors , other consultants and then ultimately seeing the patient 's discharge to the community with the best care and therapies they require ."
No," Okay . So i hope that 's covered um , the major trauma center unit and its purpose , the rehab prescription and its purpose , and more generally , i"
No," hope i 've left you with a sense as to the value of having instituted this change in the past 10 or so years that it Has now objectively been measured , it has resulted in fewer deaths . Ultimately , it 's resulted in more people getting back to a high quality of life"
Environment," that the team members in what is certainly by definition in rehabilitation , medicine , a team approach . It stands or falls on good communication between all the participants from the very beginning , at uh . During the assessment"
No," uh ago , at the roadside , until a patient is trying to get back to work and trying to get back on their feet in the community every step along the way , communication has always been the most important feature of a successful outcome ."
Environment," The answer to that is that we know the most about aerobic exercise that is exercised . It increases your heart rate . We know the most about the positive effects of that there 's a little bit of evidence that strength . Training can also be positive , but there 's not as much"
Environment," , but I will qualify that by face . But it really depends where you start from it 's not like . If you have no activity at all that , you suddenly have to increase to three times a week immediately , if you get those effects or if you already have a good exercise routine , you might have"
Environment, to increase that even more to get the maximum benefits . The other key question : what time of day is critical early morning first thing in the morning exercise is beneficial because it is increasing all those neurotransmitters all those growth factors at a time right
Environment," before you need to use your brain to learn and remember so contrast that , With end of the day exercise you can still benefit from that , but you 're not required to use your brain most of us after we go home after a workout , so my recommendation is always"
Environment, to maximize the effects of exercise for your daily cognitive functions . Do it first thing in the morning.
Environment," As your weight goes up , the size of your brain goes down . It 'S like , oh , my God . If 70 of us are overweight , it 's the biggest brain drain in the history of the United States . In fact , it 's a national security crisis because they 're not letting as many not as many people are eligible to"
No," sign up for military service , because we just have an unhealthy population . Talk to me about diets impact on that . What are some main sort of ballpark things ? You should be pulling out , you know it 's not hard and again , if I"
No," vegetables , the better the one misnomer people often have is . Oh , I should go on a lowfat diet . The problem with that is , sixty percent of the solid weight of your brain is fat and low fat diets can actually trigger depression , and so I like healthy fat fish , although"
Environment," , your brain likes it because it feels happier it feels more relaxed now the problem is , it kills you orally , and so you have to sort of take us , but you know the other thing that drives tryptophan into the Brain is exercise and so and many of my athletes they exercise"
No," flow . Is I would give all children , social media and video games and encourage them to play as much as they could , because that would drop blood flow to"
Environment," their brain brand . New study , the more screen time , the smaller the brain ? That 'S a little horrifying ! Well , one they 're ! Not going outside they 're not getting exercise they 're , not getting the sun , we have a massive deficiency of vitamin D in this country and exercise increases"
No," basically have fast food restaurants . The G is genetics um and I do n't know what you have in your family and mine . I have heart disease and obesity obesity in a big way in my family yeah . But as you we can see , genes"
No," are not a death sentence , they should be a wakeup call to do the right things to decrease your genetic vulnerability . So if I was the evil ruler , I would go . You have obesity in your family . I do a public campaign , so it 's in your family . Why worry about"
Environment," of a horse and had no frontal lobe function . The tea is toxins . So if I was the evil ruler , I would get rid of all of the Environmental Protection . So that we are filled with air pollution , water pollution - and I would never , I would tell the manufacturers they do n't - have to put"
No," , goes on . Your body goes in your body . Becomes your body um I 'd ! Think of alcohol as a health . Food we 've certainly had that craze . I would legalize not only legalize marijuana , but it 's like , let 's not say it 's good for us , because all of my published research"
No," says it 's bad . That now does that mean if someone 's dying of cancer and it 'll help their pain and help the nausea and help them eat ? God bless them right , I mean so , let 's be rational about it . I just saw someone had been smoking pot for 50 years and his brain was remarkably older"
No," than he was um . The m is mental health and , if I was the evil ruler , I 'd create CNN and Fox News and that it ruins People 's Health because they always lead with negative . They increase anger and frustration and polarization the more you 're exposed to"
No," it . The anger you get and the more it separates you from other people . The eye is immunity and infections . I would belittle people who were testing patients for Lyme disease . My great stories are patients who have Lyme one girl , she 's 16 . She became psychotic"
Environment," , it 's the biggest brain drain in the history of the United States . In fact , it 's a national security crisis because they 're not letting as many not as many people are eligible to sign up for military service , because we just have an unhealthy population . And if I was an"
No," evil ruler , I would create screens that have blue lights because they disrupt sleep uh , because the s in bright Minds asleep . So there 's so many things happening that I 'm just it gives me pause about the society we 're raising our babies and"
No," grandbabies in . I was going to say a lot of what you 're describing sounds like what we 're encountering every day . So , if that 's the way to really mess people up , then what is the lifestyle that is going to help us supercharge ? So you talked about sleep"
Environment," um , where , where should we be at ? How much sleep are we talking about ? Does time of day matter like um and not just sleep ? What is the idealized lifestyle ? So if we just go back through those bright Minds , risk factors so with blood flow ? It 'S exercise"
Environment," simple supplements like Ginkgo and vinpocetine boost blood flow to the brain , simple foods like beets or cayenne , pepper , Rosemary , so they 're dietary things . You can do their lifestyle things exercises you 've said that I thought was really interesting is what happens in"
No," enhance your performance , because your mood will be better and I 'm always thinking what I do for you . How is that going to affect your partner right ? Because I never think of myself as your psychiatrist . I always think of myself as your families psychiatrists , because I"
Environment, see little kids and old people and everybody in between so exercise so for retirement and aging . I want you working in a job that you 're passionate about that you 're purposeful with and if you 're not and some people just are n't it 's . What are you doing for
No," new learning every day ? What do you do for new learning every day ? Is it all around the brain , or do you have stuff outside of that ? No , in fact it should n't be like I know how to read brain scans . Just reading more scams does n't really help my brains pattern recognition . So I"
No," um keto is the only thing in my life that had a a druglike effect when I tried it , I had suffered from inflammation for like 15 years . I was icing my wrist every night because they just hurt and just to keep them in check , but I was n't doing any fat in my diet . I"
No," , I 'm a fan of it for neurodegenerative diseases and for seizures . In fact , I have a granddaughter who has a wicked seizure disorder and on a ketogenic diet . She lost her seizures . That 'S actually one of my passion stories , because when I suggested it she 's five months old , she 's"
No," having 160 seizures a day and on the diet , she 'll astral seizures , but the reason I 'm not a fan in general is there 's not enough . Colorful plants and plants have medicine so for your pain , it may have been dairy or it may have been gluten or it may have been"
No," corn or it may have been soy . Those things that tend to go away on a ketogenic diet . It could have been one of those things as well , that was driving the inflammation , because a lot of people would argue that meat can drive inflammation as well , and the first thing"
No," I do with almost all of my patients that are n't getting better is I put them On an Elimination , Diet - and I have to tell you the nutritionists in my clinics - they have more success stories than the sciatrists . So one story , I had a guy that was severely depressed . He had ECT"
No," Hospital electric shock therapy , he had been hospitalized multiple times . He was suicidal , he said to me he said you 're . My last hope I get that a lot . That 'S a little bit stressful for making um and I 'm like nothing 's worked . I want you"
No," to try an Elimination Diet he 's like do . I have to I 'm like really . Yes , you have to , and so what does that mean no gluten ? No Dairy um kill the sugar , no corn , no soy , no artificial dyes or preservatives he 's , like that 's my whole diet"
No," mouth whoa , I 'm like we have to break up with corn and his depression has not come back wow . That 'S crazy ! That is n't that crazy ! Yeah - and I mean I should be used to that at this point - like the number of people"
No," that have that kind of reaction to a specific type of food and how variable it is meaning , maybe corn for me , is fine , but for him is absolutely catastrophic . Um and how much variability do you see um ? How do you , because an Elimination Diet can be very confusing for people ?"
No," have control over that , do I love this , and does it love me back , I 'm not going to be in love with something that hurts me . I did The Daniel Plan . Pastor , Rick Warren called me up and said : I 'm fat , my church is fat . Will you help me ? We created a program uh for them Mark Hyman"
No," and I did and thousands of churches around the world had done it . It 'S awesome , but one of the pastor 's wives came into my office and she said I told my husband last night after you gave a lecture that I 'd rather get Alzheimer 's disease than give up sugar wow ."
No," I 'M like did you date , The Bad Boys in high school , because that 's a bad relationship . Wow and later we found out she has a family history of Alzheimer 's and she 's given up sugar , but the insanity around food is is crazy . Did that that like actually makes me"
No," it 's only me , there are people watching this that either they need to change , or maybe more importantly , someone , they love needs to change , and they just do n't know how to help them . Well , if you want to help someone else , and my dad 's story is a great story , you have to live the"
Environment," think is Bad Medicine um . So the first thing is , you have to live it and then you have to find smart ways to get them interested . So I start and exercise with all of my patients called The onepage Miracle , so on one piece of paper , I want you to write out"
No," , because I realize Nobody Does it because they should do it um , but they 're more likely to do it if it fits if it 's their goal . So I want to live a long time because I love my mission . I love my wife . I love my kids . I love my grandkids , so you have to"
No," huge benefit . I have pictures you know . Thirty percent of the brain is dedicated to vision , and so I can show you here 's a healthy scan . Here 'S your scan , I 'm sort of hoping you 'll , get some anxiety over it right ramp up your anxiety , so you do better ! That 'S what I 've seen I had this"
No," one guy from the valley came to see me and he was really his wife was concerned . He was really depressed and his brain looked like he had Alzheimer 's disease and I 'm like how much do you drink and he 's like I 'm never drunk , I 'm like that 's , not the question . How much do you"
Environment," happiness to just drink that in one . Why is that important and then two ? How do we actually do that ? Well , in my new book , um feel better fast and make it last , which I 'm really excited about , is there 's an exercise and feel better fast . It 'S about flooding all five of your"
No," to it , and it makes Me happy because it triggers happy memories for me : um listening to sounds of nature like the rain or the ocean , or certain music like for me . It 'S Good Vibrations from The Beach Boys um . What are the scents ? What are the"
No," touches ? What are the tastes ? The smells that can trigger happiness , so vanilla of all things , honeysuckle Jasmine , have been found in scientific studies to trigger happiness , see . I actually think we carry memories from other people uh genetically in the book . You talk"
No," East , came to Los Angeles . His brother , who was a bad driver , borrowed his sister 's car and was killed in a train accident and he 's 19 . My grandfather never drove because that anxiety got solidified in his brain , and that happened before he was involved in making my father and so"
No," the anxiety . I carry may not just be mine that it may actually come from the experiences of generations that I think a lot of it did n't start with me um , and so we know . For example , children of Holocaust Survivors have a higher incidence of PTSD 30 percent of children ."
No," Of soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan , who had PTSD 30 percent of their children had PTSD , they call it secondary PTSD , and so I think of these as ancestral Dragons . It 'S like what 's the issue that actually may not be your issue , and so I think it 's really"
No," important for you to know about your mom and your grandma and your grandfather on her side and your dad and their ancestors , because it 's not just the genes we inherit . It 'S the scratches on them that turn on or off those genes that make anxiety , depression"
No," , much more common in future Generations . So , for example , the end of mental illness is dedicated to my two nieces Amelie and Alize they 're , 10 and 15 , and they have mental illness throughout their whole family , family , history of suicides , multiple"
No," suicides , anxiety , depression , bipolar disorder , addiction , borderline personality , criminal Behavior , but genes only load . The gun , it 's what happens to us that pulls the trigger and unfortunately , they were raised in chaos with"
No," parents who suffered with depression , addiction , domestic violence . They had multiple moves , and so the whole idea behind the end of mental illness is how do I end it in these girls and in their babies and grandbabies , and what you do is you put their bodies and their brain"
Environment," in a healing environment ? So we work on the actual physical functioning of their bodies and um Alize . When I scanned her at 13 , her brain looked terrible and was that because her mom drank when she was pregnant , was it because they lived in a"
No," friend back to today 's episode , so what are the the sort of Baseline things ? We do you talk about diet in the book not being addicted to Flaming Cheetos anymore ? What are some of the the things that you did to help them out ? So for Alize I mean first , it starts with"
Environment," mind will find well . Why is today going to be a great day ? I got to hang out with you , so that makes me happy at the end of the day , we always talk about well , what went ? Well , today , it 's training your mind , but also setting up your dreams to be more"
No," setting that intention before I go to bed would be better than what I 'm doing now , which is just sort of tumbling into bed and going to sleep . And it 's so cool because you 're probably like me and you 're just busy and you have a lot to do and you want to accomplish a lot and"
No," of control , write down what you 're thinking and then ask yourself if it 's true and there 's a whole process in the book to not believe every stupid thing you think and then , when you go to say Something to"
Environment," your wife or at work : does it fit ? There 'S an exercise actually , in all of my books , basically called the one page Miracle on one piece of paper : write down what you want your relationships , your work , your money"
No," , your physical , emotional , spiritual health . What do you want ? I think everything starts with . What do you want and then does your behavior get you what you want so , for example , with my wife , I want a kind , caring , loving , supportive , passionate"
No," Learning that you 're going to have to do is really pretty extraordinary . But if you 're not aiming that at the right thing , then you 're never going to make progress . And so everything you 're trying to accomplish in your life has to be so clear that it boils down to"
No," is an evil ruler strategy . It 'S yeah I mean they have bubble gum , flavor , vaping devices , that 's directed at children , hello , um . We need to be more thoughtful , talk to me more about toxins . So definitely"
No," obviously tobacco marijuana alcohol , like those are ones that I think most people . Although I love what you say , alcohol is not a health food , it 's not . I think that one may need to be said more , but there 's someone , I do n't think anybody thinks smoking is good for them . But what are"
No," bugs in your gut . If you 're damaging them well , we 've seen that goes with anxiety . One of the toxins people do n't know about , but clearly in the medical literature is anesthesia . Children who have anesthesia have a higher incidence of learning disabilities and add and"
No," may be extreme , but certainly they can do that , get their diet right . Sleep is going to be huge , ending any social , social isolation that you have connecting to people . What are some other ? Don'T be fat . That is straight to the point : do n't be fat"
No," friend , it stores toxins . So that 's one risk factor . It increases inflammation , that 's another risk factor . I published two studies that show , as your weight goes up , the blood flow to your brain goes down , which should scare the fat off anyone yeah"
No," Behavior you engage in you 're going to do again and so bad habits they get stuck in your brain . Just like good habits get stuck in your brain , so it just takes some retraining . So , for example , when I sit down at a restaurant and they come always , you want alcohol"
No," and they just drop bread on the table . So I 'm like no to the alcohol , because if you drink alcohol before a meal you 're actually going to order more food and you 're more likely to order dessert and no to the bread . Why ? Because it 's a simple carbohydrate that quickly turns"
No," in your mouth ! It starts . Turning to sugar and it boosts a chemical called serotonin in your brain , which makes you happy , but it drops your frontal lobes , making you more likely to order more and dessert , and so as soon as the waiter comes , I 'm like no on the alcohol alcohol"
No," dragons from the past that still breathe fire on your emotional brain . So I was doing a podcast with Dr Sharon May who 's a friend of mine , relational therapist , and she started talking about dragons from the past that were ruining relationships , and then she and I started"
No," - collaborating it 's like well , let 's identify the dragons and we came up with 13 of them and a couple the pandemic just exploded like the Death dragon or the grief and loss Dragon um , but my whole life . I was living with the invisible"
No," , abandoned or insignificant Dragon one of seven . I was in the middle , my second son in a Lebanese family , which means you 're Expendable , which turned out to be beautiful , because I did n't have to go on the grocery business right and Lebanese families , the"
No," oldest child , the oldest male child , goes in the business and is Your brother still in the business , my brother , is the president of the business wow . I do n't think I 'd ever heard . You talk , I mean your dad was really successful in the business that he built . I did n't realize"
No," just how much sort of I guess ended up . Not being familial pressure for you , but certainly would have been for your brother . Well , it 's pressure when you grew up with a dad , that 's very successful . He ended up being the chairman of the board of a four"
No," um . I actually have this video . I did a public television special on the new book and I actually showed the video of me when I 'm five playing with sugar insurers kissing me , and it was just beautiful . But sugar also liked my dad 's roses . And so one day"
No," sugar went off to the farm , which means sugar got slaughtered right and a couple of nights later , my dad and his brother were joking that they were feeding us sugar for dinner , which was incredibly traumatic for me and years later , were you at This point"
No," in the United States . Right and as I walked by , I got flooded with that memory and all of a sudden , I 'm 43 or something have a panic attack wow , because the past is always connected to the present , and so , if there 's trauma learning . How and I"
No, um and the Death Dragon sort of surprised me . But you know we did the study during covid and is it a fear of death ? It 'S the fear of death dragon and a lot of people have n't come to grips
Environment," there 's a lot of writing exercises in in the book , because I actually want people to write their story and give it the ending they want and then ask themselves every day . Then kick in your prefrontal . Cortex is my behavior getting me what I want , because too often people go for"
No," fixes that fail , rather than fixes that fix okay , so first we 're going to identify our Dragon okay , so I have the fear of death Reagan or I have the anxiety dragon as somebody Who suffered with the anxiety dragon that one 's very easy for"
No," me to relate to okay ? So I have the anxiety Dragon , I 'm obsessing about a future that I 'm practicing the failure unintentionally . This was my thing . I would find my what I thought of as exit ramps like if this situation becomes problematic . What 'S my exit ramp , but in"
No," thinking about all of my exit Rams , I was rehearsing it going wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong and when I 'm journaling the idea , I want to bring together with this . So I I identify my dragon , but now , when I 'm doing the"
No," journaling , how do I get to Accurate thinking ? Because the problem in the first place is that I have a cognitive distortion ? I have a a tendency to think of how the things could go wrong , or at least that felt like the right way to plan for the future . I'Ve since stopped"
No," doing that um . How do you recognize what accurate thinking actually is , and you go through this in the book , because you you have that , like four questions that you have people do , I think it was four and"
No," feel sad or mad or nervous or out of control , write out what you 're thinking and then it 's five questions , but it 's is it true ? Is it absolutely true with a hundred percent certainty and that 's the one that usually cracks it it 's like um"
No," I believe , I 'm worthless , dad withering sad lonely , and the fourth question is : who would I be without the thought or how would I feel if I did n't have the thought , the"
Environment," most common answer to that one is free And then you flip it around to the opposite . It 'S like , I am worth something or I have worked and then give me an example or two or three or four , and you have to do that - exercise at least a hundred"
No," I'Ll never be successful or I wo n't have enough money or my life has no meaning it 's like well , let 's put that under a microscope , not positive thinking , accurate thinking , okay , so putting myself in the shoes of somebody that 's trapped in one of these"
No," dragons , my gut instinct And you 've done this so much more than I have , but my gut instinct is the part that they 're going to struggle with the most is they 're going to say the opposite right . So I have worth I have value it just is n't going to feel true , or it 's going to feel"
No," true at such a low rung level like yes , okay , fine , I have some value , but Jesus is it enough to be worth everything that I 'm going through ? I find that people are so illequipped to accurately identify what their abilities are , their capabilities , their worth their value , all"
No," dragons have upsides ? My abandoned , invisible and insignificant Dragon had tremendous upside for me um . How do you tame it ? So it 's more than just correct your thinking to their strategy so for for one seeking"
No," significance . Well , that 's useful and it could be voluntary in a church it . You know , whatever fits your definition internally of significance and then I have meditations around each of them um"
No," and I 'm like I just want to look at the brain . What 'S your problem um and in 1996 I had the state of California 's Medical Board . Investigate me . Yeah . I'Ve never heard that before it 's crazy , that was traumatizing and I could n't sleep and one of the original"
No," EMDR trainers worked for me and I walked into Jennifer lendl 's office . In my clinic - and I 'm like , you need to help me after an hour of this treatment . I was absolutely fine . If they took my license from me , I could get a job . I could take care of my family . I was going to be fine"
No," , but you can just imagine : you 'd spend a big chunk of your life , trying to do what you do and now someone 's trying to take it away from you . Why does the lateral eye movement shift the brain so profoundly that you go from ? I ca n't sleep . This is a total mess to one"
No," bilateral hemisphere , stimulation so , for example , um off camera . We talked about how my dad died last year and a couple of days after he died um in a random stack of papers . I 'M at my"
No," mom 's house just helping her organize things is a picture of my dead dad in the mortuary and I 'm like what idiot , because it just bothered me - and I noticed it was just bothering me throughout the day . You know I 'd see the picture and I 'd be irritated and"
No," was pretty irritated by this and after I did it for 30 seconds , it 's like a four and then after I did it again . The irritation was gone . I did it two more times for 30 seconds and I fell in love with the picture because it was the last picture of my dad on Earth , and"
No," , I want to speculate about why that 's working so when I meditate what 's useful about meditation the only times that it works for me are when I can really lock into the Pleasure cycle of the breath , so I have to be thinking about optimizing the pleasure of each part of"
No," stops your brain from thinking about the traumatic thing . That 'S sort of bullet point one but bullet point two is that you fell in love with the photo , but let 's take these one at a time . Do you think , is it the bilateral activation of the brain ? That 'S"
No," Okay , so that all makes sense . Now , when I 'm stroking myself , I am recalling the memory I 'm activating bilaterally , my brain , I do n't understand why that breaks the elevation of the emotion . Why yeah and I 'm not sure we know why we"
No," by the medical board , but I do n't get freaked out . Do you tell yourself a new story , so you pull so one of the things I find Most Fascinating about memory . Is that every time you pull it into your working memory , you 're affecting it ? And so you can"
No," change the tenor of that memory . The emotional Resonance of that memory as you hold into working memory and then store it back . So as you 're doing this you 're doing the havening you 're or the bilateral eye movement or both you 're pulling the memory forward , are you"
No," hope they would that 's where the Imaging work I do becomes so helpful . What is up my friend Tom bilyu here , and I have a big question to ask you : how would you rate your level of personal discipline on a scale of one to ten ? If your answer is anything less than a 10 , I 've got"
No," push yourself to do the hard things that greatness is going to require of you right click . The link on the screen register for this class right now and let 's get to work . I will see you inside this Workshop from Impact Theory University . Until then , my friends be"
No," sensation is pleasant and therefore it paints that New emotion on an old memory , so part of it is skill . Um , my children get horrified . If I want to watch Pollyanna , one of my favorite movies ever Pollyanna teaches people to play the Glad game , whatever situation"
No," you 're in what is there to be glad about in this situation . So I 've trained my brain to do that over time and when you take the emotion out , something 's going to replace it and if you have skill in managing your mind , you 'll often look for what 's right rather than what 's wrong"
No," reframe things , get good at the Glad game , the Pollyanna game , whatever we 're going to call that right , we need to engage with reality . So how are things really instead of trying to run or hide from it , both the good and the bad ? So do n't over think you 're a loser failure , whatever"
No," um yeah . It 'S completely not helpful , because negative thinking disrupts brain function , but at the same time too positive of thinking you could be driving down the freeway at 125 miles an hour in the rain . I mean Positive Thinking by itself is harmful"
No," certified psychiatrist . So for people who do n't know what that means , so I 'm a general psychiatrist and I have a specialty in kids , I 'm a child in adolescent psychiatrist , I 'm a physician , I 'm highly educated and I do n't care at all about my own brain right . I love"
Environment," keep your brain healthy . You have to prevent or treat the 11 major risk factors that steal your mind . Yeah , so um brain enemy got care , avoid things that hurt it do things that help it , and so what ? What have we learned ? That exercise boosts blood flow to the brain"
No," , not believing every stupid thing . You think calms the anxiety centers in the brain things like omega3 fatty acids , get your gut right , because your gut makes most of the neurotransmitters in your body . Well , the little tiny habit for brain health is before you go to make"
No," answer the question in a positive way , because you love yourself , because you love yourself , your wife , your life , your mission , um , that 's why you do the right thing , because too often people go well . I ca n't have this and I ca n't have that and as"
No," First , what are some of the like just dead , simple , easy things that people should be thinking about with protecting the Brinks if they want to answer you know I want to do something , that 's good for my brain , but they do n't know what that is like well . So I went to my"
No," , really , okay , they put it in the good category when in fact it 's got way too much sugar and whenever you unwrap sugar from its fiber sores , it turns toxic in your body , and so so is this Good for my brain or bad for it , or is it good for my child 's brain or bad for it and they"
Environment," world 's first and largest study on football players on professional football players , and the level of damage is sad , but 80 percent of them get better when we put them on a rehabilitation program . So , even if you 've been bad to your brain"
No," , you can make it better and I can prove it . I'Ve spoken to my audience about it before , but the thing that led me to you is massive anxiety that seemed to be getting worse by the day and one of the things that helped me was crushing the ants , the automatic , negative thoughts and"
No," becoming a pattern interrupt And stopping that walk people through some of the things that are n't necessarily because we 'll get into diet , but that are n't diet related that are really just the way that they allow themselves to think whether it 's the brain , getting"
No," health , assessmentcom and I 'll go which of the 16 brain types . Do you have so let me take just a step back and that 'll answer that question . Whenever I see see someone . So if you came to see me , I 'm always thinking about the four circles of your life . So I 'm thinking about your"
Environment," biology so with anxiety . My first thought is areas in your emotional brain just are working too hard , and so it 's driving that anxiety . So what 's the biology ? What 'S the psychology , which is how do you think and the environment that you grew up in"
No," thinking bio , psychosocial , spiritual and that way , I end up helping whole people , not just oh you 're , anxious to exam , because that 's the quick answer that if you go to Kaiser for example - and I just hired a doctor from Kaiser and he saw 25 patients a day , so the 25 patient a day"
No," answer is Xanax is let me give you a benzo and the problem with it is once you start it , it 's Insidious . It changes your brain to need it in order to feel normal , and so I 'm like , so how else can we quell your anxiety so there 's some simple supplements like Gaba or one of"
Environment," the exercise whenever you feel sad or mad or nervous or out of control . I just want you to write down what you 're thinking and ask yourself if it 's true and I have um a process - I do n't know , if you want , we"
No," It certainly could be true yeah , but is it true , I ca n't say definitively , I do n't know sure right yeah , because I am not a fan of positive thinking . I am not interesting . Positive thinking kills way too many people , I 'm a fan of accidents too many people ."
No," What do you mean so they did a study at Stanford 1921 on 1548 10 year old children and they followed them for 90 years . Looking at what goes with success , Health and Longevity - and it was n't the do n't worry kids"
No," time the kids who got their homework done . The kids , who were responsible , who actually had a bit of anxiety because anxiety , prevents you from driving at 125 miles an hour down the freeway in the ray right . You need some anxiety , obviously too much it makes people"
No," want people listening for it to really be useful . I find that there 's a certain point where the anxiety kicks over into it feeling purely biological , and what I mean by that is . I ca n't differentiate between being cold and being anxious , they 're the same physical Sensations . So"
No," I 'm like am I just cold , or is this an exacerbation of the anxiety and so one of the quotes ? That is just seemed so true to me in my life , and this is n't how they meant it , but this is um you 'll understand in a second , why it 's always running so true . The only thing to fear"
No," is fear itself . So the only thing that I have to fear when it comes to public speaking is anxiety . It 'S like , if I did n't have to worry about the anxiety I 'M not worried about the performance or the outcome . I'Ve done it so many times , and so before I go on stage , I have to"
No," killing that initial thought , which is why that was so powerful for me . So killing the answers by it 's a biological treatment too , because when you believe these negative thoughts , it changes your physiology immediately um . So"
No," opposite , which is , I will be the best ever um , so the opposite of it . This will work out . You have any evidence that that 's true , if you 're thinking about you know whatever the situation and you"
No," and then when we switched it to I 'm , not dumb , and she had like 50 reasons why she was n't dumb right . But if you do n't challenge your thoughts , if you do n't question your thoughts , you believe them a hundred percent and then you act out of the belief"
No," so learning how to clean that up is really important , but sometimes they 're remnants of anxiety that are not driven by the Negative thoughts and their diaphragmatic breathing is so important . So if I was you well - and I used to be you because before I 'd speak"
No," that breathing pattern will do it also holding something warm . Will do it as well and first for some people they 'll just put their hands under warm water and if you could get in a sauna , that 's great or getting a hot tub . You ca n't do that before you speak , but"
No," so what is like , if somebody comes to you , I know you 're going to say that you scan the brain that gets a bit tough for everybody watching at home . But what are like ? The the basic protocols for some of the most typical things that you see is it are you , starting with diet ? Are you"
Environment," starting with exercise like how do you get people to take the the sort of edge off whatever they might be experiencing ? Well , I 'm usually working always in those four circles . So yes I 'll scan them , because if I do n't look , I do n't know , but not everybody can do it so and change"
No," Your Brain Change . Your Life . I think that 's my book . You read there 's one of the questionnaires that go : oh well , you 're more likely to have a limbic issue here or basal ganglion an anxiety issue with these symptoms or prefrontal cortex issue , which is so common for us"
Environment," with supplements first um , and so at home people could go to brainhealthassessmentcom find out which of the 16 types they have and then we 'll work on the biology along with Biology . Yes , you should exercise . Of course , you should and there 's certain kinds of"
Environment," exercise , especially coordination exercises , so Rocket Sports by far my favorite very few head injuries , but they work your cerebellum and the cerebellum , I think of it as the Rodney Dangerfield part of the brain . It gets no respect , even though it 's ten percent of the"
Environment," doing so a rocket sport if your wife likes ballroom dancing become good at it , because it 's a coordination exercise and then you want to stimulate it and there 's certain supplements that I actually like like"
No," thinning , because it helps you feel relaxed , but It really also helps you focus , and this is over the counter rhodiola ashwagandha ginseng . We actually make something we like called focus and energy , and we find it stimulates your frontal lobes and your cerebellum at the"
No," same time so and then stop hurting it . Alcohol is directly toxic to the cerebellum . I mean that 's why they make you try to walk a straight line . You ca n't because your cerebellum is not working , it 's being poisoned , so I hardly ever drink . What are"
No," off both sides of your cerebellum , so we just have to do so much better , protecting the brain so with that insane string of interactions with the brain how 's that , given you a new way to think about mental health , how should we reframe it ?"
No," , I 've come to realize these are not mental illnesses at all that their brain health issues . That steal your mind and when you really unpack this one idea , it just changes everything people begin to see their problems as medical and not moral . It decreases , shame and guilt , it"
No," increases compliance , it increases compassion and forgiveness because we begin to see bipolar disorder , schizophrenia or major depression like heart disease and no one is shamed for it , even though all of them have lifestyle contributions . What do you"
No," think that the stigma came from like why ? Because dude , it was not long ago where mental health issues was really really stigmatized . I would say it 's less now . I four years struggled with anxiety and did n't want to tell my wife , because I thought she would think less of me . Where"
No," act the way they do , but you do n't have any information on the actual biology and so for someone who struggles with anxiety what we learned . It 'S clearly not one thing : your brain could work too hard and that 's why you 're anxious ? Because you ca n't settle it down or it does n't"
No, work hard enough . So it ca n't suppress the anxious feelings or maybe there 's a toxin or trauma and most people with anxiety . They go to a therapist and they talk about what 's going on and so they 're working really on the
No," software of the issue . But what , if there 's a hardware concern I want to talk about the biology . I think this is really interesting and do would I think you would selfidentify as religious . Yes , you can have a church . You"
No," talk about church , a lot um . How do you think about sort of religion and that onetoone tie between the the physicality of the brain and the mind um ? There does n't seem to be a conflict for you where there is for a lot of"
No," you mean by that ? What is the impact , so we studied it in different states , so conversation States like different brainwave States or different like well . We studied the brain in different prayer States , okay , so , for example , I pray for you"
No," not real , but in places like Brazil , half the population believes in it and engages in those kinds of spiritual disciplines , and so the theory was when you speak in tongues or when you Channel , you have to drop the function in your brain . So you"
Environment," have to sort of drop the noise in your brain to become a vessel for the channel . So give me give me some of the brain waves , so full disclosure - I 'm not religious at all , and I definitely will count myself in sort of the deeply skeptical . But I accept that there are"
No," looks at blood flow and activity , and we also did quantitative EEG , which looks at the electrical activity in the brain . So if you think of Alpha States or Theta States , Theta States being more meditative State , although meditation fooled us , you sort"
No, the brain you 're looking so when we we say brain waves . What we 're looking at is how busy is your brain and we measure it in something called Waves per second or cycles per second and zero to two cycles per second is called delta waves and it 's what happens when we sleep
No," toxic , most effective treatment , so I would much rather do something like nerve feedback for you than just start . You willynilly on medication , but unfortunately that 's what 's happening in our society . 85 percent of psychiatric drugs are prescribed by nonpsychiatric"
No," there 's actually a table on which supplements have a level scientific evidence for things like insomnia , anxiety , depression , ADHD addiction , um and , and I 'm pretty excited About that all right , let 's go back to the"
No," neurofeedback and meditation prayer like how do we train ourselves to be in a different state ? So I do a lot of creative writing and there 's just a certain state that I think , is an alpha wave state . But reading your breakdown in the books , it may be more of a Theta"
No," state , so I 'll meditate for 15 to 20 minutes . I am focused entirely on diaphragmatic breathing , so I am trying to what I think of as lower the background radiation . So all of my stress all of my anxiety - I can get it to zero and unless there 's something really"
No," What are people doing ? How are they getting the neurofeedback ? Do you need that ? Can you get there through prayer meditation like how do we begin to shift gears ? Well , one of the reasons I really like neurofeedback is : when people meditate"
No," the only feedback , they 're getting is from themselves , and so , when you have instruments that can actually measure it , you have a better sense and then once we know it and we have our goal whatever That goal is more creativity , more Focus , less anxiety , irritability . Then we can"
Environment, specifically set those training protocols and give you feedback to know where you are um and that 's actually how I came to Imaging was through a treatment technique called biofeedback . So
No," biofeedback we measure things like hand , temperature heart rate , sweat , gland activity , muscle tension , breathing , brain waves , and so we know your Baseline and then we teach you so , for example , to warm your hands and if I teach you to warm your hands with your brain , it 's An"
No," automatic relaxation response , and so it triggers something called a parasympathetic response . So if you think of fight or flight is a sympathetic response , well , it 's the opposite of that and so well , how do you teach someone to warm their hands ? So first you put a"
No," cup of decaf coffee or it starts warming , people 's hands up yeah and it . When you warm your hand , it sends a signal to the rest of your body to calm down , because when you get stressed your hands get cold and they get sweaty . So when I was a young"
No," really good concept in my head . But as soon as you go think of your father , my hands get cold because we had a conflicted relationship . I mean he 's actually one of my best friends now , but it took a long time to get there , so your body"
No," activating , so that was like , like with meditation . You know it sort of fooled us . Yes , it calms your emotional brain , but it activates your cortical brain the most evolved . Human thoughtful part of the brain um hypnosis in the studies that have"
No," obviously fully awake and competent and so on . It 'S hypnotic state . So I 'm just directing people into a natural state because they 're more open , not more gullible , because you ca n't make people do things they would n't do , but I have found it helpful for sleep . It 'S helpful"
No," for pain , it 's helpful for anxiety and it just feels so good , which is , I think , because I had a lot of anxiety when I was young . I think I gravitated toward these things because I teach my patients because they also help me yeah . So the idea of hypnosis making you"
Environment," everybody can be hypnotized . But for some people like me , it 's training . You need to do it not one time and think of it as magic , but do it over time , and when you put yourself when you do the diaphragmatic breathing , which I 'm a huge fan of you 're actually beginning to put"
Environment," scattered attention to a spot close their eyes , and then the attention gets focused inward , okay , what 's happening in the brain . What are you trying to do in that first step ? What I 'm trying to do is decrease the noise and then"
No," , roll it down and then we 're going to do Progressive relaxation I 'll have them . Imagine the relaxation spreading from little tiny muscles in their eyes to their forehead to their scalp all the way down to the bottom of their feet and then I 'll do a deepening"
No," goals : a healthy blood , sugar level , plenty of sleep , no alcohol in your system , and you talk about marijuana as well , which would be nice and controversial . You do n't mention it in this quote , but you have in the book and you are not hungry , angry lonely or tired , and I thought that"
No," likely to get it so , for example , you 've met Tana uh . I want a kind , caring , loving , supportive , passionate relationship with my wife . I always want that , but I do n't always feel like that ."
No," Puffs does n't fit the goals . I have right because one of my goals is to be physically healthy . If you 're trying to change medical specialty , you want to live a long time , because it 's going to take a long time , and so I want to be healthy , because that gives me energy and"
No, that you only want to love food that loves you back that you 're in a relationship with food . I think 30 percent of the mental health problems in America are related to our terrible diet that you are what you eat in large part and if you 're eating
No," their brain went down . I believe it healthy weight , overweight , obese , morbidly , obese in a linear fashion . When I saw those graphs when I was doing the research , I was just like horrified and I come from a family of fat people . My dad used to hate when"
No," the extra fat on your body produces inflammatory cytokines and we know inflammation , is a major cause of depression and dementia . The fat on your body takes healthy testosterone , which we need which men and women need , and it turns it into unhealthy cancerpromoting"
Environment," forms of estrogen . That 'S a bad thing that stores toxins . We need to get serious about being in a healthy way with healthy food , and so diet is critical . Exercise . Supplementation , I think , is really important . I did a study , 97 percent of"
No," 19 . So yeah going back to what you 're saying about fat shaming . So , first of all , I come from a morbidly obese family as well , and I 've often said that you , when you love something you do n't hate on it , look down on it , like , I do n't think less of people , because they 're obese , but"
Environment," Survive this disease - that 's ravaging you know the entire human population . If you are living a healthy lifestyle , get your weight under control . Exercise , Eat Right , work out all of that stuff , because there 's nothing worse than trying to solve a problem . When you ignore the"
No," that for a second , because I learned a long time ago as a psychiatrist , if you do n't admit you have a problem , you ca n't solve it dude that is so true until I finally admitted to my wife that I was anxious , I I could n't make progress and finally , I just was like [ __ ] . I have to"
No," everybody in my family 's fat , it 's like no . I have a lot of fat people in my family and I 'm not because I do n't give into the behaviors making it likely to be so , and so it 's about being intentional reading the labels of the food you eat , of the products you put on"
No," intuitively people should know that right . If I do n't sleep tonight - and I 'm not going to think well tomorrow , but no one 's thinking about the physical functioning of their brain , so I 'm in Justin , Bieber 's new docuseries seasons and he came out . I'Ve been his doctor for"
No," health right , get your brain right and your mood is better you 're , happier you 're more focused , you make less bad decisions which will decrease your anxiety speaking of anxiety . So you said earlier that you think 30 percent of mental"
No," health brain health problems are tied to diet . In my n of one experience , I think it 's even higher than that . So when I think about okay suffering from profound anxiety , I 'm trying all the mental tricks and there 's no doubt they helped . I mean"
No," very , very beneficial , but I just could n't I felt like I was learning to better cope with these symptoms . But I was n't eliminating the symptoms , and so I was like what is going on and then , of course , because of what my wife went through from a health perspective , become aware"
No," of the gut start , really thinking about what I 'm eating and that there are going to be Things that might be messing me up That I just would never have guessed long time . Listeners in my show will grow tired of hearing the following statement , but at the beginning of covid I went"
No," and I 'm like , but my diet 's so healthy like how could this possibly be , and I was like just eliminate whatever you 're eating a lot of and see what happens and I 'm like what am I eating a lot of , and I was Like pecans , and so I cut out pecans 48 hours later , I was back in business . I"
No," thinking wait . A second could my anxiety be tied to something I 'm eating , and so then I started cutting out anything processed because dude , I love my zero calorie drinks , love them in a way . I ca n't even begin to tell you , but of course that comes with a lot of"
No," chemicals that I 've never even heard of , and I 've heard of a lot of chemicals and in cutting all of that out the what my anxiety feels like to me now . I might still have a thought about something 's going to go wrong in the future and that will trigger that that feeling of like"
No," oh something bad is coming , but it never escalates . Food is so important and um . When I put my patients on an Elimination Diet . So we basically eliminate the bad things"
No," , I 'm very worried because , as the perception of dangerousness of a drug goes down , its use goes up , especially in teenagers and if you 're smoking or eating Edibles as a teenager , you 've just increased your risk of anxiety , depression and suicide . In your 20s , so"
No," that 's it 's not good , and I you know all child psychiatrists , I 'm also a child psychiatrists have the experience of all of a sudden the 16 year old is not acting right and we test them and they end up positive for marijuana that it 's Not innocuous - and I think that 's the"
No," important thing now is it worse than alcohol . Well , actually , I published a study on 62 000 . This is the world 's largest Imaging study , 62 000 scans on how the brain ages , and then we looked at what accelerated aging schizophrenia was the worst your brain looked 10 years"
No," older than people who did n't have schizophrenia . The second worst - and it was a surprise for me - was marijuana your brain worse than alcohol or , worse than alcohol , worse than smoking . What I am startled by that yeah I was too , and it 's like it 's the data and wow . I have no dog"
No," in the fight right if you smoke , if you do n't smoke , you 're , just actually more likely to see me if you do , is it lowering blood flow like it 's watering blood flow to the brain wow , I thought for sure you were going to say Alcohol was the worst yeah , but"
No," neither of them are good man , that 's crazy , yeah , so food can make you happy so can drugs . That 'S the that 's the problem like when I think about all the the insults that people can do to their brain . How important the brain is for the mind and"
No," So , but the number of things that insult our brain from just concussive trauma from certain types of contact Sports to um , sitting around to weed alcohol , a lot of things that are fun and over prescription of drugs . Oh , my"
No," traces of micronutrients, and glucose. The brain is, of course, more than just the sum of its nutritional parts, but each component does have a distinct impact on functioning, development, mood, and energy."
No," So that postlunch apathy, or latenight alertness you might be feeling, well, that could simply be the effects of food on your brain. Of the fats in your brain, the superstars are omegas 3 and 6. These essential fatty acids, which have been linked to preventing degenerative brain conditions, must come from our diets."
No," sleep, attentiveness, and weight. They're one of the reasons we might feel calm after eating a large plate of pasta, or more alert after a proteinrich meal. The complex combinations of compounds in food can stimulate brain cells to release moodaltering norepinephrine,"
No," dopamine, and serotonin. But getting to your brain cells is tricky, and amino acids have to compete for limited access. A diet with a range of foods helps maintain a balanced combination of brain messengers, and keeps your mood from getting skewed in one direction or the other."
No," are also fundamental to brain health and early cognitive development. In order for the brain to efficiently transform and synthesize these valuable nutrients, it needs fuel, and lots of it. While the human brain only makes up about 2% of our body weight, it uses up to 20% of our energy resources. Most of this energy comes from carbohydrates"
No," opting for a varied diet of nutrientrich foods is critical. When it comes to what you bite, chew, and swallow, your choices have a direct and longlasting effect on the most powerful organ in your body."
No," other presenting complaints . If there are multiple presenting complaints , you should work with the patient to establish a shared agenda for the rest of the consultation . In the context of taking a respiratory history , you may find that patients"
No," present with multiple respiratory symptoms , for example , they may have breathlessness and a cough . So , let 's now look at some of the key respiratory symptoms you may come across top of the list is dyspnea or breathlessness ."
No," Other common symptoms include cough which may be associated with hemoptysis or coughing up blood , wheeze , chest pain or systemic symptoms , such as a fever . We'Re going to discuss these symptoms in"
No," pain , but it can be applied to most other symptoms . However , it 's worth bearing in mind that some of the elements of socrates may not be relevant to all symptoms . The first part of the socrates framework involves establishing the sight of the"
No," symptom , for example , in a patient , presenting with pain . We would want to ask about the location of the pain . We then move on and ask questions about the symptoms , onset , for example , in a patient presenting with breathlessness . We might want to clarify"
No," whether the breathlessness came on suddenly or more gradually . It 'S then important to ask some specific questions to establish the characteristics of the symptom . For example , we could ask patients with breathlessness to describe how it feels ."
No," Is it constant or does it come and go radiation involves asking if the symptom moves anywhere else ? This is most commonly applied to patients , presenting with pain , for example . If they have chest pain . Does this spread to any other part of the"
No," body ? We then move on and explore whether there are any other symptoms which are associated with the primary symptom ? The patient may not have mentioned these earlier in open questioning , so it may be important to ask them about some specific symptoms"
No," , for example , if they are presenting with breathlessness , we might want to ask them directly whether they are experiencing any chest . Pain time course refers to how the symptom has changed over time . So it 's important to build up a picture of how the symptom has changed since its"
No," onset , for example , you might want to ask : how is the shortness of breath changed over time ? Exacerbating or relieving factors involves asking the patient if anything makes the symptom worse or better ."
No," This is quite important in the context of a respiratory history , because patients may present with respiratory symptoms which are worsened by certain situations . For example , a patient with asthma may have symptoms which are worsened by"
Environment," their occupation or being in a work environment . Finally , severity involves asking the patient to assess the severity of the symptom by getting them to grade it on a scale of zero to ten . This is most commonly used when asking patients about"
No," their pain , but it can be applied to other symptoms too . Let 'S look at our first key respiratory symptom dyspnea . This means shortness of breath or breathlessness , and this is a very common symptom of respiratory disease . It 'S important to explore the onset time"
No, course and any exacerbating and relieving factors . One of the ways we can assess the severity of dyspnea is by using the medical research council dyspnea scale . This scale assesses the functional limitation of the patient due to their
Environment," dyspnea . There are five grades , and this ranges from being breathless during strenuous exercise only which is grade one and mild to grade five , where the patient is too breathless to leave the house or breathless even when dressing ."
No," Our next key respiratory symptom is cough . Cough can be categorized into acute , subacute and chronic , and this relates back to asking the patient about the onset and the time course of their symptom ."
No," So an acute cough is one which is present for less than three weeks . A subacute cough is one which has been present for between three and eight weeks , and a chronic cough is one which is persistent for more than eight weeks . It 'S important in your respiratory"
No," history to ask the patient directly about hemoptysis hemoptysis means coughing up blood , and this is a red flag , symptom for more serious pathology , such as lung cancer . Our next key symptom is wheeze . A wheeze is a coarse , continuous"
No," , whistling sound produced in the respiratory airways during breathing , it 's associated with airway narrowing and obstruction , so diseases such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and anaphylaxis , which cause airway , narrowing"
No," and obstruction , can cause wheeze wheeze may be audible without a stethoscope And may be reported by the patient or their carer . Chest pain is another key symptom to cover in a respiratory history . We can use the socrates framework discussed earlier in order to explore the chest"
No," pain in more detail . Patients with respiratory disease such as a pulmonary embolism or inflammation of the pleural lining , such as pleurisy following a chest , infection may present with pleuritic chest pain ."
No," This is often described as being really sharp and worsened by breathing and coughing . It 'S also worth remembering that cardiovascular conditions , for example a patient having an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial"
No," infarction , can present with respiratory symptoms , for example , they may present with chest pain and breathlessness . Our last set of symptoms are systemic symptoms . These include things such as fatigue"
No," , fever , night , sweats and weight loss . The presence of these symptoms is suggestive of a more serious underlying disease process , for example an underlying cancer causing fatigue and weight loss ."
No," , concerns and expectations often referred to as ice . This helps us gain an insight into how the patient currently perceives the situation , what they are worried about and what they hope to gain from the consultation ."
No," condition , it 's useful to gather more details to assess how wellcontrolled the disease is . This is especially important when it comes to longterm conditions such as asthma and copd . It can also be useful to identify which"
No, treatments the patient is receiving and whether they 've had any hospital admissions as a result of their condition . You should also ask if the patient has previously undergone any surgery or procedures . Some patients may have limited knowledge
No," may identify in your respiratory history . Many of these conditions are longterm conditions , and patients may be undergoing active treatment and present with symptoms related to these conditions . For example , a patient with chronic"
No," obstructive pulmonary disease may present , with an exacerbation of their disease or a patient with asthma may present , with a worsening of asthma , symptoms or an asthma attack . There are increasing levels of"
No," multimorbidity , which is the presence of several longterm conditions . So you may find in your respiratory history . The patient has several of these conditions . For example , they may have copd , which has"
No," then led to the development of heart failure and they then go on and suffer a pulmonary embolism . When considering drug history , you should ask if the patient is taking any prescribed or overthecounter medicines . If the patient is taking a medicine , you"
No," should find out about the dose frequency form and root . It 'S also worth asking about whether the patient is experiencing any side effects from their medication . Some medications can cause respiratory side effects . For example , a dry cough is a very common"
No," side . Effect of a class of drugs called ace inhibitors which are used in the management of high blood pressure . You should also ask if the patient has any allergies and , if so , clarify what type of reaction they had to the substance ."
No," It 'S important here to distinguish the patient , who had a mild rash versus a patient who had a fullblown anaphylaxis reaction following administration of a medication . These are the broad categories of medication . You may come across in a drug history which are"
No," relevant to respiratory disease . Probably the biggest category are the inhalers . Inhalers are used in the management of a wide range of respiratory disease , but most commonly asthma and copd inhalers fall into different categories"
No," of oral steroids . Patients who are having exacerbations of disease may be placed on a course of oral steroids . Various other drugs you may come across include the mucolytics such as carbocyne , and these are used in patients with"
No, excessive secretions leukotriene receptor antagonists are used in the management of chronic asthma . Theophylline is a less commonly used drug in the treatment of asthma . One important fact about theophylline is that it should be prescribed by brand
No," name . Finally , patients with respiratory disease may be taking antibiotics . These may be prescribed in the acute setting , for example , the management of an effective exacerbation of copd or some patients with chronic"
No, respiratory disease may take longterm antibiotics to prevent infection in your family history . You should ask the patient whether they 've had any firstdegree relatives with respiratory disease . You want to find out about the age at
No," which the disease developed and the cause of death , if applicable , there are some respiratory conditions , such as cystic fibrosis , which are inherited diseases . For example , cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and a family history is"
No," patient 's general social context , including , for example , the type of accommodation they live in who lives with the patient . What 'S their personal support network , you should find out a bit about their activities of daily living and what"
No," tasks they 're able to carry out independently and what tasks they require . Assistance with , it 's also important to establish whether they have any care or input . Smoking is a significant risk factor for many respiratory diseases , including chronic"
No," obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer . You should record the patient 's smoking history , including the type and amount of tobacco used . This can be quantified in terms of pack years . One pack is 20 cigarettes and to"
Environment," respiratory history . For example , it 's important to establish the patient 's current and previous occupations . This helps identify any potential exposure to agents which may lead to respiratory disease . For example , certain occupations such as people"
No," alveolitis . It 'S also important to ask about pets and hobbies . Allergies to pets . Are common and may not be immediately obvious in the history , for example , a patient with asthma may find that they 're wheezy when they 're at"
Environment," home , but not when they 're outside of the house and the trigger here may be the family pet . Other aspects of the social history involve asking about alcohol , recreational drug use , gambling and exercise ."
No," Are you struggling with breathing ? Have you had any diagnosis of a chronic respiratory disease like COPD , asthma or interstitial lung disease ? Oh , are you feeling that embarrassment , guilt or shame while you 're coughing up that phlegm or bringing around your"
No," oxygen cans in the park or in public places , or are you limiting yourself due to the embarrassment and falling in the Trap of depression or anxiety or panic attacks"
No," Or are you having a friend or a relative having all those symptoms , or are you a healthcare professional having expertise in polymer , rehab or otherwise known as respiratory rehab , then this video is for you to look into what we do for support and"
Environment," care for the mental Health issues in people with chronic respiratory disease foreign folks welcome to Long wine Channel . If you 're watching me for the first time I 'm Miss Devi , Sundar specialized in Palmer Rehabilitation , Counseling"
No," , Psychotherapy and health coaching . I have over 20 years of therapy experience in dealing with people with chronic respiratory disease majorly COPD , asthma and Industrial lung disease , and today I 'm going to talk about . Did we understand mental health in chronic"
No," respiratory disease right ? So , under this topic , I 'm going to touch on what is mental health mental injuries ? How do we know if your family , member or friend , or a patient , struggling emotionally ? What is the management plan to heal mental injuries in people with"
No," mental health is defined . As absence of mental illness , a person is confirmed to have a poor or a good mental health by their behaviors , but we all forget to label the mental injuries . This not only include PTSD , posttraumatic , stress disorder . It also includes the anxiety"
No," and depression . There is evidence that people with COPD have higher levels of mental injuries , anxiety and depression compared to other chronic health conditions . In 2010 , a longitudinal study by sineader etold , looking at 35 000 patients with"
No," COPD over a 10year period , confirmed 162 cases of depression per thousand person years in COPD compared to 94 cases . Only in noncoupd group . Why this difference the impact of mental injury is caused by the lung function , empowerment . This is severity and health"
No," casualization in patients with COPD or for a case , any patients with chronic respiratory disease . We all know mental injury reduces a person 's quality of life and days of predicted living . How can we know and help those people suffering with mental injuries"
No," , especially in people with chronic respiratory disease ? How do you know if your family , member or friend , or your patient , struggling emotionally first thing ? You will notice a change in their behavior ? What am I talking"
No," , you 'll see a change in the behavior of their selfcare examples , stopping medications or medication . Regimen inconsistency , lack of sleep weight gain or loss complains of tiredness headache , which is often missed in the assessment lack of interest in their selfimage"
No," feeling very worthless , hopeless social withdrawal , negative thinking about the future impact concentration , hypersensitive bodily Sensations . What is the management plan to heal mental injuries in people with chronic respiratory disease ? If a person is"
No," identified with anxiety , depression , what they do they reach out to GP and take a consultation for 10 to 15 minutes and end up with a prescription for an SSRI , metazizobine or antipsychotics . But all those medications do is to improve temporarily the neurotransmitter"
No," formed between the brain cells and brings as a very active in forming and more plastic and with aging . This flexibility of the plasticity is reduced and it uh . The older neural Park , which has been formed previously , remains very fixed"
Environment, introduction to neuroplasters today now . Let me talk about how this is making sense when we are dealing with mental injuries in people with chronic respiratory disease . It is widely acknowledged . Polymer Rehabilitation is a gold standard
No," management for people with COPD and other chronic respiratory disease . Pulmonary habitation is called to have a biopsychosocial model of care . The irony is in my experience . Over 20 years , I 've seen about 90 percent of population are having a firm diagnosis of COPD in"
Environment, their 50s or 60s and referred to a polymer rehabilitation program in their 70s or 80s and looking into the polymer Rehabilitation assessment and delivery of care . Most polymer rehabilitation program assess only their demographic age and gender parks and prison medical
Environment," history of the patient security , gradient of the physical illness , disability , but majority of the polymer Rehabilitation settings all the reference sources do n't assess the biological context . That 'S the genetic vulnerability , neurochemistry stress reactivity , the psychological"
No," contacts like the learning , behaviors attitudes , beliefs , personalities , emotions of the patient , their perception of their illness and cognitive distortions , coping skills , past traumas and the social contacts like their social support , family background , cultural traditions"
Environment," and social economic status And education and I need to actually acknowledge here , uh most common rehabited selling , including myself , use some form of emotional impact questioners on the people 's quality of life commonly used are the hospital anxiety and depression"
No," questionnaire , um generalized or a questioner and Got7 , and the patient has Questionnaire 9 , phq9 and geriatric depression scale , but after assessing their psychological impact under these quality of life , do we have the resources to support the"
Environment," : great care begins with an open question , always apply a compassionate communication to your loved one suffering with the chronic response disease or to your patient , to create a psychological safety . How do you do this respect their privacy ? Listen to what"
Environment," The second tip is to include therapy sessions like cognitive , behavioral therapy acceptance and commitment therapy trauma focused or integrated therapy Fashions , along with the physical activity and education resources to in the final Rehabilitation setting"
No," , and the third tip is include activities that promote neuroplastic survey . I hope this video was informative . If you feel the same , please do click that , like button and share with your friends the network I 'll see you in the next video Until"
No," talking about chronic cough and the diagnostic approach and kind of management principles when it comes to chronic cough in patients . So definitions , acute cough is typically less than three weeks . Subacute is typically three to eight weeks and I actually have an"
No," episode about Subacute cough . It was a video episode and it was recorded before the pandemic , so it does not include covid considerations in that episode . But if you want to think about the other considerations , aside from covid , definitely check that episode out . I will"
No," link to that below and talks about specifically approach to when to use antibiotics , and then this episode is about chronic cough . So that 's a cough of more than eight weeks . I feel , like I 've , seen different definitions of whether eight weeks or three months , things like"
No," that , but it 's approximate right approximately that so first I want to talk about history , approach to history , differentials and red flags and then some work up steps and kind of like next Treatment steps after that , so real , quick before we get into history"
No," , three really common causes of chronic cough number . One is actually not a respiratory cause . It is a GI cause um , which is GERD and um . So so so many people have um have Gerd and some people have the typical symptoms of heartburn , with spicy foods and worse after meals ."
No," Things like that . Some people have silent reflux , where they do n't have any signs of typical heartburn , but they do have a flummy cough . After meals and it can be worse before bedtime , and then they can wake up with like a sore throat or halitosis from having all that extra"
No," acid in their throats overnight um , so just a little Pearl there gerd can be a common cause . Asthma can also be a common cause , which we know a lot about : asthma right and then another common cause is allergies , and you and I and I start off the episode saying that is"
No," because most of the time once you 've ruled out red flags . Those are the first things that you 're going to think about working up and potential doing a treatment trial to see if they improve so yeah . So allergies are things like post nasal drip right , so patients can"
No," have a runny nose or itchy watery eyes . It 'S seasonal , like the typical stuff , but some people just have this little like throat clearing cough like , and I actually do that for patients in the visit , which maybe they think I 'm crazy . But I 'm like you , have a cough like this ."
No," Old cart , acronym right , so we want to ask about medication , use so medications . That is one other kind of like quick and easy thing to assess , especially with ACE inhibitors , because so many people take ACE inhibitors and that , like bradykine and related cough"
No," like that , absolutely can be a cause of a chronic cough , especially if it 's a dry cough . So we want to ask about medications : medication reconciliation is always important , but especially important in chronic cough . The next pieces are history , questions related to"
No," getting more into like your red flag of concern right , so we want to ask about again : characteristics of the cough is included in old car , but let 's just talk about some specifics right . Is it a dry cough ? Is it a flummy mucousy cough ? Is it there all the time ? Does it come and go ?"
No," um . We want to ask about the characteristics . If somebody has a expectorant right , if they have anything that comes up when they cough , is it mucus , is there any blood ? Is there a color ? Is it frothy ? Is it um lots of you know any other"
No," , so red flag symptoms you want to elicit , are : are there any systemic symptoms like do they have fever ? Do they have night sweats and do they have weight loss ? Absolutely must ask those questions with a chronic cough right , because when you think about it"
No," , fevers night sweats unintentional weight loss again when it comes to weight loss . We always want to ask specific questions of . Is this intentional or unintentional ? How much over what period of time asking those questions do they have any altered mental status , especially your elderly"
No," patients or patients who are over the age of 65 ? Do they have hemoptysis right ? We'Ve already talked about that eliciting that question , but that is a red flag . Is this worsening a chronic shortness of breath ? I did n't say this in the history , but we"
No," do want to ask about shortness of breath , and this is a chronic shortness of breath . That 'S potentially worsening um , especially with activity . Do they have Associated chest pain , um ? We also want to ask about smoking history . I do n't think I said that yet"
No," because I skipped over it when I was talking about gerd , but we always want to ask about smoking history . But if somebody has a smoking history with a chronic cough , you want to keep that in your mind as like . You know what , let 's be a little bit more cautious with this"
No," cyanosis when it comes to smoking history . I wanted to add that too , when I was a new grad . I'Ve said this in a couple of episodes . I was just kind of so eager to check off my questions that it and I think it 's just totally normal just to normalize that that it 's like . Oh"
No," outtakes because there can be funny but um . I ca n't remember , if I said already about assessing , if they what happened at the beginning of their cough like if this was three months ago , did it start because they had covid right or they had some sort of infectious illness that"
No," went away , and now they still Have the cough right ? That 'S just ! I just want to put that in there , because I do n't think I mentioned that one yet , but the next steps again cardiac respiratory lower extremity heent . We want to think about some Labs"
No," to go like what are we Thinking about in terms of further differentials , aside from those most common ones , right are we thinking about COPD ? Are we thinking about heart failure ? Are we thinking about some sort of infectious cause , some chronic bronchitis bronchiectasis , like"
No," those types of things ? Is this long covid related to their coronavirus , illness before um and yeah , and and basically your next steps , like you want to think about that testing of those labs ? Do they need a quantiferon ? Do they need a chest xray"
No," versus ? Are you like I 'm , really confident based on their history in their exam ? If this is a gerd or allergies , do I do a treatment trial of those two things ? We talk all about how to manage allergies , nasal rinses , um , pluticasone , try not to the brand name"
No," there . Um , do they need oral um allergy medications ? Do they shower at night before bed right all of those lifestyle interventions , plus gerd treatment , lifestyle interventions , medications potentially versus am I"
No," really concerned about their smoking history the way they 're presenting those types of things ? If I 'm not super confident that it 's those first two girder allergies , then we 're moving on to a chest xray , because we really want to make sure that there 's no other"
No," then that is really a branching point for you of decision making of is this appropriate for Primary Care ? Is this Garden variety ? I do n't know asthma , maybe right , you can probably handle that in Primary Care , at least the initial treatment based on"
No," understanding with the patient of like listen , I 'm going to order this test and also we need to go talk with a pulmonologist to understand how this these test results Affect you and the further treatment , etc , etc versus you , in your clinic , in your philosophy of"
No," , but hopefully that 's a clear picture of like you know what treatment trial , if it 's very clear work up , if it 's less clear , you have to use your clinical judgment for that piece , but yeah when it comes to a treatment trial . One last note about that is like I still am cautious"
No," coughs and primary care if you have not grabbed the ultimate resource guide for the new NP head over to realworldnpcom guide . You'Ll get these episodes sent straight to your inbox every week , with notes from me , patients stories and bonuses . I really just do n't share"
No," Culture and society defined . On the one hand , culture consists of the beliefs , behaviors objects and other characteristics common to the members of a particular group or society . It is important to note that through culture , people and groups define"
No," themselves and draw meaning from it conform to society 's shared values and contribute to society , especially in terms of development . Thus , culture includes many societal aspects , such as language , customs , values , norms , mores rules , tools , technologies"
Environment," , products , organizations and institutions . On a side note , the term institution refers to clusters of rules and cultural meanings associated with specific social activities . Common institutions are the family , education , religion , work and health care ."
Environment," by the upper class , refers to classical music theater , fine arts and other sophisticated pursuits . Members of the upper class can pursue high art because they have cultural capital , which means the professional credentials , education , knowledge and"
No," such a way as to share a common culture . The cultural bond may be ethnic or racial based on gender or due to shared beliefs , values and activities . The term society can also have a geographic meaning and refer to people who share a common culture in a"
Environment," particular location . For example , people living in cold temperate climates , developed , different cultures from those living in tropical climates . As we can see , culture and society are intricately related"
No," factor that holds us back from thinking in terms of abundance and thinking in terms of positivity ? Why do we stay stuck on negative thinking , negative thoughts and limited mindsets ? So much yeah , that 's a big question . So the simple answer is that the"
No," ancient egypt , they thought it was just like flan or something and the soul was in the heart , and i believe you know i can see that . I hope i 've opened chess before for cardiac surgery and it 's fierce and what they would do is stick a straw up the nose and slurp out the"
Environment," this , so the first thing i had to realize was : no . This thing is working in a as an environment as an ocean filled with like a kelp forest and jellyfish . So if you drop something into the ocean , you 're not going to disrupt , there 's no spot for something"
No," mean the harmony is disrupted . So , for example , one frontal lobe we can surgically remove if needed after trauma or tumor and patients function . They drive , they talk on the phone again , you do n't want this"
No," one occipital lobe does n't leave you blind . It 'S that people think occipital blindness . No , if i take out a tumor from the right , occipital lobe , i just ca n't trust my left rear view mirror . When i drive it 's a it 's , a field cut ."
No," is under attack , tumor trauma a nail whatever . It is something happens that part of the brain . It may not hold you back from your creativity or your critical thinking , potentially no it because the rest of your brain can compensate"
No," The first time i saw somebody do brain surgery i was like . Is that possible first like ? Can you even remove the skull and they 're like yeah and then they were , you know . Can you remove that tissue to get to the tumor they 're like yeah ? You just have to"
No," nail injury , you do get a certain deficit , but in your thinking your feeling , your emotions , your love , your fear , it 's not a fear spot or a love spot . It 'S it 's sort of again . The aurora borealis and the worlds of of of a school of birds just flowing in"
No," different energy right so that fish a square fish or something yeah yeah . Exactly that 's fascinating ! That 'S that 's ! I want people to walk away with okay . So what that leaves people with is the fear i have is real , but it 's not fixed . It 'S not wired , it 's"
No," parents ask for it and it helps the child , we can actually make a big incision and take away a frontal lobe of parietal lobe and occipital lobe , that 's sparking seizures and when they wake Up that left side"
No," three years later and that half of brain was still gone still Gone yeah , it did n't sprout back , it 's not like a liver where we cut half of it off and the mom grows . Some back . You take a chunk of me . You put in the kid so that part is still missing yet that function has returned . That 'S"
No," you can talk , people are talking and moving , that 's how people conceive or conceptualize the brain um , but what happens when they they roar together . That 'S what i mean by the electricity there 's , an energy right , there 's an"
No," energy , you feel it it 's an epiphenomena ! Okay ! Now you now , let 's build an engine . The parts are there , you fired up and there 's a hum right , that 's more than just the engine and the pistons"
No," current understanding of how the brain leads to the mind . Wow yeah can the brain function without the mind if you get knocked down the ring , you 're , not thinking right and if we put electrodes"
No," keeping you breathing high level cognitive function . That way , so the mind is really what 's keeping everything activated . That 'S what yeah that 's in concert right right . The mind can think down the heart rate that the"
No," , the roar , the electrical global waves that are pulsating through our brains and when people say they 're in the zone or they 're in a flow state or they 're in a meditative state that that global energy flow"
No," drill in football or you 're a ballerina , and you have that that perfect , you know dance routine , coming up or maneuver um . You are actually disengaging some of the things that would get in the way of you releasing a performance so you 're , not thinking the performance you 're"
No," Practice and it takes is a lot of learning and then , when you 're performing and being confident in your abilities and yeah yeah , but it 's executing you know , i do n't think you can get . No , i 'm not be wrong , but when i see my kids , i do n't think you"
No," they knew . This was bad for us and they kept trying to hide it from us . Of course , hey just tell us , it 's bad just tell us smoking 's bad . We know boxing 's bad . Nobody goes into boxing and says i do n't know yeah , but you you held information"
Environment," That 'S you know what i mean it 's more about that to me . Not we all live in different worlds and safety and yeah risk and what 's what 's um , my plans did n't play though they could have , but they did n't , they did n't yeah , they played flag and"
No," mean by that is resetting a bone after it 's broken the pain of a cancer surgery . But then you know that your cancer has been cut out , like that . That 'S good pain right and we 're just talking about physical"
No," trauma . Yes , then , there 's emotional trauma if when if people are attacked , that 's also intimately connected to emotional trauma right , so the the people who do n't have memory after"
No," certain uh injuries or operations , they never have ptsd because they do n't remember it . So . The emotional context and memories related to trauma , be it emotional , physical or a combination requires memory . That 'S cool"
No," right . That said , okay , so that said , yeah you get a bruise . What i 'm hearing you say is , but what i hear you say is that if we do n't have the memory of the traumatic event we do n't have ptsd , we do n't have trump . We do n't have a trauma detail"
No," right so that that 's the that 's the concept that people that i want people to walk away , say memory is important . Memory is the thing that determines whether the event remains traumatic or whether it 's painful still for you ."
No," So , let 's get into that , so we just need to heal the memory of the trauma , that 's exactly where i 'm taking it um very good . The so memories are not uh files in a cabinet"
No," and actually in the brain yeah . How is memory categorized again ? It 'S there are some regions that we , if we remove them , you would lose memory , but memory is not only there . It relies on pulling from"
No," memories of smell to new , like , for example , smell is very interesting . It 'S one of the five senses that we ca n't tamp down with our thinking , so the perfume or cologne smell and memory are intimately intertwined and so you 're pulling from all different parts of the"
No," brain . Again , memory is a certain electrical flow in the brain um , but it 's not it 's malleable . It 'S moldable , just because you have a certain memory today"
No," , does n't mean that that experience , good or bad will remain good or bad . Our pop our positive vibe right now can be made negative . Our negative vibe right now can be made positive as we look back at our day today . So when you see memory that"
No," i 'm traumatized again , i clench up , i have like stress or fear , anxiety , yeah , so the emotional , the emotional context to a memory is what you can change . You do n't want to . You do n't want dementia , you do n't want to delete the memory because that 's a"
No," different problem : yeah , you do n't want to block it . You do n't want yeah , but you . What you want to do is change the emotional context attached to that memory . What happens if we you hear this from people a lot who might have been traumatized as kids"
No," , where they forget they kind of blocked the memory , and then they , whenever they research , it 's very raw but they 've , stuffed it they 've , blocked it they 've numbed it"
No," real comfortable with what i 've been reading and learning so emotional context to memory for adults in the right . Setting with the right person , through ex you know , they have their techniques"
No," , you can actually work through the trauma of the memory and the experience by going to certain therapists who help you get better with that so process . The memory yeah just to take take the emotional"
No," pain right , the emotional trauma and dampen that so you can say , for example , yeah i was you know , i 'm just bringing examples from my world yeah when i was"
No," physical experience of cancer pain and cancer surgery ? Right , that 's the lesson i want everybody to go through um in their mind when they 're dealing with their own challenges , wow . What 'S the biggest lessons you 've learned from"
No, the cancer patients you 've treated on the way they process and handle their journey from first hearing about they have cancer in the brain or tumor or something to recovery . What 'S the biggest lessons
No," the way i am now after a cancer diet . Oh man like i wish i would live my life having seen the finish line relatively because it changes how they live and they 're , not sad . It 'S a generalization like i said , some have suffered"
No," , but for breast cancer or lung cancer that spreads to the brain . It 'S sort of the uh , the the final manifestation of the cancers right man now , but those are heroic stories to me right that , oh man , that look you gave me that was me"
No," These are kids with it . No moms , who have breast cancer 15 year olds in ninth grade in there , but so when you see them it 's uh , like i said it 's , i do n't it 's not sad at all for me anymore right , it 's actually"
Environment," they 're , whatever genetics , is it 's their environment , their levels of stress their food intake ? Is it . You know anxiety , they 're , dealt with trauma that they 're not processing . What is the"
No," the cause of most cancer ? There are cancers we potentially give ourselves from our bad choices . Really give me smoking . Okay , yeah , okay um , but not everybody - has smoke , gets it right and 20 of lung cancer . People never"
No," smoke . So really right , then , where do they get lung cancer from if they 're , not smoking ? So uh ? Do you remember ? I was talking about the brain being this garden and stuff like that . Well , our bodies they 're , not an interesting"
No," positive thinking . There 'S no , i 'm not saying it 's not possible and i encourage people to do it , but i think positive thinking , um meditating"
No, brain . But i do n't know if a thought can send an electrical zap to a tumor and hurt the tumor . But a certain way of thinking can make you have a certain physiologic response
No," it as a garden , oh think , of it as a garden or a school of fish . You know working on harmony , yeah , all these different things right . So , if our , if we have a level of thinking that is , let 's call it positive , let 's call it"
No," beautiful thinking as opposed to suffering , based thinking , beautiful thoughts , joy , gratitude , happiness , peace , appreciation , acknowledgement , self love and love for others . Let 'S say those types of thoughts versus the the opposite of suffering"
Environment," too stressed that 's the common ailment of city life , at least here , where We have safety . This is really fascinating . It 'S one of my favorite things that i that i love talking about uh . You remember . We talked about the"
No," , hey . Maybe no we 're going to cross that freeway or right right , maybe wear that seat belt , so it it it 's learning it 's , but it 's interacting with emotions . At the same time , you do n't want to be emotionless . So emotion is making a push back . To"
No," thought like no love is an emotion . This pain , i 'm feeling because mom is sick , is an emotion . I do n't want to be spock about it or tap it down , so that cultivation of thought and emotion is what is : is the the most lush way to live , because then you 're adaptive"
No, thought meditation therapy counseling hugging your puppy it . It creates a better balance between thought and emotion
Environment," , let that let that emotion , run rampant cry , you 're about to go , see your boss , and you know it 's not going to go well and you 're starting to do things that you know is emotion , running rampant , then use thought And breathing exercises turn the"
Environment," safe place to let my emotions run wild right , a safe environment , yeah ! That 'S that 's the way i approach uh , the intersection of thought and emotion . Yeah , i think uh , you said emotional regulation i feel like is for me one of the most powerful skills"
No," that someone can learn in relationships and career in driving . You know on the street with other people around emotions are dominant by them , yes , which is great , but so it 's usually emotional regulation , not thought regulation right , but learning"
No," anatomy relative yeah . It 'S the more of the main focus of the brain . Obviously , if it was taken out , it would regulate but um emotionally . If the emotion is , if you 're always in reaction mode , you see something ah you 're in freak out mode you 're in screen mode you 're in i 'm"
No," Yeah it just so everybody 's got to have an individual approach to that . So here 's the two things about emotions , there 's uh . We could cut out the thinking just to put it coarsely , you can cut out the"
No," thinking . Brain and you 'll still be alive . You , if you somehow were able to take out that middle part of the brain . There is no life left . There 'S the consciousness relies on . Emotions on emotions , consciousness relies on emotions yeah because"
No, So what we want people to not wash their hands 150 times a day or have tourette 's or sometimes depression or sometimes a drive for obesity or certain tremors . We take a little catheter and just the tip is n't
No," emotional drug , oh my gosh ! So you 're sticking it in through the middle of the brain and what happens and then the tip with just a little pulse like the brain 's pacemaker and it changes the electro . So it 's not it 's not brand new , i"
No," brain stimulation on our own ? Oh , that 's a good question . Let me let me answer the first one i 'll get back to that deep brain stimulation on our own is through paste breathing . Let 'S get back to that one breathing , meditation"
No," reason to be physiologically , not stressed if you can , and you come up with your coping maneuvers . What 'S more interesting is with the intersection of the uh , the frontal lobes , the thinking brain and the emotional brain is that emotions are they 're coming in"
No," favored , they 're , always hot this . The thinking brain has to do more of the work and at some point , if you are not able to cultivate emotional regulation , it becomes a feed forward thing , because"
No," the connections start to sever . And then you start having this emotional brain , that 's no longer being tapped down or paced or controlled by the thinking brain . So emotional regulation is the life skill"
No," to so that 's the answer about emotional regulation . Do emotions have more power over thoughts or thoughts , but have more power over emotions . We start off with uh . The emotions are generally on overdrive compared to thought so thinking through emotions , thinking"
No," that 's all emotional regulation right uh thought was losing teenagers . I miss it . Actually , it was a wild time yeah , but then thought comes into balance , emotion , your reflection and thinking yeah . So take that thing that you know happens . Take my explanations : if they , if they 're"
No," of value to you and then say , let me now , let me take the wheel of that thing . That happened without me , actually choosing or driving right that maturity happens on its own . Now let me take the wheel of that process and try to do it"
No," for the rest of my life every year . Every moment , and not just say , hey whatever i got at 18 19 is , is who i am going back to your first thing . You'Re new every day , so it 's a responsibility to cultivate that emotional regulation through thought and"
No," of course you 're just emotionally over the top , and we know that 's what 's been going on the last couple years and even today , so but that . But that leaves you a flexibility and it also leaves you without feeling"
No," after right , so emotional regulation um the shortcut . So now we 're getting to like . Is there a tip ? You know , because i hope people feel like wait a second , this everything is possible"
No," , but what if there is n't a spot that we find and their seizures are horrible and it 's well before thinking about removing half the brain , so what they we would do . Is we make a reverse question mark incision , it 's just scalp , it 's not very tender ."
No," that we see when we give valium , which is an anxiolytic , their anxiety level goes down . Their electricity goes from fast to medium . Remember . We started this and we 're talking about athletes not wanting to be in fast . We want to be in the flow state"
No," measurable changes in the electricity there for the mind , so meditative breathing that for thousands of years , people have said can help you chill out is an anxiolytic and break anxiety . Well , we have proof of that now and i think that 's important"
No," give yourself anxiety by just doing that yeah . I thought that just for a second i 'm showing you the proof on the other side , do the opposite of hyperventilation and you 'll . Make yourself less frenetic ."
No," Will that solve your relationship problems ? No , i 'm not sure . Will that make you not want to get in a fight with your boss ? I 'M not sure , but you should know that that puts you at your most in command of your emotions , your emotional regulation , that 's a great"
No," emotional stress , anxiety , depression . All these different things . You wear yourself out . What i 'm hearing you say is emotional regulation is at the core of these things . I think so and it 's the rarest skill to cultivate in the most important"
No," really manic or really depressed , the treatment is an ion lithium . It 'S it 's bipolar , wow and for decades it 's on the periodic"
No," table . Next to all the other ones like hydrogen and it 's an ion . It 'S it 's stardust , star dust , lithium , it 's cheap right ! It 'S a pill and it can bring down your mania and it can lift your depression really . So there"
No," i 'm not , i ca n't i do n't judge um , i inform you yeah it 's ever up to people what they want to do , but i guess abundant and peaceful , loving life . You know , like all that . Well i mean i . If that 's your ambition , i think you"

No," Then there 's thinking thoughts , not just brain health but thinking health yeah . I like that exactly because it 's not a pump . You know right , it 's thought : health yeah . I like that , and now before we get to the electricity up here , that we 've touched on a lot . We'Ve"
Environment," What seems to help everything and people are n't going to like this answer , but it is , is uh , exercise right , yeah of course , and exercise on um in a way where you 're also thinking there are these cool things like they had people running on a treadmill and"
No," and we they got it . I had n't played dude . It might be my son 's life . This is why dad you do n't play board games with us or sports with us , because you 're insanely competitive . I was just like okay , that it 's it 's a fun game , yeah yeah , but so"

No," think about where they will be at age 49 having the tools some of the tricks , having had the diet that has preserved their flesh , the best likely to have staved off dementia a little bit like those things we do Now , as a less in my opinion , that 's a lesson"
No," um . The third thing is just what we talked about : i 'd love to equip them with mind health tools um , so that would be a certain type of diet , good food , i 'm not talking about being"
No," skinny or fat or heavy or obese or or under i 'm not talking about Any of those things the things you eat , regardless of your weight , can help preserve the flesh of your brain and that 's the mediterranean diet . So i would have"
No," older , so you 're born with the biggest block of marble wow and you shave , you shave off what you do n't use , because The brain is an energy hog right , so it wants to be efficient ."
No," people have children with intellectual physical disabilities , but similarly , getting them physically is teaching them how to do somersaults , putting them in a not that they 're going to be gymnasts , hand stands and Backflips and but some sort of sporting"
No," that separate from the junk foods separate from all the other bad stuff . You might eat or good i mean it 's delicious man - happiness important . I eat some . I eat some junk food , but i have tried hard since i learned about this - to to be on the mediterranean diet , yeah"
Environment," lots of movement and coordination , training to keep uh keep those neurons engaged and then um eat plants yeah to keep the flesh going . What do you feel like is uh i 've heard from one"
No," people um without having to cut them open , that 's right , prevention , yeah , yeah or noninvasive treatments like i 'm , i 'm trying to invent those i 'm trying to"
No," and they had 80 80 reduction in in refractory depression , so you 're depressed , you 've taken all the pills . Things are difficult and you 've considered suicidal thoughts or yeah . Well , that 's that 's an issue . Let me get on that one"
No," gizmo there 's , always a there 's , always a dark side to being manipulated by some of these . So what you 're saying by technology they 've already been doing studies on this , where 80 reduction on depression , yeah powerful from just the electronic"
No," shock , a gentle for what shock therapies for severe depression ? For what 30 minutes or five minutes ? Is this 10 minute episodes space by time ? Over most of the day , but you know you got to spend some time but five days"
No," thinking , feeling and emotions are all sort of electrical flows . Oh my gosh , this is this is my jam . I love this stuff man , i 'm so excited , but there 's a lot of room for you know : there 's a lot of room for exploitation when you 're cool language like that , because it 's"
Environment," , otherwise you would n't put a a little battery in the controlled medical environment and break depression , and otherwise you would n't you know , be in shock therapy . It 'S still some of these"
No," what 's your website where they can learn more about it all um . Obviously , just i would just you know , just google , because you see a lot of different things like that yeah . You know my website is n't really the conduit , but i 'm i 'm a cancer surgeon at city of hope , yeah and then"
No," happy healthy life family all that stuff , but for whatever reason , you 've got to take all of your message with you to the next place . It 'S your last day , you got to turn the lights off . There 'S no more electricity in the brain and you move on to the next place ."
No," , of course , between friends and lovers and and parents . Even you know the children , that 's what i got baby man . I want to acknowledge you for a moment for putting your message out there in a way"
No," complete 90 degree or 360 degree change , despair , anxiety , shame thinking ! I am shame thinking . I have no selfesteem thinking . I ca n't do this . That 'S okay."
No," They come in many forms, from charcoalinfused lemonades to detox teas, and they often have a hefty price tag. The idea of cleansing isn't anything new it's been around for thousands of years. For centuries, medicine and religion were deeply intertwined, and there was a lot of focus on ridding the body"
No," of impurities and sickness related to bad or imbalanced humors. Bloodletting, purging, fasting they were all wellregarded treatments. Today, the wellness industry has picked up on our desire to rid ourselves of things. They've taken the word ""detox,"" the medical treatment for people with drug and alcohol addictions,"
No," or removed as waste in the bile or via the kidneys, usually in the form of urine. Let's look at what happens when the liver encounters some specific substances. What about alcohol? That’s a substance that’s fine in smaller, moderate amounts but becomes poisonous in excess."
No," When we drink, alcohol passes through our liver, and the liver breaks it down in three steps. First, enzymes convert the alcohol to acetaldehyde, a substance that can damage cells over time. But acetaldehyde is quickly converted into acetate, a much more stable intermediate, before it breaks down into carbon dioxide and water."
Environment," because you aren't eating much. At worst, you could go into starvation mode. You could throw off your electrolyte balance, not to mention disrupt your intestinal flora and bowel function. Clearly, having a healthy liver is extremely important. The best things you can do: don't smoke, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly and get lots of sleep,"
No," but there are some more liver specific things to do. Don't consume too much alcohol, as it can cause a variety of problems over time, from fatty liver disease to cirrhosis of the liver, to liver cancer. Read the warning labels on medications as some can damage your liver when you don't take them as directed."
Environment," So many things are sold to us as selfcare, and cleanses are no exception, but I believe the best selfcare is just learning more about our bodies. That way, we can tune out all the noise and make informed decisions on what we really need."
Environment," With Athletic Greens, I can be sure that I'm getting all the vitamins and minerals that I need. So if I'm missing anything in my diet, I can compensate for that with the Athletic Greens. Plus it has the probiotics and prebiotics that can also compensate for any deficiencies that I might have in creating the right environment"
No," and is perfectly suited for people who are following a ketogenic, low carbohydrate, or paleo diet. LMNT contains a sciencebacked electrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium."
Environment," whether or not you were a preemie baby or not, whether or not you had pets at home, whether or not you were allowed to play in the dirt, whether or not you were allowed to eat snails or whether or not you were kept in a very antiseptic environment. All of those experiences"
Environment," through breathing, through kissing, and through skin contact. In fact, one of the major determinants of our microbiome is who we interact with and the environment that we happen to be in. And that actually includes whether or not we interact with animals."
Environment," In a little bit, I'll talk about some data as to whether or not you grew up in a home that had animals, whether or not you grew up in the home, whether or not there was a lot of social contact, meaning skin contact, or whether or not you grew up in a more animal sparse, contact sparse environment"
No," In fact, if you ask a neurobiologist what the role of the microbiome is, they'll tell you almost certainly that it's there to impact brain function. But if you have friends that are microbiologists, such as I do, they'll tell you, well, maybe the brain and nervous system are there"
Environment," Nonetheless, they are taking advantage of the different environments all along your digestive tract. They are taking advantage of the sorts of social interactions, for instance, the people you talk to and that breathe on you,"
No," and what I'd like to talk about now, is what those little microbiota are actually doing in your digestive tract. In addition to just living there for their own intents and purposes, they are contributing, for instance, to your digestion. Many of the genes that those microbiota make"
No," are genes that are involved in fermentation and genes that are involved in digestion of particular types of nutrients. And in a little bit, we will talk about how what you eat can actually change the enzymes that those microbiome components make, enzymes largely being things"
No," that are responsible for digestion. They catalyze other sorts of cellular events but in the context of the digestive pathway, we're talking about enzymes that help digest your food. So those microbiota are indeed helping you in many ways. And if you lack certain microbiota that can help you digest,"
No," And that might sound like a bad thing, but all types of sedatives, for instance, alcohol, and a lot of neurons that naturally make GABA can help quiet certain circuits in the brain, for instance, circuits responsible for anxiety. In people who have epilepsy, the GABAergic neurons, as they're called,"
No," brain function, and digestion. So that should give you a fairly complete picture of your gut microbiome. Now I'd like to talk about how your microbiome and your brain communicate, or more accurately, how your microbiome and the rest of your nervous system communicate."
Environment," and the microbiota, and thereby can send signals up to the brain by way of a long wire that we call an axon, and can communicate what the chemistry and what the nutritional quality and what the other aspects of the environment are at the gut at a given location up to the brain"
No," or really good ice cream or I got this thing for donuts that seems to just not quit although I don't tend to indulge it very often, I do like them. If I eat that particular food, obviously digestion starts in the mouth."
No," within the brain, neural circuits that include what we call the brain stem autonomic center. So it tends to make you feel alert and quite, we say, high levels of autonomic arousal. If you haven't eaten in a while, you might think that you just get really exhausted, right? Because we all hear that food is energy"
No," and caloric energy is what we need to burn, but you actually have a lot of energy stored in your body that you would be able to use if you really needed energy. But typically if we haven't eaten in a while, we start to get agitated and we get agitated by way way of release"
No," And this will become important later when we talk about tools for optimizing your gut microbiome for healthy eating and for health healthy digestion and for healthy brain function. I want to take a moment and talk about glucagonlike peptide 1, which is also called GLP1."
No," GLP1 is made by neurons in the gut and by neurons in the brain. This is a fairly recent discovery but it's an important one. GLP1 tends to inhibit feeding and tends to reduce appetite. There are a number of drugs released on the market now,"
No, It's also being used as a drug to reduce obesity. And it seems pretty effective at least in certain populations. There are certain foods and substances that increase GLP1. I've talked about a few of these on the podcast. One that I'm a particular fan of for entirely other reasons is yerba mate tea can stimulate the release of GLP1.
No, which is the utilization of fat stores for energy and so forth. A brief mention about yerba mate. There are some reports out there that yerba mate can increase certain types of cancers. The data that I've seen on this is that it tends to relate to whether or not
No," But that GLP1 is another one of these guttobrain signaling mechanisms that adjusts appetite that is dependent on diet, depends on what you eat or drink, and that the GLP1 pathway does seem particularly sensitive to the constituents of diet."
No," There's at least one quality study I was able to find showing that the ketogenic diet for instance, which almost always involves ingestion of very low levels of carbohydrate can increase GLP1. Although, as I mentioned before,"
No," there are other foods that fall outside the range of what we would consider ketogenic that can also stimulate GLP1, and as I mentioned, there are prescription drugs, like semaglutide, there are other ones as well now, that stimulate GLP1."
No," that we associate with feeding behavior. So I use GLP1 as an example of a pathway that you might choose to tap into by ingestion of yerba mate or by ingestion of the foods I mentioned, or if it's something that interests you, ketogenic diet. But I also mention it simply"
No," that your brain works. And this raises for me a memory of the episode that I did with Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who's a world expert colleague of mine at Stanford, who is expert on things like hormones and behavior. But we got into the topic of free will, which is a bit of a barbed wire topic"
No," I started feeling really not well. I felt, you know, kind of feverish, but my gut didn't feel well, my digestion was really off. All of that kind of information is handled in the prefrontal cortex at a conscious level, but the immediate decision to stop eating"
No," But it turns out the area postrema, this vomit center in the brain stem, is chockablock full of dopamine receptors. And if dopamine levels go too high, it can actually trigger vomiting. And this we see in the context of various drugs that are used to treat things like Parkinson's."
No," Parkinson's is a deficiency in dopamine or a lack of dopamine neurons typically that causes a resting tremor, difficulty in movement, because dopamine's also associated with a lot of the neural circuits for movement. Many drugs that are used to treat Parkinson's"
Environment," In other words, the foods you eat, the environment of your gut microbiome, can actually create the chemical substrates that allow your brain to feel one way or the other, to feel great or to feel lousy, to seek out more of a particular type of behavior or to avoid that behavior."
Environment," or by ingestion of particular foods or drugs, et cetera. So bacillus and serratia tend to increase our baseline levels of dopamine. So if it turns out that we are creating the right gut microbiome environment that these particular gut microbiota can thrive in, well, then our baseline levels of dopamine will be elevated"
No," this inhibitory neurotransmitter that can act as a little bit of a mild sedative, can reduce irritability, et cetera, but that's just the baseline, the kind of tide of those neuromodulators. Again, I want to emphasize that we still have neurocircuits within the brain and body"
Environment," maybe even thousands by this point, mostly performed in animal models, typically mice, but also some studies in humans that show that creating the correct environment for these gut microbiota to thrive really does enhance mood and wellbeing. And that when our gut microbiome is not healthy,"
Environment," which is coming out immediately after this one, the following Monday, that is. But for now I want to just capture a few of the main points about the early establishment of the gut microbiome. It turns out that the environment that we are exposed to, the things that come into contact with our skin"
No," is established, that those gut microbiota take residence within the gut. So it will depend on whether or not they were breastfed or bottle fed. It'll depend on whether or not they were exposed to a household pet or not, whether or not they were held by multiple caregivers"
Environment," or just by one, whether or not they were a preemie baby and were contained in a particularly restrictive environment in order to encourage their further development before they could be brought home or not. I don't want to give the picture that if you were isolated or you were delivered by Csection,"
No," and for sake of the immune system. There are some decent studies showing that if children are exposed to a lot of antibiotic treatment early in life, that can be very detrimental to establishment of a healthy gut microbiome. And fortunately that reestablishing a healthy gut microbiome"
No," can help rescue some of those deficits. So doctors nowadays are much more cautious about the prescription of antibiotic drugs to children in their early years, not just up to three years, but extending out to five and seven and 10 years. And even in adults, they're very, very careful about that, or they ought to be."
No," that can impact mood and mental health, impact immune health, and so on. As I mentioned earlier, there are hundreds if not thousands of studies emphasizing the key role of the microbiome on brain health, psychiatric health, et cetera. I want to just highlight a few of those studies"
Environment," that were in germ freeenvironments or nongermfree environments, or they exposed mice to particular microbiota and not other microbiota and they discovered that a particular microbiota called L. reuteri, it's L. REUTERI."
No," Treatment with L. reuteri corrects the social deficits present in these autism models and it does so by way of activating our old friend the vagus nerve, but not simply because the vagus nerve triggers the release of dopamine, but it turns out that this particular gut microbiota"
No," but rather it was in the context of colitis. This dates back to studies in the '50s, whereby people with very severe intractable colitis for which no other treatment was going to work received fecal transplants. So yes, that's exactly as it sounds. Taking the stool of healthy people who do not have colitis,"
No," One of the more powerful and salient examples is for obesity. There's some people for which even if they ingest very low numbers of calories, even if they go on a liquid protein diet, simply can't lose weight. These are somewhat rare disorders"
Environment," that donor's particular microbiota. So these microbiota can create positive outcomes or they can create negative outcomes. Now, most of us of course, are not interested in or pursuing fecal transplants. Most people are interested in just creating a healthy gut microbiome environment"
No, for sake of immune system and brain function. And we will talk about how to do that in just a few minutes. But I just want to further underscore the power of the microbiota in shaping brain chemistry and in shaping things like mood or other aspects of mental health that typically we don't associate with our gut.
No," It's an interesting study. Looked at 184 community dwelling adults, excuse me, ranging from 28 to 97 years old. They explored whether or not having enhanced microbial diversity somehow related to these variables that they refer to as loneliness and wisdom."
No," PANAS stands for positive affect negative affect schedule. This is a test that my lab has used extensively, that other labs to use to evaluate mood and wellbeing. And they defined what were called three enterotypes, three different categories of people that ate very different diets that tended to fall into categories of having more"
No," or fewer emotional symptoms that were negative or more fewer emotional symptoms that were positive and whether or not they tend to be more depressed, anxious, or have more stressrelated behaviors, et cetera. And what they were able to derive from this study was some strong indications about what types of things we should ingest in our diet,"
No," maybe even certain things that we should avoid, but certainly the types of things that we should ingest, that can enhance mood and wellbeing and can tend to shift people away from more depressivelike anxiety and stressrelated symptoms. Before we get into what the particular food items were"
No," But is it simply the case that adding microbiota diversity is always a good thing? Well, that doesn't seem to be the case. Probiotics and prebiotics, both of which can enhance microbiotal diversity, can improve mood, digestion, immune system, and so on. That's been established but it's mainly been established"
No," in the context of postantibiotic treatment or people that are recovering from illness or people that have been very stressed or have been dealing with all sorts of challenges, mental or physical, and they are an attempt to replenish the gut microbiome. However, it's also clear"
No," if we didn't have that opportunity. We just can't time travel and do that. All of us, however, should be seeking to improve the conditions of our gut microbiome because of the critical ways in which it impacts the rest of our brain and bodily health. So what should we do, what shouldn't we do?"
No," but is fiber really necessary and how necessary is it to encourage a healthy microbiome? Clearly, there are a number of people following relatively low fiber diets, such as ketogenic diets, and those can have, in some cases, antiinflammatory effects and can sometimes"
Environment," but they replenish other ones that then in turn encourage the development of the microbiota that you do want once you start eating the appropriate foods. So they change the environment which makes the environment better, which indirectly supports the proliferation"
No," that fasting is neither good nor bad. You start to get the picture that particular diets, meaning certain restriction diets or macronutrientrich diets may not be good or bad for the microbiome. And yet there are some answers that arrive to us from Dr. Sonnenburg, but from other experts in the field,"
No," This is a study that was carried out by the Sonnenburg lab in collaboration with Chris Gardner's lab, also at Stanford, where they compared two general types of diets in humans, diets that were fiber rich, which has been proposed time and time again to enhance microbiota diversity and to enhance gutbrain signaling even"
No," and to enhance the immune system perhaps, and diets that were enriched in socalled lowsugar fermented foods. Before I dive into that study and what the conclusions were because they are very interesting and very actionable for all of us, I do want to touch on probiotics"
No," and powder form prebiotics and probiotics that can be very useful. Or in cases where people have been very stressed or are undergoing excessive travel or have shifted their diet radically, maybe that's due to travel, maybe that's due to illness,"
No," or their system is generally stressed for environmental or illnessrelated reasons that it might be useful to lean towards higher doses of prebiotics or probiotics than one might normally use but that under normal conditions, that one would focus on quality nutrients through diet and focus on ingestion of probiotics"
No," I mean the foundational things that really set us up for overall health. So this is going to be getting deep sleep of sufficient duration 80 plus percent of the time. I mean, if you could get a hundred percent of the time, that'd be great but very few people accomplish that. It's going to be proper hydration."
No," Now, this is a very interesting study. It was done on humans. There were two major groups. One group of humans was instructed to increase the amount of fiber in their diet and in fact ate a high fiber diet. The other group was instructed to eat a high fermented food diet."
No," However, after this ramp up period, the group assigned to the high fiber condition maintained high fiber intake for six weeks and the high fermented food group maintained high fermented food intake for six weeks after which they went off either the high fiber or the high fermented food diet"
No," The immune system has a lot of different molecules involved. I did a whole episode about the immune system if you're interested in learning what some of those molecules are, various cytokines and signaling molecules that reflect either high inflammation states or reduced inflammation states in the brain and body."
No," was that contrary to what they predicted, the high fiber diet did not lead to increased microbiota diversity, at least not in all cases. And that was somewhat surprising. You know, the idea is that prebiotic fiber and a lot of the material in fruits and vegetables"
No," but it does point to the fact that increasing fiber intake did not increase microbiota diversity, which in general, as I mentioned before, is associated with improvements in microbiota function, health, and overall wellbeing. Now, the high fermented food diet condition was very interesting."
No," that comes out next week, we talk a lot about the particular value that brine might hold in terms of bringing about microbiota diversity because of the richness of live cultures that it contains. I do want to focus for a moment on the high fiber condition because there were some interesting observations"
No," both showed reductions in baseline microbiota diversity although to varying degrees. So I don't want to paint the picture that fiber is bad but fiber certainly did not have the positive effects on microbiota diversity that the high fermented food diet did. So my read of this study,"
No," we do have to be considerate of cost because certain things like kombuchas, for instance, can be quite costly. I should also mention some kombuchas actually contain alcohol, some do not, or contain very little amounts of alcohol. One way to avoid the high cost of fermented foods"
Environment," putting water in there, some salt, covering it, and then keeping it in a particular environment, and then routinely scraping off some of the material from the surface. You have to do that in order to make sure that you're not getting microbes and things growing in it that are bad for you."
No," what we call housekeeping functions. But when there's a lot of inflammation in the body, when there's a massive immune response, the microglia can be hyperactivated and that's thought to lead to any number of different cognitive defects or challenges thinking, or maybe even some forms of neurodegeneration over time,"
No," of the digestive pathway, and how that digestive pathway harbors microbiotal species, meaning many, many little bacteria that can signal all sorts of things to the rest of the brain and body. And indeed, we talked about the various ways they do that. We talked about direct pathways, literally nerve networks that extend from the gut"
No," based on some of the other positive effects of fasting, or if we're not just discussing fasting, some other types of somewhat restrictive diets either restrictive in time or restrictive in terms of macronutrient intake, how those may or may not improve the health of gut microbiome."
No," And the basic takeaway was that because we don't know exactly how specific diets impact the gut microbiome, and we don't know how fasting either promotes or degrades the microbiome, we really can't say whether or not they are improving or degrading the microbiome at this time. However, it is clear that stress,"
No," or working excessively, you're not getting enough sleep, or your diet is radically changed from normal. And we talked about how increasing the amount of fiber in your diet might be useful for increasing fiber digesting enzymes and the assimilation of fibrous foods"
No," And I am by no means a skilled cook or chef and basically have no culinary skill whatsoever. So if I can do it, you can do it. I hope you found this information useful and perhaps also actionable. One of my motivations for doing this episode was, again, as a primer for the episode"
No," We hear about the gut as a second brain and so forth. But I think for many people, they don't really have a clear picture of what the gut microbiome is and the pathways and mechanisms by which it can signal to the brain and to the other parts of the body. So I hope that today's information at least improved"
No," the clarity around that topic and leaves you with a more vivid picture of this incredible system that is our gutbrain axis.

No," the coast or inland . Their diet varied eating from 54 to 80 animal protein 13 to 40 fat and from 5 to 33 wild fibrous carbohydrates . Lo and behold , they lost weight . The insulin resistance , the high blood pressure , the high cholesterol , everything normalized when they"
No," reestablished their former traditional lifestyles . All this improvement came in just seven weeks on a diet , predominantly animal in origin , an average of 64 animalbased foods and , interestingly enough"
Environment, exercise was not a factor in their improvements . Professor o'day determined that the group was actually less physically active in the bush than in the city . A current test of a traditional method of eating 's ability to restore health
No," has been undertaken by canadian physician , dr jay wartman , who became interested in the relationship between diet and diabetes in the first nations peoples of canada . First , nations are one of the aboriginal peoples in canada and they have terrible"
No," problems with obesity , metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes , and i think it 's got a lot to do with the change . A dramatic change from a traditional diet to a modern diet . That is not a very healthy diet . The traditional diet in this part of the"
No," world was very low in carbohydrates and it consisted of game seafood , all kinds of fish and some wild edible plants , usually seasonable seasonal plants like berries and certain greens that are eaten at certain times of the year . But a diet"
No," , that 's very low in starch and sugar content , and so it got me interested in the modern , low carbohydrate diet . So i looked at the research in low carbohydrate diets and found that people who had diabetes or metabolic"
No," syndrome or just obesity benefited a lot from being on modern on a modern , low , carbohydrate diet . So i got interested in that relationship . The traditional diet , the fact that it was low in carbohydrates , the change in that diet , which is a big"
No," big increase in carbohydrates and the advent of these these diseases . In my travels , i go into a lot of remote communities and meet with people . I started questioning the elders about the diet . What was your"
No," , what were your traditional foods ? What kinds of foods did you eat ? I started collecting stories and it became very evident to me that their diet was very low on carbohydrate . Everybody was very interested and we 've selected a community where it looked"
No," in the niche , where i work with this diet with first nations people when i connect the dots for them and i say think about your traditional diet . Think about where your elders ate your ancestors and think about the foods that you eat"
No," today and how your diet has changed . The light bulbs go on , so i find it very rewarding to work in this population because they get it . They get it very quickly and it makes a lot of sense to them that"
No," the diet they 're eating today may in fact be the cause of a lot of the health problems they have , so that very strong resonance of this idea in this population gives me hope That we will make a difference with this"
No," seemed like a perfect opportunity to hear the current thinking in the vegetarian and vegan world for both the participants and the movement 's professional leaders , how you doing making a documentary call in search of"
No," the perfect human diet . Somebody want to talk to us about your magazine and what you do and why you 're here and all that good stuff , it 's a perfect fusion of both my passions , vegetarian lifestyle , even a focus on veganism"
No," and vegetables five a day six a day , eight a day , and i say no stop counting , do n't add fruits and vegetables to the core of your diet , make fruits and vegetables the diet . You follow that , then we can count what things we eat a couple of this or a"
No," couple that are n't fruits and vegetables , but most of what we eat should be fruits and vegetables , and our diet should be vegetablebased mistake that most vegetarians make is they think they Need to make up for the lack of dead , decaying flesh in the fact you do n't need to make"
No," carnivores the way our digestive system works , we 're actually better suited to be vegetarians , vegetarians , obviously , do n't eat meat and they they have a real problem with foods of animal origin . So if you advocate a lowcarb diet - and"
No," can do fine , but but for the most part , if you advocate a higher protein diet , you 're advocating a meat , diet and people that are vegetarians . Look for every reason"
No," on how to deal with patients on vegetarian diets , not to get them off the vegetarian diets , but how to uh . You know what kind of treatment problems you 're going to run into . I mean it 's an aberration . It 'S not the way of man , but we 've got a carnivorous gi tract ."
No," against the fact that our natural state is as vegetarian . It 'S nonsense . What is commonly referred to as the lowcarb diet . Recently , gaining wider media and medical acceptance reframed as low glycemic had its beginnings in 1863 , with the first popular diet book ever"
No, tie his shoes became winded with every slight exertion was losing his eyesight and hearing and had to walk downstairs backwards to avoid knee and ankle pain after 30 years of failure trying everything we 're still advised to Do
No," today , including reducing fat cutting calories and exercising more one doctor , finally prescribed a diet that advised him to quote abstain as much as possible from bread , butter , milk , sugar , beer and potatoes"
No," , which had been the mainstay of his diet for years and eat . Instead , three meals per day , primarily of meat , fish , poultry or game , very small amounts of dry toast and fruit , any vegetable except potatoes"
Environment," His eyesight and hearing improved . He could exercise freely and , yes , he could finally walk downstairs forwards with perfect ease . His book became a phenomenal success , ruffled the feathers of some in the medical community in popular press and his name became part"
No," of the queen 's english as a verb , meaning to diet . You know we know that banting came out with this diet in 1863 published it , but what how did the medical community respond and what people do n't realize is that"
No," for the most part , the medical community decided that banting was right . So these diets recommend meat and green vegetables , and that was the basis of a diet . If you went to the obesity , textbooks or the medical textbook , sir william osler , who was the most famous"
No," physician of the you , know , turn of the 20th century . The early years of the 20th century in his medical textbook , he says you know fat children come to see me or fat women come to see me . I tell them to give up carbohydrates , starches and"
No," sweets , and you get rid of added fats as well by which they meant butter lard . You know so you 're eating the basis of the medical establishment 's . Typical diet , through the 1960s would have been some"
No," amount of meat and green vegetables , every diet , restricted , carbohydrates and then the question was whether or not you 're going to restrict fats as well , and this is n't actually through 1910 , say from 1865 to 1965 for a century . If you went to a hospital and retreated"
No," for obesity , you were told to give up carbohydrates . Now , of course , it 's obvious to anyone following the media 's coverage of diet and health stories that the lowcarb prescription is not conventional medical advice"
No," , diet in the 1960s vanished to be replaced with the idea that dietary fat is a problem and carbohydrates are now not only are they heart healthy , but the basis Of a good , healthy diet is"
No," when she was raised , she was raised to believe that potatoes , bread , pasta , rice were fattening lo and behold , they 're not and you can eat As many of them as you want , and now a diet becomes weight , loss diet becomes exact opposite of what it was"
No," now . It 'S a weight loss diet is low in fat and high in carbohydrates , and particularly those carbohydrates that everybody believed was fattening until the 1960s . Bread , pasta , potatoes , just do n't put fat on it , do n't put butter on it , do n't put cheese"
No, on it . That 'S what makes you fat and the fascinating thing about this switch . This paradigm shift is that there was no evidence to support it . There was this belief that fat caused heart disease by its effect on cholesterol and nothing else .
No," You know absolutely nothing else . We changed at least a century of established wisdom on what constituted not just a healthy diet , but a weight reduction diet based on a belief that dietary fat caused heart disease ."
No," food plate are few , leaving it essentially the same as the old pyramid , but what does n't get much public attention is the methodology that has been used to create the us diet guidelines . The guidelines are based on a"
No," powerful idea in all of medicine and biology . It 'S only been within the last decade , maybe 15 years , that the scientific and nutritional communities have become aware that , indeed our nutritional requirements are shaped by our evolution . Probably about 1987 , i read"
No, football field to give human dietary evolution a sense of scale . Two million years ago was the very first appearance of a member or one of our ancestors called homo erectus . And so we believe that this is the first member
No," of the human genus homo , which means man , and we believe that this is a crucial step in the evolution of the human diet . So this is basically the starting point and we can go back a half million years earlier and that 's when the first stone"
No, tools were made . But the first appearance of people that were anatomically very similar to us from the head down starts about 2 million years ago . Then homo erectus leaves africa and
No," there is nothing to eat , but animal foods after we pick up the fossil record from damanissi in georgia , the homo erectus spreads throughout the rest of asia . They go east to a site in china roughly 165 million years ago . They spread all throughout asia up to"
No," diet . It takes a a degree of behavioral sophistication to be able to make a sharp stone . Stick to the end of the spear . Now did diet have anything to do with our sophistication . We believe that it does . We believe that , increasingly , we started to include more omega3 fatty"
No," acids in our diet . We believe that , as we became more and more dependent on omega3 fatty acids that also facilitated increased brain growth , increased behavioral sophistication so by following this dietary path . Here we were"
No," right . That 'S right ! With the industrial revolution , we started to include refined , sugars , refined grains and mixtures of these refined , sugars , refined , grains , refined oils . We call them processed foods . These are the ubiquitous foods in the typical american diet that comprise"
No," more than 70 percent of the average calories in the american diet . Right now , right 70 of everything that we eat stems from the industrial period . Essentially the industrial period forward and actually processed foods really did n't get going until about 1900 1920 . So"
No, Is it any wonder that we are having trouble with our diet ? We are so far off base from what we are genetically programmed to eat . The second leg of our search takes us to new york city first to meet with the american museum of natural history 's
Environment," environment , where these people lived all open grassland . What we call savannah there 's trees in the background , but it 's very open , very dangerous territory for them . So when we hear that the earliest modern humans came from africa and came from the"
No," they are now quickly . Our brain , however , took a while to catch up , however , with a high protein diet . That 'S what they had , that was the secret for encephalating , our brain and for the the"
Environment," This is a diorama that features uh anatomically modern humans , just like you and i , albeit uh , very primitive uh . If you look at the background , they 're living in a tundra environment , but they 've already constructed a house , a very interesting house made of uh"
No," means that their diet so to speak , is lean meat , any form of vegetation . They could get fruits berries , nuts , fish , okay , everything is coming from a world that was pristine"
No," superior , this kind of diet . This represents the preagricultural age . After that we start to decline . Things change things , change things change . The foods that were available to them in nature"
No," anthropologist and president of the foundation . Leslie aiello 's research focuses on the evolution of human adaptation , including evolution of diet , the brain language and cognition . What we call the ideal human diet depends on what we call human , because"
No," today and for probably five million years throughout that time period , if we saw one of these ancestors on the street , we 'd recognize them as a ape standing on two legs and their diet was correspondingly"
No," something definitely different about the diet of these ancestors at 2 or 17 million years ago . The question is what was different . Many of the earliest modern humans were actually also very big individuals , and so you know so this idea that our"
No," evidence in the skeletons of really nutritional and Deficiency that what we 're tracking is this reduction of the variety of variation in the diet . We are n't getting what we were we 're built to need , and i think that that 's the bottom line"
No," in 2003 at a symposium on the evolution of the human diet , the known the unknown and the unknowable at the university of arkansas , one remarkable development caught my attention . Above all , others presented that we were just now entering a period of exploding , scientific"
No," understanding with rapid changes in scientific technology , bringing to light new facts about the human diet that were previously unknowable . Three years later , when i was interviewing professor cordain , he said you really should talk to mike richards"
Environment," indeed me ? What was that interaction like , and here you would have had uh hundreds of thousands of years of neanderthals living here well adapted to this region , doing perfectly well , probably um and then income . These modern individuals did . How did they react ? What exactly happened"
No," well and thus far when it comes down to diet kenny ? Can you tell from besides the reindeer , obviously the animals that were here ? Can you tell us what they ate ? Well , that the evidence for the most part is going to come from the bones because that 's what 's preserved , you have a large"
Environment," they were , they were modern humans . They did they . They had a brain that was organized as far as we can tell like ours . So you have to imagine these neanderthals being uh extremely capable uh hunters extremely capable at uh surviving in this environment . They were"
No," uh . We live in a society which is very safe . We do n't have much accidents , although we have violence , it 's limited , and so we are mainly preoccupied with all the health problems related to our diet and our way of life . I think for the neanderthals are"
No," department of human evolution in leipzig , germany , professor mike richard 's research , involves the application of stable , isotope analysis of bone collagen to determine human and animal diets , as well as dietary changes in prehistoric and historic europe ."
No," things . But when you really think about it , you realize that these these diets are not so good for you at all . I run a group uh , that 's in a field called archaeological science , so we specialize in applying you know , sort of hard science techniques to"
No," anthropology archaeology . I understand you 're also working with early human diet . Here yeah , my main specialty is diet . I i study bone chemistry as a way of getting at what the diets of people and animals were in the past , and one of the main"
No," things we 're looking at is the evolution of diets through time . By trying to get this information from these bones themselves and doing scientific analysis of the composition of these bones , people have hypothesized that it 's a trait of like the first homo"
No," tools that are being used to cut up animals . You find butchered animal bones , but there 's no way to really tell what proportion of the diet that represented and plant foods just do n't survive , so they 're invisible . So we have to use this this kind of study looking"
No, directly at the fossils themselves or the bone chemistry to really prove what proportion of their diet was coming from animal protein versus plant protein . The first step is taking the sample that usually happens in the museum or in the field
No," whole sort of food web with isotope values . You see how they all fit in , but when we pick up the story with the neanderthals , which is the first time we can , then we do see really they are getting all their protein from animal sources . So , as predicted , we pick that up"
No," modern humans . So that 's the idea we have of a sort of pale , the paleolithic diet that we see it for modern humans . It 'S a lot of animal protein . I think i spent a lot of time working on neolithic and post neolithic sites as well , and there you really do see the humans with much"
No," lower nitrogen isotope values and they 're , clearly getting a lot of their protein from plants as agriculture yeah , but but before that , They had the same kind of values as the neanderthal yeah , except for this addition of these"
No," , so when you get really big villages , people crowding together and having a really high . I guess serial amount of cereals in their diet and you really see a difference in their bones and these diseases that you would never see and that you never saw in the"
No," evolutionary trajectory that made that how these humans evolved to this state , the modern humans . We got to be this way and it 's over you know , maybe a hundred thousand years of evolution to get to be the state of actually adapting to this diet being a huntergatherer moving"
Environment," around a lot um eating these wild foods . I think there 's no question that , for most of the time that we 've been around , we had a really um that kind of uh nomadic lifestyle with lots of sort of exercise and eating a lot of animal proteins , uh and some and wild plant"
Environment," foods . But if you just think of what 's being successful in terms of us as a species , we 've survived , you know 100 000 years and most of that 95 percent of that was . This kind of adaptation was eating these animal , these wild animal foods , plant foods with lots of exercise ."
No," think of it . That way i mean what we are adapted to is not what we 're living right now , this um kind of paleolithic diet , i guess , is probably the most optimum for for modern humans . It has to be it 's what you know"
No," we , you know evolutionary pressures got us towards you know , and we were successful in that kind of diet . So i think it is the it 's got to be the best diet for humans . If this way of eating is the best diet for humans , i wanted to understand"
No," every year . The doctor adds a new pill to your list and you 've got another problem and the hope starts to fade . I sort of break food into two categories : human food and nonhuman food and the human foods would be the lean meat , chicken , fish , turkey etc , preferably"
No," because they eat grains - and that happened when that began , and it follows the introduction of grains into the diet they bring in gluten . They bring in yeast . They cause a chronic inflammatory state of the gut and as a big initiator of almost all our"
No," chronic inflammatory diseases , autoimmune diseases , rheumatoid arthritis , virtually absent the archaeological record prior to the institution of grains into the diet . I try to get patients to realize what they need to do is to think about protein as time released . Glucose ."
No," Okay , you think about protein . The liver can take protein and turn it into glucose in a time release , fashion , work harder , makes more . Okay , that 's how we 're truly designed ? How beautiful is that , so you got steady energy all day long , but if you eat a bunch of carbohydrates"
No," , then the insulin level goes up and insulin goes to the liver and shuts off the conversion of protein into glucose . So now , if you had a steak for breakfast , you ca n't get to it for energy , you see , and so your in your sugars are going to start crashing pretty soon"
No," and at that point the only way to get it back up is either to rest a little Bit and you can you can sort of stuff more protein and then that 'll bring it up , but a lot of times at that point , they 're craving carbs . They want something quick , they want it now . They do n't feel good ."
No," the romaine lettuce is much better for you than the iceberg . Glass has a lot more in it , which is a lot more nutritional value . A lot more nutritional value and the color tells you an awful lot , the more color it 's got , the better it is for"
Environment," there 's still a lot of fruit sugar in fruit . There is right , fructose and fructose can do some bad things to you in high amounts right , especially if you 're diabetic exercise undoes that damage by the way and that 's another lecture . But this is a"
No," excellent source of especially of energy . Through the day , you know , eat half an apple in between a meal . It 'S great , you know and then eat the other half later or an orange . It does n't really matter , you should eat the orange and not the orange juice . Orange juice"
No," not found in nature . It 'S probably something completely manufactured . Our body knows nothing of what to do with it and often works as neurotransmitters in the brain that mess us or mess up our thinking , cause , fogging and thinking , etc , even shown to reduce depression ."
No," that allowed the brain to double in size , but over 25 of our energy is used in in the brain and uh , and i 've seen studies as high as 70 , depending on what Factors they 're looking at so we got this compact source of food , which"
No," perpetuate their wealth or what have you ? And instead of looking at the big picture ? They'Re , not thinking about their kids , their grandkids , i mean nutrition . Islam is saying that the children born today will not live their parents , because they 've"
No," never had good nutrition and i 've got 11 year old type . 2 . Diabetics type 2 is a dietary induced diet , dietary induced and when i first graduated medical school , i never saw anybody under"
No," 55 with type 2 diabetes . I'Ve got children , have n't even hit puberty yet and they 've got type 2 diabetes and , and so we 've made a lot of mistakes here , and hopefully we can turn this around"
No," my tenure . Global search for the perfect human diet has been an amazing and enlightening treasure hunt revealing a wealth of ancestral and traditional dietary insights , as well as the most recent anthropological understandings of our species , dietary evolution ."
No," health strength and brain power to become the dominant species on the planet . We can now clearly see that whenever and wherever domesticated grains and plant foods became our species major source of protein , our health declined and that"
No, animal proteins and fats are irreplaceable in an optimal human diet . This knowledge is a game changer . Clearly the prevailing media and government message is that meat and animal protein are inherently unhealthy and we should be eating less .
No, But i hope that what we 've learned on our search will elevate and inspire the public conversation to include the fullest range of what is now known about the authentic human diet and that it will eventually be enthusiastically embraced by our government officials
No," decided to publicize it or make it famous , and so let 's see , could a Fad diet be something that our ancestors were eating for thousands of years . I do n't think that fits into the word fad . I did n't invent this diet . All we did is we"
No," uncovered what was already there ? We uncovered the diet that all human beings ate on this planet until 10 000 years ago , so we did detective work in finding out what that diet is . But do n't attribute this diet to me . There will be other scientists that will come along"
No," , but the fundamental tenet of this diet will not be ever be shown to be wrong because it 's based upon our genes and it 's based upon evolution through natural selection . I think you have to go back to what we are being most successfully adapted to to"
Environment," this point , so i think the process i mean the refined sugars you 're going to get rid of those . I think you have to have more exercise that has to be built . In i mean our paleolithic humans were moving around all the time . There 'S a lot of exercise . I"
No," biology that our ancestors did and that biology is uh oriented toward the lifestyle , including the diet that they enjoyed at that time . Very often the word convenience come up comes up , you know this is not convenient , that 's not"
No," full story of our dietary evolution , it made sense to embrace the perfect human diet 's , optimal method of eating in order to live a full , healthy and happy life , especially given my heart condition . I'Ve been eating this way for more than five years now and much to the amazement"
No," of my doctors . My blood work clearly illustrates . That was absolutely the right decision , but what gives me the most hope that we can solve our epidemic of obesity and chronic disease ? Is that there is both a new groundswell"
No," of interest in ancestral health and more practicing physicians , like dr lane sebring are successfully using these evolutionary nutrition principles with patients proving daily that eating a perfect human diet of human foods and"
No," advantage of these crucial discoveries . This is a method of eating . Any of us can adopt beginning with our next meal . As david gedoff pointed out earlier , there are those who will cry that this is just another fad diet , a passing obsession that will be"
No," forgotten in a few short years . But when i asked lauren kerdin 's colleague dr boyd eden about that misconception , i think he summed it up perfectly . If this is a fad diet , then it 's a two million year old fad."
No," One of the most popular guests in the history of this podcast, Dr. Will Bulsiewicz is a board certified awardwinning gastroenterologist and the New York Times bestselling author of ""Fiber Fueled"". Dr. B has authored more than 20 articles"
No," Our first episode checkout episode 538, if you missed, it spent a lot of time focused on the why behind gut health. Well, this episode picks up where that one left off, focusing more on the how, how to eat optimally, how the microbiome affects cognition, brain health, mental health, and many other fascinating topics."
No," is gonna rock your world. So please hit that subscribe button and let us now take a fantastic voyage into the mysteries of the microbiome with Dr. Will Bulsiewicz. Dr. B is in the house. How you doing, man? I'm great."
No," they're in the soil obviously. Everything that's alive in this planet either is a microbiome or has a microbiome. Those are the two choices. So everything has a microbiome. And I thought like a tumor would be, you know, I mean a sterile mass of cells."
No," And a few years ago, they discovered that tumors, cancer tumors, actually have their own microbiome. Wow. Separate from the gut microbiome, they have their own microbiome and they took this further. They were taking a look at pancreatic cancer,"
No," which is one of our most deadly cancers. And they analyzed the microbiome of the tumor, not the person's gut microbiome, of the tumor, and discovered that a person who has a low diversity within the tumor microbiome has a worse prognosis or a lower likelihood of survival relative to the person whose tumor has a high diversity."
No," And so they continued down this path to look into this in more detail. And there have been a number of major discoveries. First, in acute myeloid leukemia, one of the treatments that they will give people are stem cell transplants. And it's basically trying to throw hail Mary"
No," If you have high diversity within your personal gut microbiome and you receive the stem cell transplant, your survival is actually much better. By conversely if the diversity of the microbiome with respect to the tumor is high that would correlate negatively with treatment receptivity."
No," Is that what you're saying? So if the microbiome on the tumor is very diverse and robust, then it's gonna be much more treatment resistant. No, actually more treatment. Or actually actually it does better. Oh, I see."
No," 'Cause I was thinking the diversity of that microbiome is there to support the tumor growth. So the less resistant it is than the weaker it is. No, actually, so in both cases, a more diverse microbiome whether it's inside the tumor or whether it's the patient's actual gut microbiome, in both cases, a more diverse gut microbiome"
No," that's just from a couple weeks ago. A few years ago, MD Anderson did a study where they gave antibiotics or they looked at the effect of antibiotics immediately prior to receiving this treatment for melanoma. Antibiotics reduced diversity Sure. Right."
No," Within the gut microbiome. And what they found is that in doing this, they actually were reducing the effectiveness. That's fascinating. Of their treatment. Taking in a step further, they then took a group of people"
No," after the immunotherapy for melanoma on the high fiber diet. Wow. And when they broke this down, so check this out. This is where like my mind is blown. When I saw this. For every five grams that you increased your fiber consumption you increase your survival by 30%."
No," That's an insane number. That's crazy. So the most general takeaway from that is if you are suffering from cancer and you're about to undergo treatment or you're currently undergoing treatment, you should be boosting your fiber"
No," of that in terms of like how it can be manipulated to produce a favorable outcome with respect to treatment. So I haven't seen any research specifically looking at the use of the tumor microbiome to create interventions that can improve cancer care, this has become a very hot topic within the cancer space"
No, and there's more research that's ongoing because first they did this study with the pancreatic cancer showing that you lived longer if you had a high diversity of your tumor microbiome. And so now what they're doing is they're looking at different types of tumors. Step one is you first sort of describe what you're seeing
No," and then step two is gonna be, so how do we manipulate this? And they do believe that these microbes, Rich, are playing a role. This is part of the thought process here. They do believe that these microbes that are like literally a part of this tumor are playing a role in the ability of your cancer treatment,"
No," whatever it may be, whether it be chemotherapy or immunotherapy to actually get access to the tumor cells and basically disrupt them. Right. It would follow logically from the idea that fecal transplants"
No, can be at least temporarily effective. That with respect to say a skin cancer that there could be some kind of microbial topical ointment or treatment that could be rubbed on this or in turn for an internal tumor for there to be some kind of injection to the tumor with some kind of microbial solution
No," that would increase that diversity or somehow make that tumor a better candidate for treatment. I completely agree. And some of what they're saying, for example, the researcher out of MD Anderson, that's doing this melanoma research. What she said in this meeting recently is that she believes"
No," that as we continue to unpack this particular topic and understand this new finding, that the tumor has in microbiome, that this is going to like radically transform cancer care and allow us to become so much more effective than we currently are in terms of our therapeutics. Yeah."
No," And I also think that there are these planes of existence that it all depends on are you zooming out or are you zooming in. If you zoom in on our gut, you discover this community, this like thriving, vibrant community of microorganisms that are as alive as you and I are, Rich. And it's very hard for us like to conceptualize this"
No," and understand this because they're invisible to us, but they are there and they have personalities just like you and I do, they have clicks or like groups of friends, they have different skill sets and they have different dietary needs. So they're very, very similar"
No," I wanna turn attention for a few minutes and talk a little bit about our immune system and how our microbiome plays into that. When we did our first episode, it was early days of COVID and we talked a little bit about how to keep our immune systems healthy"
No," and to make sure that our microbiome is diverse as you know, something necessary to combat disease. Here we are, you know, two years later, we're sort of beginning to come out of this period. So I'm interested in what you've learned over the last two years in terms of, you know, how COVID has impacted us."
Environment," I mean, we've been in this era in which we've been forced to socially isolate, we've restricted our exposure to other human beings and a multiplicity of environments, we've over sterilized everything. This has to have an impact on not only our microbiome, but the robustness of our immune system"
No," where basically they gave these animals a highfiber diet versus a lowfiber diet. And the prediction of the scientists was that the high fiber diet, because it's antiinflammatory, that it would actually reduce the effectiveness of the immune system,"
No," and when they infect them with a respiratory virus, that these animals would be more prone to death because of the high fiber diet. They found the opposite. And when they went to unpack this, they were like, ""What is going on here?"" They dove deeper,"
No," enter the bloodstream, leave the gut, enter the bloodstream, travel to the lungs and in the lungs are actually able to manipulate the immune system to protect against this respiratory virus. So in these studies the mice that were on the high fiber diet, they were less likely to die,"
No," they had better lung function and they had less severe illness. Well, if you fast forward through the pandemic, you know, what's fascinating, Rich, is that for me as someone who really values high quality research information, I'm looking for trends. I'm not looking at single studies."
No," and looking at dietary patterns and health outcomes. And they found in this study that people who were eating a plantbased diet had a 73% reduced likelihood of having moderate to severe COVID19. That's amazing. Did that factor, was this prevaccination,"
No," So these were people that were unvaccinated and the pescatarian diet did pretty well as well. It was a 59% reduction of moderate to severe COVID19 among that group. Well, pescatarian diet, I mean, there's no meat, there is no dairy, there is no eggs, but there is fish, and there is a lot of plants."
No," Right. Right. Is it possible to interpret from that data, the extent to which the diversity of plant foods in the diet were the thing, moving the needle versus the absence of animal foods or other unhealthy foods or how do you parse that? It's one thing to just say"
No," the plantbased people did better, but what is actually the, like the active component in this? Well, we don't have the granularity to go into great detail about like, what was the diversity of plants within their diet? Sure. What we do know is that these are people"
No, that are eating a plantbased diet. And so the clear assumption there is that this is a highfiber diet relative to lowfiber diet. But then on the flip side what was interesting in this study is that there was an additional finding.
No," The people who did the worst had a specific dietary pattern as well. It was lowcarb. The people who were eating a lowcarb diet, again, they did the worst, plantbased did the best. And if you were to line this up and compare it lowcarb to plantbased,"
No," what you would discover is that the people who were consuming a lowcarb diet had a 3.8 times higher likelihood of developing moderate to severe COVID19. That's interesting. I would've thought the people who were doing the worst would be people who would be like on the McDonald's diet,"
No," which isn't necessarily lowcarb but just tons of processed foods and refined grains, et cetera. You know, I think Not so sure. It bring forth questions about the lowcarb diet. And we don't, with this particular study"
No," have the answers of what are the specifics of what was their lowcarb diet. But I think it's within reason to assume that people who described their diet as a lowcarb diet were doing a general ketogenic type diet, which in many cases is Is lowfiber."
No," Where you're basically reducing your plant intake, and you're going low on fiber and you're cranking up the animal products. Now, if we bring in a nutritionist who's highly facile in this space, could they craft, like could they craft a diet that's higher in fiber and yet still lowcarb?"
No," If we start getting a little more technical with the lowcarb diet, 'cause some people will do this and trying to protect the space Yeah, plantbased, lowcarb diet is a thing. That's right. And there's also like a Clean Kiddo,"
No," where, you know, you're specifically looking to get your dietary fiber and yet you're still predominantly getting your calories from fat. And, but there are still some issues with these types of diets. I mean, you can't do that without eliminating fruit."
No," You just can't. Right. Right. So that's interesting. So essentially the takeaway is the people who, if you can interpret that data, the takeaway would be that people who are amping up their fiber in their diet just fared better in general."
Environment," and they had them stick their hands into soil for two weeks. Like literally that's all they did. Right. They put their hands in the dirt, they weren't even gardening. They were just hands in the dirt for two weeks. And they had healthier gut microbiomes"
Environment," at the end of the two weeks. Right. I would think that there was probably a lot less hands in the dirt over the last two years, and, you know, all told like if you were to canvas the entire global population,"
No," you don't just show up and change your diet on day one, like to some degree you're still eating most of the same foods. And yeah, you're probably starting to integrate some of our stuff that we have, or perhaps going out to restaurants. But within like literally within three months"
No," of arriving in the United States, there already is a disturbance and a reduction of the gut microbiome in people who are immigrating to the United States. And even within the Hadza community, I mean, they're suffering encroachment on their native lands and there's a loss of, you know,"
No," and he's gone and lived with them for months at a time. Yeah. To, you know, basically refresh his soul. And he has amazing stories about that culture. That's really cool. What are we learning about long COVID. It's still early days"
No," in terms of understanding what that is, how long it'll last, what the, you know, long term repercussions are from that. But how are you thinking about this and understanding it and what kind of studies do we need to do to better understand it in general and also the role that the microbiome plays in it? Yeah."
No," So long COVID is the manifestation of symptoms that will carry on for months potentially after you've had COVID19, it's a very personal response. You can't really describe it as one particular symptom, it could be any of a number of different symptoms that people experience."
No," And there is actually a study that just came out in December, Rich, that showed that people who have long COVID have once again a disturbance of their gut microbiome. And when you drill down and you take a closer look at what's going on there, it starts to bring parallels"
No," to what we were seeing in the COVID19 study, where the gut microbiome of people with long COVID is once again, disturbed, and there is a loss of the shortchain fatty asset producing microbes. So we don't yet have a dietary intervention study or any sort of dietary study"
No," in association with the long COVID. But it is my expectation, like if I were to make a prediction, my prediction is that either in 2022 or early 23, we're gonna see a dietary study that's gonna tell us that fiber is protective from long COVID."
No," Yeah. It's really weird and disorienting, this whole thing, because some people get COVID, they recover very quickly, other people suffer very dire consequences. And it appears from a layperson's perspective that there is some level of randomness in terms of who's suffering from long COVID and who isn't."
No," Yeah. The microbiome is a community of these invisible microorganisms and there are several different varieties that are there, but they're there, they're covering every external surface that's a part of us as humans."
No," these microbes because we gave them tasks that we completely need them to do the job for us to be healthy humans. So starting with digestion, like digestion is access to nutrients. If we don't get access to nutrients, we don't live and we need them,"
No," we rely on them for the digestion of many of our foods. We've talked about our metabolism, our hormones, let me also inject, we talked about our immune system, our metabolism, let me also add our hormones and our mood, our brain health, our cognition, the expression of our genetic code. They are powerful and they're not even human."
No, of switches and you can turn them on or you can turn them off and whether or not you do that is going to determine what actually happens with our body. But the question is who's sitting at the switchboard and flipping the switches and the appearance is that these are the gut microbes.
No," And so this is actually something that I'm actively a part of right now, which is to take a look at personalized nutrition and the way in which we have different personal responses to the same intervention. You give two people the exact same diet, get two radically different results."
No," and the goal is weight loss. And this is just a hypothetical here, I'm not describing actual data, but let's pretend that it's plantbased versus keto. And in this study, the plantbased diet wins. All right. The average person consuming the plantbased diet"
No," loses four pounds. The average person consuming a ketogenic diet loses three pounds. And this is statistically significant. So we call, ""Oh, plantbased is better."" What do you say to the person who gained five pounds on a plantbased diet?"
No," What do you say to the person who lost 20 pounds on a ketogenic diet, different people have different responses to the exact same dietary intervention. Right. We are not the norm. All you have to do is go on Twitter to realize that's the case."
Environment," But I found also that it's easy to jump to conclusions that might not be correct in that stress, sleep, physical exercise, all of these things play into it. It's much more complicated than a very binary, like don't eat this food or do eat this food, but to introduce the microbiome"
No," a stool specimen that ultimately is going to be your microbiome test. In that kit you're also gonna receive some muffins. These muffins are standardized meals. That way we can compare, Rich Roll's results to Will Bulsiewicz's results. We're having the exact same meal"
No," So because adopting a plantbased diet transformed my life so profoundly, and because I want everybody to experience some version of what I've experienced, we decided to tackle and solve this very common problem. The solution we've devised, I'm proud to say is The Plantpower Meal Planner,"
No," transfer it to a germfree mouse and then they feed these two mice the exact same diet, the exact same number of calories, they eat all their food, and then you get different results in terms of their body habitus, one becomes obese, the other becomes skinny"
No," enough in the obesity space is satiety. Like actually feeling full when you eat a meal, because we eat a diet, that's like a fast food junk food diet, devoid of fiber. And as a result of that, we actually have studies from Kevin Hall at the NIH where on this type of like ultra process diet"
No," like trigger to the brain, right? To stop eating. What is the relationship between that signal and the nutritional value of the food you eat? Like what is impacting like whether you feel full or not, 'cause it's not just the distension of your stomach, right? Yeah, there is a number of different hormones"
No," we were talking more generally about studying people who eat lowcarb or plantbased and average weight loss numbers, but there is the outlier, the person who goes on the plantbased diet, and instead of losing the average five pounds, ends up gaining 10 pounds or whatever it is, that brings us back to this topic"
No," So like clearly the foods that you choose are a factor in terms of your blood glucose response. And your microbiome is a part of that too. How much is the microbiome represented relative to your diet? Well, what we found in our study is that the diet is more powerfully represented"
No," Yeah, and it's And blood pressure and nutrient absorption and you know, everything else. And potentially our immune system and potentially your mood, and so you could go down the line and all, you know, and your digestion Wow."
No," And access to nutrients. So this is a powerful thing, and I think what's exciting about it, and what creates hope for people is that you are not cursed with the microbiome that you were born with. You have the ability to shape and change that microbiome"
No," Obviously we can just adopt a high fiber diet, but what are the other things that we should be doing to, you know, make this as permanent as possible? Well, permanent results come from consistency. Yeah. Persistent habits, right."
No," And being sustained, yes, exactly. So that like one week cleanse or that 30 day fat diet, they're not really helping you. So at the end of the day what you want is you want small changes that you repeat every single day, moving in the right direction,"
No," things like that. I personally have friends that suffer from this terribly and have tried all manner of microbiome related protocols to repair their gut lining, et cetera, with pretty mixed results. Yeah. So, you know, because I'm sure"
No," there's a lot of people listening or watching to this, who have some version of that, that they're dealing with right now, Yeah. And are perhaps frustrated by doing this, you know, battery of probiotics or adopting a really high fat diet and then adopting a really high fiber diet"
No," there is a genetic predisposition. It would be unfair to pretend that this is just exclusively a dietary thing. And I don't think they should carry that burden of guilt in any way, because like, you didn't do anything wrong. We're all eating junk food."
No," To say that there's a cure is not accurate. There is remission. Remission basically means that your disease is not active. And if you have a permanent remission that is as close to a cure as we can ever get. So how do we accomplish that? Well, to me, this is not exclusively diet in lifestyle,"
No," and this is not exclusively medications, and any approach that ignores the other side is not taking advantage of the opportunities that we have to make a person better. So what we need is we need to bring the best of diet and lifestyle into these patients in a sustained way that develops healthy habits."
No," And at the same time, like if a person has Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and they're in my clinic and they're actively flaring, let me be perfectly honest with you, Rich, I'm not worried about their diet in that moment. Because when the forest is burning,"
No," We have to plant the trees and we have to allow them to mature with the right fertile conditions in order for the forest to grow back. So to be more specific with these particular conditions like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, I will change their diet, I will change their lifestyle,"
No," using the exact same tools in many ways, to figuring out how to help these people. Let's shift focus. I wanna talk a little bit about the brain gut connection and in particular the relationship between mental health and the microbiome. Yeah."
No," These things are not separate. They're integrated. Our gut, it's best friend is the brain, our brain's best friend is the gut. And they are in constant communication with one another talking literally right now. There is a number of different ways"
No," Serotonin is the happy hormone. It makes us feel vibrant with energy, it makes us feel uplifted in terms of mood. That's not mostly produced in the brain, that's mostly produced in the gut. Because in the gut, it's actually involved in our motility and our rhythm,"
No," that will then travel through the bloodstream approach, the blood brain barrier, and potentially affect the blood brain barrier, or even cross the blood brain barrier into the brain and affect mood, cognition or memory. It's so insane. It's crazy."
No," Rich, you are a super organism. You are a super organism. You are not Rich Roll functioning in isolation. You have this entire community of living creatures, and yes they're invisible, but they are there. And they are a part of what makes you who you are. And that includes potentially the cravings"
No," that you have for food, that includes your mood or how you think or your memory, and so it's just quite fascinating to imagine that they can be that powerful. But I don't think that they're powerful to the point that like I'm just a zombie walking around being controlled by my gut microbes."
No," when you do a fecal transplant of a mouse that really likes chocolate and put into another one that is indifferent, or maybe they've done this in humans, I think. Those cravings shift, which is bananas. Yep. And it's interesting in thinking"
No," and they may be sending signaling molecules that are basically motivating you to go and do this. And does it not follow then if you shift your diet and start eating healthy foods, let's say suddenly you've never eaten kale and broccoli and spinach and stuff like that, and suddenly you start eating that over time,"
No," and are commandeered by cravings for these healthier foods. What happened with you when you changed your diet. Yeah, it did, and I talk about it all the time. People don't believe me or think you're like a lunatic or something like that. You are a bit of a lunatic, but. But I'm telling you that it is true, right?"
No," that my taste buds had completely changed. Yeah. And you know, it's kind of interesting that, just another anecdotal piece of evidence, 'cause I sincerely believe that this is the truth. And I've seen this a bazillion times where people shift their diet"
No," You gotta stay in it. And so I'm convinced that what mom eats during pregnancy ultimately determines the taste buds of the child during, like when they're an infant. And the way that I know this is if anyone has had broccoli sprouts, I mean, look, I'm a huge fan for their health benefits,"
No," And I embrace the bitter because that is the phytochemical, the sulforaphane that's fighting cancer inside my body. But like how do you take a seven month old child and put broccoli sprouts on a tray and they smash them. How do you explain that? And this was not a one time event. This was every single day."
No, and he was smashing them. And all I can say is I'm pretty sure that mom's diet ultimately parlays into the child's microbiome and their dietary preferences. Yeah. Super interesting. Back to this idea of the gut brain connection. What is the science saying about like people
No," who suffer from some level of mood disorder or depression? Like is there any interesting research coming out about how treating the microbiome can produce positive results? Not in the way that we have with the cancer research and I think part of that is the investment of money into cancer research that's out there,"
No," So I'm talking about things like depression. And so we have these dietary interventions, but at the same time more recently we have microbiome data. So we can see actually in the microbes a specific pattern that exists among people that have mood disorders. This is true of both anxiety and also major depression."
No," with poor health outcomes, and simultaneously we see in these people that suffer for example, with major depression, with less of the antiinflammatory shortchain fatty acid producing microbes. So part of the theory or idea behind this and like why is the fiber intervention valuable"
No, to a person with a mood disorder? The fiber intervention is valuable because it can change the microbiome and it can also lead to the production of more shortchain fatty acids. And we believe that the antiinflammatory nature is helping to combat the inflammation of depression.
No, Depression is an inflammatory disorder. That's super interesting. Now I've never heard anybody say depression is an inflammatory disorder. It's a hundred percent is. And
No," Inflammation is the way that we heal from an injury. Inflammation is supposed to be our friend, but you fast forward to 2022, and our modern lifestyle is basically activating these inflammatory mechanisms in a chronic smoldering way. So it's not the big burst of inflammation"
No," That includes cancer, and I'm here telling you, and I don't think this is a big shock, but that includes mood disorder, Wow. Like anxiety and depression. Wow. So now Rich, what we don't have is..."
No," they have the app and they can enter into the app how they're feeling on a daily basis, so they can enter in their energy levels. And it's done on what we call a visual analog scale, where you basically slide a bar from zero to 100. Now this visual analog scale is actually a validated measure,"
No," meaning that it's been proven through research to be valid and consistently useful for clinical research when it comes to anxiety. So people enter into the app, whether or not they're feeling anxious, and we can measure this for 14 days and now using the ZOE data,"
No," where that data set would be supplemented with the data that you would get from, say, WHOOP, that's tracking heart rate variability, sleep states, respiratory rate, et cetera, skin temperature,, to be a more accurate predictor rather than just consumer reporting,"
No," in the release of the commercial product was a clinical trial called PREDICT 1. And in the PREDICT 1: trial, we actually, Matthew Walker actually has been working with us. Oh cool. And so he's the sleep expert Right."
No, For those who don't know. And we actually published a sleep study very recently looking at our data because we actually did collect that. We had people wearing the accelerometer and collecting the sleep data so that we could actually do those types of analyses.
No," that the quality and duration of my sleep had a major impact on my body's ability to stabilize blood sugar, and I don't know like what's causing what, but there is definitely a relationship and an interplay there. There is an explanation for that."
No," Do microbes go to sleep? The microbes have a circadian rhythm too, because what happened is that once life came to earth, you know, 4.5 billion years ago, the first life we believe were the akia. which are some of the microbes. And these akia actually may be inside our colon right now."
No," Like dinosaurs from 4.5 billion years ago are a part of the human gut microbiome. There is one evolutionary fact that was true of every single form of life on this planet, regardless of where you lived or what your diet was or anything else, the sun rose in the morning and it fell at night."
No," and the most impactful is what we're putting in our mouth, right? So let's get really specific on food. We've talked enough about fiber, but when we're thinking about high fiber foods, what should we be thinking about? And what types of foods are you suggesting"
No," that we build into our diet? Because one of the things just to underscore this, that is a mantra for you is that, you know, moving towards this sort of microbiome promoting lifestyle and diet is not about, you know, reducing things or removing things from your diet, it's about building more abundance into it."
No," the American Gut Project, this goes beyond any sort of theory or idea on gut health. There Is a reason why the major gut health scientists of our time are stepping forward and talking about the importance of diversity in the diet. And that's because in the American Gut Project where they had 11,000 people"
No," and literally people from across the globe and they were analyzing their diet and lifestyle and comparing it to the health of their gut microbiome, they found that there was a single most powerful predictor of a healthy gut, which was the diversity of plants in their diet. Specifically in that study,"
No," is make this a central dietary philosophy, And if you do this, like you don't need to count grams of fiber or macros or calories, You count plants. How many varieties of plants can you get into your diet? So to do this, I created a game, it's called Plant Points."
No," Where like, basically we sit down at a meal and it could be like, me, you, my family, your family, and let's see who can get the most plant points. Right? And we're gonna see how many plants each one of us can get, every single plant counts. And you wanna get as many different varieties"
No," and thinking about macros, et cetera, it's just eat the largest diversity of plants as possible. And if you take away one thing from this podcast and begin to implement that into your life, I think that can have the biggest impact and it's something that you can just grok super easily. Like, okay, how many plants have I eaten today?"
No," Here is where I'll go with that. So let's go beyond just the power of plants and let's dig into some of the research being done by Justin Sonnenburg at Stanford University in conjunction with my friend, from the ZOE scientific advisory board, Christopher Gardner, and basically what they did,"
No," And it was published in the summer, I believe July of 2021> Is they were looking at different dietary patterns, different ways that they could intervene in a person's diet and ultimately what effect that has on the gut microbiome. And in their study they introduced people to fermented foods."
No," Now fermented foods are traditional foods. Every culture in human history has included fermented foods as a centerpiece of their diet. Right. Funny how that works, right? This evolutionary adaptation that becomes central to a culture,"
No," to consume these fermented foods because we were seduced by our canning and processing and preservatives, and we went towards that type of food. Now that's 60% of the American diet and it's time for us to swing the pendulum back towards a more traditional based diet. And in this study, Justin Sonnenburg"
No," the fermented foods into your diet. I think that's an important part of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But at the same time eating sauerkraut or kimchi once in a while, while also eating a predominantly Western industrialized diet,"
No," and everybody should check out... Justin Sonnenburg did a recent podcast with Andrew Huberman, that's great. He's also along with his wife has been on our friend Simon Hill's Plant Proof Podcast. Yeah, and he supported my book, you can see the quote Right."
No," or you can be putting more stuff on the side that takes that health away, that disturbs the gut microbiome. And so now look at the average Americans diet right now, and what we see is that their diet is 10% plants, it's devoid of these fermented foods. It's 60% ultra processed foods,"
No," It's impossible for me to believe that preservatives designed to destroy microbes are good for the gut microbiome. That's impossible. Right. And then the last 30% of our diet is animal products, meat, dairy, and eggs. Now I can tell you what the fiber content"
No," I'm like, that is such a small amount of polyphenols relative to you eating one leaf of kale, right? But the reason that there's polyphenols in that grass fed meat is because the cow was eating grass. And then you slaughter the cow and whatever's in its blood you're gonna get some of that. So that may include polyphenols,"
No," but if the cow was pumped up with antibiotics, it's gonna be that too, right? What's amazing about all of this is the science is abundantly clear that eating a diversity of plant foods on your diet is key. We can talk about fermented foods, et cetera, but in order to function optimally,"
No," we need to be focused on fiber. Yep. And so many people are walking around worried about being protein deficient. We talked about this last time, we should be thinking about, you know, our fiber intake and that ends up taking"
No," or relative certainty, we have the rise of the carnivore diet. Yep. And this is sort of caught fire on social media. Yep. Yep. Lots of people are cottoning onto this, there are certain influencers who are promoting this"
No," it's impossible for me to wrap my head around why adopting a carnivore diet would be a good idea. And yet here we are, and this is what we're seeing. I'm certain that you've thought about this. So please, you know, share with me your perspective. Well, so first of all, if we're talking about the scale of balance, you know,"
No," I'm proposing that where I want people ultimately to be is a predominantly plantbased diet in terms of their calories. And that is 70, 80, 90 or a hundred percent plantbased. Rich, there are many forms of a healthy diet. It's not just only a plant exclusive diet. A plant exclusive diet is when you align your desire"
Environment," for your best health with also ethical concerns about the environment and the animals. But that's not the only healthy diet, there is no denying the Mediterranean diet. So the point from my perspective is that there are many forms of a healthy diet, but they are all plant predominant diets,"
No," what we do know about science and say, ""Well, what do we think is going to happen?"" Now I have told you that single greatest predictor of a healthy gut microbiome is the diversity of plants in our diet. I've talked about how a lowcarb diet was disadvantageous when it comes to COVID19,"
No," I've talked about how fiber actually saved people's lives in melanoma when they were receiving immunotherapy. And we are talking about a carnivore diet that is zero grams of fiber, zero grams of fiber. It's impossible. The diversity of plants,"
No," like I don't even need to test you. 'Cause I already know, it's zero. It's impossible for me to believe that in the long run this is good for the gut microbiome, but there is a bit of a challenge that exists, which is that many of these people will claim that they healed their gut by going on a carnivore diet."
No," I think that there is value to removing ultra processed foods. Sure. And the carnivore diet, one of the things that it does really well is that it gives people a framework in order to actually accomplish that."
No," And when people do see improvements of their autoimmune disease, and I am not saying that there, like there are people who do this diet and they say that it improves their autoimmune disease. I attribute that to the fact that you have removed ultra processed foods from your diet. That's what I think you've done."
No," So, but the problem is, Rich, that you withdraw these foods, right? And you say, ""Well, my gut is healed."" Your gut is not healed because you have the absence of discomfort. Your gut is healed when you're able to actually tolerate those foods"
No," and a person who withdraws these foods on a carnivore diet, if they reintroduce these foods, their food intolerances are even worse than when they started. And so you're not actually healing the gut. If anything I believe that you're making your gut health worse in the process of doing this."
No," after you eat the piece of fruit, right? So this is what happens in this particular case. They say, ""Oh, well I cured my diabetes."" No, 'cause you're not capable of eating normal food without your blood sugar going off the charts because your diet has made you insulin resistant. Right."
No," and you step funny on a route of a tree and you twist your knee, right? And it's like, okay, so Rich, you could stop walking permanently and you will never feel pain in your knee, but your legs atrophy, and now you're sedentary and your metabolism gets outta whack and you gain weight"
No," and the solution is to heal the knee, to restore function. And that's working through a process like perhaps with a physical therapist, where you work through this process with this physical therapist restoring function to the knee. And yes, there may be some discomfort in that process. But when you emerge on the other side,"
No," it's making you weaker, but because you're avoiding it, you can pretend that you have fixed your blood glucose level because it comes down. I think the last thing I wanna say real quick about this is that because, about the carnivore diet, is that because the consumption of saturated is so high, saturated fat drives up LDL cholesterol."
No," LDL Cholesterol is a widely accepted risk factor for coronary artery disease. This goes beyond epidemiology studies where we say, ""Oh, a person with higher cholesterol, LDL cholesterol has higher risk of coronary artery disease. Yes, that is true. But then we have multiple different drug interventions"
No, of different classes that work in different ways to lower LDL cholesterol and in these clinical trials people are less likely to have a heart attack and die of heart disease. Any person who promotes a carnivore diet and tells you that the LDL cholesterol
No," and tell you that that's okay. You don't have to convince me, you know. It would be interesting to do a long term study on the microbiome of people who have persisted on a current carnivore diet. Yeah, or a keto diet. We'd see with that. Yeah, exactly."
No," I would be very interested to see it. Yeah. Like I'm very open to these things. I'm not here to attack people or be a zealot about this. Like again, I'm here to tell people that there are many different forms of a healthy diet, but based upon everything that I've seen,"
No," these are plant predominant diets. And so I think that all of us, if you are 10% plantbased, that is more than I was and you just take it one day, one meal at a time, moving in this direction and don't put much pressure on yourself. Yeah."
No," to diet is becoming in certain circles that have been traditionally resistant to this idea. And by that I mean the kind of biohacking or longevity interested or obsessed space, which has typically been populated with people who are more interested in a low carb approach or a keto approach,"
No," 'cause that's more of a biohacking lens on health. But you know, for example, I mentioned Justin Sonnenburg recently being on Andrew Huberman and he was very clear. Like if you wanna, you know, basically take an insurance policy out on longevity and you want your metabolism to operate optimally being as plant predominant as possible is key."
No," that has Silicon Valley, you know, very focused on this, and to the extent that a plant predominant diet is contributing to this, you know, idea of human health span extension, I find to be super interesting. We both know to Tom Bilyeu, you, I recently was over at his house, I did his show again,"
No," Yeah. Are now thinking about it and practicing it in a way that even I don't think I would've predicted. Yeah. Well I think that... So first of all, I think that makes me respect"
No," A food allergy involves the activation of the immune system. Your immune system has decided that this food is the enemy. Any allergy, I mean, literally the definition of the word allergy is the activation of the immune system in response to some sort of outside stimulus. So like asthma is an allergy in our lungs."
No, Why so much peanut allergy out there? They're very common. And actually there's interesting research looking at development of the infant microbiome and the belief that food allergies in children come from disturbances of the gut microbiome Wow. In these children.
No," So anyway, and a food allergy is the activation of the immune system and it may manifest in a number of different ways, that could include GI symptoms. Like it could include bloating, gas, pain, diarrhea, or constipation, but classically we're gonna see other stuff."
No," the difference, but food intolerances are always manifested with symptoms. You don't have a food intolerance and be symptom free. Usually they're digestive symptoms. So gas, bloating, abdominal discomfort, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, and by definition, a food intolerance does not involve activation"
No," So it is not inflammation. It is generally sloppy digestion. Your gut microbiome, which we talked about in the very beginning of the show is critical to our digestive process, is struggling to keep up with the demands of the diet that you're consuming,"
No," So now growth is a very big word in my community because I talked about in ""Fiber Fields"" the growth mindset, which came from Carol Dweck, she wrote a book about it. Right. And so the growth mindset is about ignoring, like winning versus losing, and instead is about valuing the challenge"
No," with my patients to identify and ultimately heal them. So the first step is G, G stands for Genesis. What is the root of our problem? So as a medical doctor the first question is, what am I treating? Because if I start delivering treatments and I don't even know what I'm treating,"
No," this is what I'm thinking about. These three things, because if they are there I can fix them, and when I fix them most of the time the food intolerances go away entirely, and you save yourself from having to go through any sort of process 'cause you're done."
Environment," And the way that we do this is the same way that we exercise. Our body is adaptable. Like you become a runner in your forties and you progressively ratchet up the distances that you run, your legs grow stronger, you become more efficient with oxygen,"
Environment," your heart chambers grow larger. It actually is able to more efficiently squeeze blood, so it can slow down and your lungs actually expand and you're able to mobilize more oxygen. Yeah. You're not exercise intolerant, you're just exercise maladapted."
Environment," Right. If you're outta shape. Exactly. Yeah. And so when we go through that process of introducing exercise, there is a process that we all familiar with, that we go through to basically build up that strength"
No," or build up that endurance that we're looking for. You can apply the exact same approach to your gut. These microbes can be trained when you don't use them, you lose them. They grow weaker, they atrophy. That's what restrictive diets do. But on the flip side when we take the foods"
Environment," that we struggle with and we go low and we introduce them slowly, increasing time, then that is conceptually the same as the person who is training for the marathon and starting off with a short run or the person who's going to the gym and wants to be ripped, but they're starting off with the five pound dumbbells."
No," and maybe had a terrible diet beforehand and just says like, I'm just bloated all the time, is terrible, I can't do this. You know, if you eat beans or whatever, and I always just say, ""Well, just stick with it. ""Eventually your gut will adapt. You know, I'm just like, ""Suck it up and do it."""
No," they're just a window into kind of where you're at now, and that is something that can shift. If you take advantage of this kind of growth protocol that you're talking about. Your gut has strengths and weaknesses, and every single one of us has a certain threshold at which it is becoming excessive"
No," you need to try a low histamine diet and see if it improves. And by simply doing this for two weeks it could potentially change your life. And what would be an example of foods that would find their way onto a low histamine diet? Well, let me describe the foods"
No," than many people perhaps even realize, because I'm not just talking about sauerkraut and kimchi here, I'm also referring to things like vinegar and chocolate and alcohol. So all of these things are high in histamine, many different animal products are high in histamine."
No," it could be flushing, runny nose, headache, rapid heart rate, lightheadedness. So many of these are nonspecific symptoms that you wouldn't necessarily Right. Equate to a food intolerance. What about puffiness in your face or under your eyes?"
No," it because a doctor is never going to turn to you and hand you a packet full of recipes. The way that we have to diagnose histamine intolerance is with food. You have to eat a low histamine diet for two weeks. Now that's an overwhelming and complicated thing if you don't have someone guiding you and holding your hand,"
No," you have to do a low histamine diet first and so we give you 25 recipes that you can follow as a protocol, and you just basically quite simply cook the food that I give you for two weeks and see how you feel. And if you feel better, then we have we're on to something. But then this growth protocol"
Environment," because of the histamine that's in their food. So we're going to heal that part. So resolve the dysbiosis with nonhistamine plant foods. That's part one. But the second part is that there is a process to training your gut and reintroducing these foods,"
No," and when I eat food, like, when I eat fermented food I don't feel well and I can get like hives or a little bit of a rash or flushing or a runny nose or a headache. And that person should be doing this low histamine protocol to identify whether or not they have histamine intolerance. Right. Yeah."
No," I would suspect this is gonna be news for a lot of people and they're gonna try it and be like, ""Oh my God, like this was right underneath ""me the whole time and I didn't realize."" I pray that that's the case. Yeah. Yeah. Because that to me is,"
Environment," If I throw you into an abnormal heart rhythm, I could literally make it so you can't even walk up a flight of stairs, right? Despite the fact that you're training for a marathon and the same is true with our gut, our gut thrives on rhythm and rhythm means that we are having good, regular, complete,"
No," this is not what they experience. It's not in rhythm. They struggle with it. It doesn't come regularly. They fear bowel movements because they have to strain just to have like a little nugget, right? These are people who are out of rhythm and ultimately they manifest symptoms as a result of that."
No," There are people who have diarrhea that are actually constipated and it's kind of mind blowing, but what's happening there is that we're missing the second part of the story, which is really critical, which is do you have a complete evacuation? So when you go, do you feel like you're really completely going?"
No," Well, but the problem is there's a lot of people out there that aren't experiencing that. And you know, the last thing that I want people to hear about because I really hope that there are people who benefit from this. Is that there is a group of people"
No," that have what is called overflow diarrhea. And these are people who chronically suffer with constipation. And one day the poop gets impacted and you have a column of solid stool that is not moving and the only thing that can get through, sneaking through the cracks and the crevices,"
No, Is the liquid. Is the liquid. Yeah. And it comes down to the bottom and our bottom is not designed to stop liquid from coming out. And so you get urgency and you rush to the restroom and it explodes out as diarrhea.
No," And you go into your doctor and you say, ""I'm having diarrhea."" And they say, ""Take Imodium."" And Imodium slows down your motility even more, and your problem gets worse. Makes it worse. Yeah. The paradoxical solution in this particular case,"
No," with a person who has this overflow diarrhea, the paradoxical solution is to flush it out. You gotta get it out and then start over. I wanna get to colon cleanses in a second. I want to touch on that. But first I'm gonna take advantage of the fact that you're here."
No," Like, I think I'm on the opposite end of this spectrum because I do a number two, like six times a day and I'm thinking this can't be, like it's so much more often or frequent than most people that I know. And Julie, my wife is like, ""Yeah, but you're like a furnace,"
No," I feel fine. Yeah. You know. So from my perspective, a guy who Is consuming a super high fiber diet, we know that, right? We know you're consuming a high fiber diet and you're a runner and that actually stimulates motility,"
No," Our sedentary lifestyle is part of what's contributing to the epidemic constipation that we see out there these days. Constipation is far more common of a problem than diarrhea is. But when you move your intestines move, people who run quite frequently"
No," will have more frequent bowel movements because they're a runner. So you take a gentleman, yourself, who is on a high fiber diet, a high fiber diet by itself. You are not a runner, Rich, if you were a sedentary man, you would still probably be having three"
No," That you want in there. Right. But would that be a scenario in which maybe that would be a good idea for that person or would you just amp up their fiber until the motility enhances and it all gets cleaned out? Well, I think you're bringing up a very important point that I'm glad that we get to bring"
Environment," So in people who have mild constipation, meaning not every day and not going on for days at a time, but instead like a touch and go, here and there, maybe twice a month, right? In that person, you turn up the fiber, you increase your water consumption, you get some exercise, maybe you literally take a walk after dinner"
No," so that they can react and respond Right. To what they experience in terms of their symptoms. So when fiber is moving through, fiber is your friends, but when fiber gets locked up, it turns into cement and your gut microbes are given unlimited access to ferment that fiber"
No," We're back in business. You're good. Right now fiber is your friend again. But if you are staying locked up and you're not getting it moving through, that's a problem. And you're gonna have worsening of your gas and bloating. And I've had a number of people"
No," who come to see me and they're like, ""Doc, I was inspired by your book. ""I started doing your fourweek plan. ""and I felt like crap."" ""Really? What symptoms?"" ""Gas, bloating, little bit of nausea, tons of fatigue."" I'm describing constipation right now."
No," This is what people feel like. And I know instantly your issue is constipation and it goes back to the very beginning of the growth strategy. Fatigue goes hand in hand Oh, big time. With constipation. A hundred percent. A hundred percent."
No," the food intolerances go away, you introduce the fiber now, after you've already got things moving through. Now you introduce the fiber and the fiber is rolling through and the fiber stays your friend. But how do you fix the constipation? Well, there is a number of ways."
No," Well, I don't want you to take medication either if I can avoid it. So what I will do is I will use magnesium and magnesium is a beautiful thing because it can be taken before bedtime, helps with sleep, helps with mood, reduces headaches, and by the way, it's great for bowel movements."
No," before we start is too low, my patient is missing magnesium. Our diet is deficient, and when I supplement them and they start pooping and they're getting these health benefits, I repeat their magnesium level and all of a sudden I discover it's like exactly where it needs to be."
No," like this is like placebo controlled trials showing that this works, Wow. As well as many drugs for constipation. So I think it's a great approach that people can start with. And then, you know, there is other things downstream, like again permutations of possibilities"
No," We talked about plant diversity, we talked about, you know, 30, you know, trying to get, you know, 30 different varietals of plants in our diet every day. We talked about fermentation, bowel movements, et cetera. What are some other, you know, just kind of really practical actionable things that think that people"
No," should be thinking about and practicing to enhance the, you know, the health of their gut. We wanna move the scale of balance. We wanna move the scale of balance and start to put the weight on the side of healthy foods. And so yes, this does involve eating more plants in variety, in abundance,"
Environment," that was published from people from the University of Nottingham, where we did a exercise intervention and it was literally 15 minutes of exercise, that's it? And we did not change people's diets. And in doing this, 15 minutes of exercise, like who can't do that, come on, you can do that."
Environment," In doing the 15 minute exercise intervention, we saw a shift in their gut microbiome and the results was that we had more butyrate producing microbes. So going full circle all the way back to the beginning, we were talking about like in COVID19, severe COVID19, the absence of butyrate producing microbes"
Environment," in people that have severe disease. Like there are so many examples where this is good for us, and what I'm saying to you is, yes, dietary fiber will increase the representation of butyrate producing microbes, but so will exercise. What is the mechanism for that?"
Environment," our perception of pain. So in this study that we did, it was people who had arthritis and when people do exercise and they have arthritis, they have improvement of their pain because we're activating the endocannabinoid system. But it turns out that the endocannabinoid system"
No," So like where is the runners high? Where does it come from? And we believe that this actually comes from the endocannabinoid system. So yeah. So it's quite fascinating to consider this and it's like you're not even changing your diet,"
Environment," but yet when you do consume fiber, you will get more short chain fatty acid from that fiber because of the exercise. So basically what I'm saying is we're synergizing. With just a 15 minute minimum dose. That was a 15 minute minimum dose. Now of course, like we wanna strive"
No," to do even more than that if we can. I mean, as humans we were not designed to only do 15 minutes of movement per day, right? But in this study just 15 minutes made a difference for these people. Yeah. So sleep becomes very important."
No," We know that people who get more sleep, more restful sleep, have more diversity within their gut microbiome. If you wake up in the middle of the night at four in the morning, and like you're having those racing thoughts, this phenomenon of waking up in the middle of the night has been associated with decreased microbial diversity."
No," So sleep is something, the people that we surround ourselves with. Very interesting study, Rich, where they looked at spouses and they discovered that you share more microbes with your spouse than you do with your siblings who share your genetic code, right?"
No," And come from the same place. And what was really interesting about this is that they showed that it was not their diet. That was the explanation. There was something else going on. But here is my favorite part, in this study the amount of love and affinity"
No," that you had for your spouse was associated with the beneficial response that you received. So the person who felt most connected to their spouse actually shared the most microbes with their spouse. Wow. Now I don't know if that's kissing,"
No," touching, if that's like sex, but at the end of the day, the people who felt closest to their spouse were sharing the most microbes, the people who felt most distant from their spouse were not. That's super interesting. That's super interesting."
Environment," about when we're talking about, you know, weight loss, longevity, it doesn't matter. Right? Get a good night sleep, increase the amount of plant foods that you're eating, get outside and exercise, connect with nature, connect with other human beings, all of these things."
Environment," and they never get anywhere. And they will come in and they will say, ""Dr. B, I have done everything that you have asked me to do. ""I eat a diversity a of plants, ""I sleep, I exercise,"" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The issue is that these people oftentimes have something in their subconscious"
No," She has ulcerative colitis and I was pulling out all my tricks. So I mean, I had her on what I thought was the right medicine, I was working on her diet, lifestyle, all these different things. It was not working."
Environment," And she says to me, ""Well, I finally had the audacity to change my job."" She was working in an environment where she dreaded going to work on a daily basis, where her boss would publicly belittle her in front of her work colleagues. It was a hostile environment."
Environment," And she ultimately decided that she needed a change. She left, she entered into a new work environment where people treat her with respect and just this simple shift completely fixed her health issues. Incredible and beautiful."
No," And more will be revealed. Like we're just at the start of this amazing adventure into the microbiome. Revolution. I think, you know what? We're gonna be learning and discovering over the next five to 10 years,"
No," it's gonna blow people's minds. Absolutely. And you're right there, man, on the cutting edge of it, doing the thing. Thank you. That was amazing. I think people are gonna get a lot of value"
No," out of what we just talked about and I appreciate you sharing so openly over the course of these past couple of hours, and you are doing fantastic work. I'm at your service, my friend. So everybody who is listening and watching, if you have not yet checked out Dr. B's first book,"
No," I love it. That's fantastic. Our friend Simon Hill did that for the episodes that he did on the show and the audience loved it. So that's very generous of you to do. And of course, I'll link all that up in the show notes if you can't remember the website or any of that stuff."
No," In the meantime, pick up Will's new book, the ""Fiber Fueled Cookbook"", available everywhere, and you can find out more information about it on his website, theplantfedgut.com. And there are so many more, I made this outline, I shared it with you, and there were all these other topics"
No," you know that this was a dream come true for me to be a part of this and to be here with you today for the first time in person is really, it's just crazy for me. Well, the pleasure and the honor is all mine and we'll see you back here soon, my friend. Thank you, man."
Environment," Hi , I 'm Nazarene vintage in ID . This is environmental health lecture . Your help depends on the environment around you . Environmental health is the study of how the environment affects human health . It differs from the study of how humans affect the environment because it"
Environment, focuses on people 's health and environmental scientists might study how water pollution is hurting fish in environmental health . Scientists would study what happens to the health of people when they catch and eat those fish . Environmental health is not just

Environment," the environment to see if they might be dangerous to humans , they are trying to understand the toxic city of those chemicals . Toxicity is a measure of how dangerous a chemical is , the greater a chemicals toxicity , the less it takes to make a person sick or even kill them . The"

Environment," environmental justice . What is environmental justice ? Everyone has the right to live in an environment that does n't make them sick , regardless of their race , culture or income . This is called environmental justice . The EJ process , unfortunately , some neighborhoods"
No," or communities , are exposed to more environmental hazards than others and may suffer higher rates of health problems . These communities often have less economic or political power in society when decisions are made , for example , toxic"
Environment," waste dumps , polluting factories and busy highways are often built in lower income . Neighborhoods or communities of color communities recognize this as an environmental health issue and work to seek environmental justice , community resources and action . Where can you go in"
No," your own community to collect information about an environmental health issue ? You can learn more about specific issues , understand environmental laws or seek environmental justice by using community resources . Community resources include places like the"

Environment," are concerned about air pollution , for example , you might decide to walk to school instead of getting a ride in a car . Next , ask yourself how you can share what you have learned with others so that they can help too . Maybe you could write a letter"
No," to the editor of your local newspaper or speak to your community council or school board ? Maybe you could create a flyer to handout in your neighborhood . There are many great ways to get the word out and make positive changes in the world , use your imagination and be"
Environment," Hello , all my name is Zohir Chowdhury and we will begin with the definition of environmental health . We will learn what environmental health is by going over definitions from some wellknown agencies in the united states and around the world . First of all , how does the world health organization , or who define environmental health according to who environmental health comprises those aspects of human health , including quality of life that are determined by physical , chemical , biological , social and psychosocial factors in the environment ? It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing correcting , controlling and preventing those factors in the environment"
Environment," that can potentially affect adversely the health of present and future generations . Please note in here the terms : physical , chemical , biological , social and psychosocial factors in the environment . These specific terms are recurring and you will see them in various definitions that we 'll go over today : clean air , stable climate , adequate water , sanitation and hygiene , safe use of chemicals , protection from radiation , healthy and safe workplaces , sound agricultural practices , health supporting cities and built environments are all Prerequisite for good health , healthy environments could prevent almost one quarter of the global burden of disease according"
Environment," and uh , adding on to these definitions , the european charter on environment and health states that environmental health includes both the direct pathological effects of chemical radiation and some biological agents and the facts often interact on health and wellbeing of the broad physical , Psychological , social and aesthetic environment , which includes housing , urban development , land use and transport . Here you can again see those specific factors : chemical , radiation , biological , the same time where these factors are affecting humans . So , by going over all of these definitions , we can realize the major specific fields and subfields"
Environment," where environmental health professionals operate . The impact of mankind continuously threatens the quality of our air water , land and food supply within the discipline of environmental health . Major fields are food safety factor , control , air water quality , as well as climate change , hazardous and solid waste , radiation safety and environmental justice and law , to name a few . We said this . We also have other fields such as occupational and industrial hygiene , environmental toxicology , for example , so to briefly go over some of these fields . So you are aware of what the main responsibilities are within these fields : let 's go over them , so food safety deals with the"
Environment," Enforcement of health and safety standards in the handling of food preparation for the public . It also educates food operators on proper food preparation and service vector control , on the other hand , deals with enforcement of various public health laws , sanitary codes and other regulations related to spread of disease by factors such as mosquitoborne diseases , as well as other zoonotic diseases , air and Water quality , climate change , focus on monitoring and enforcing government regulations for protecting the air , water and preventing climate change . The potential threat to human health posed by chemic by contaminated air , water and changing"
Environment," climate can not be underestimated . It 'S so important , hazardous and solid waste . On the other hand , focus on overseeing household waste collection and disposal , since improper disposal of household hazardous waste can pollute the environment and pose a threat to human health . Radiation safety focuses on safe usage of radiation and radioactive materials , as well as regulatory compliance and finally , environmental justice and law focus on provide providing input to government agencies assisting in the formulation of environmental policies and may be involved in litigation concerning environmental health problems as well . So hopefully , by going over these definitions and"
No," you , such as your passport or driving license . You can bring someone such as a carer support worker friend or family member with you to support you and they can take part in the discussion too . If you would find this useful , if you have an appointee , a person who has the legal"
No," driving is quite simple and doesn't require many modifications. The first step to driving is learning what type of adaptations you may need. Just because you use a wheel chair That does not mean you must buy an accessible van with a ramp or lift. In fact, most individuals with the majority of hand and arm function"
Environment, can buy any type of vehicle right off of the lot. If you are new to adaptive driving or are unsure what type of accommodations you may need Then you will need to meet with a physical or occupational therapist or a certified driver rehabilitation specialist. Contact your state's department of vocational or rehabilitation services To learn about the steps it takes to receive a driver's license.
No," For motorcycle hand controls, you will twist your hand control to accelerate and press it forward to stop. I would encourage you to try the different options and figure out what works best for you. Talk to your mobility equipment dealer about the different types of hand controls they offer and ask if you can try before you buy. Step 3."
No," Once you have picked your hand controls or other adaptive devices it's time to think about your vehicle. finding the right vehicle is just like finding the right wheel chair. It's a balance of form and function. Sure, you want your vehicle to have a certain appearance. But, you also want it to be practical."
Environment, Another step to consider when transferring into a tall vehicle is applying your seatbelt before you disassemble your chair. This will give you a little extra security when bending down over very hard pavement. Just like the many different methods to put your chair into your vehicle there are even more ways to transfer yourself into your vehicle. I always look for a vehicle
No, then you can complete the final step of the adaptive driving process. Take your vehicle to a mobility equipment or conversion dealer and have your modifications installed. If you are purchasing a new vehicle ask your dealer what type of reimbursement their company offers for adaptive equipment Almost all car companies offers a certain reimbursement for the cost of adaptive devices.
No," Hi my name 's adam , i 'm a fifth year medical student . Can i check your name and date of birth harry miles 21 to the 10th 1998 great and what 's brought you in today . I'Ve just had this whole chest pain since last night um . I did n't really think anything of it"
No," at the time and it just got worse and worse as the evening went on , and then it was particularly bad in bed and could n't get a wink of sleep all night . Okay , can you tell me a bit more about it ?"
No," , okay i 'll . Just ask you a few more questions about that . So you 've told me the pain 's in the middle : did it come on suddenly or gradually uh ? I ? I guess it was suddenly , but it was the pre . The pain"
No," was gradually worse , so it suddenly sort of . I felt it , but it was n't too bad and then the pain got worse as it went on and how would you describe the pain ? It 'S sharp , sharp sort of almost catches ."
No," My breath quite a lot - and you said it 's it 's in the middle of your chest slightly on the left side . So does it go anywhere like to your left arm or to your jaw , or does it just stay there ? No , it stays there and when you get the pain"
No," , do you get any other symptoms ? At the same time , you like breathlessness palpitations , do you feel sweaty no and when the pain comes on , how long does it last for constant ? It 'S constant"
No," , and on a scale of one to ten , how bad would you say the pain is if ten 's , the worst pain you can imagine , and One 'S no pain at all , it 's pretty bad . It 'S pretty bad ! I i do n't like the number scale . I just think one man 's tens"
No," heart attack if i 'm honest , okay , why is that uh three years ago my dad passed away from a heart attack , um and so just kind of since then really have"
No," just been a bit more concerned about my heart . You know i keep thinking about you know being in the hospital , and things like that , so i 've tried to be a bit more sort of cautious , i 'm sorry to hear that it must have been"
No," If that 's okay , have you felt unwell recently , uh , i had well . I had the sniffles last week and a bit of a sore throat but uh . You know i came through worse that now um well until last night . Basically any dizziness feeling faint or have you"
No," fainted ? No , no , nothing like that . Have you felt sweaty or had any night sweats , no , no any weight loss ? I wish any pain or swelling in your legs . No , have you had any trauma or injuries to"
No," your chest wall ? No , i 'm just going to summarise back what you 've just told me . If i get any of it wrong , just let me know : you 've got a sharp central , slightly leftsided chest pain , which started last night after work ."
No," It feels worse when you lie down and when you take a deep breath , it 's slightly better when you lean forwards , you 've had a sniffle and a sore throat recently . Does that sound about right , yeah , yeah and do you have any other medical conditions"
No," No , i i had my second cover job about six months ago , though . Okay , are you allergic to any medications or drugs that you know of ? Ah , not that i know of so you mentioned your dad . Had a heart attack , how old was he when he had a"
No," heart attack uh , he was about 68 years old . I think okay , and are there any other medical problems that run in the family nah ? I 'M just going to ask you a few more"
No," you smoke and how often might you smoke uh , maybe about once a week every other week , maybe go through a couple ? Maybe three : okay and do you drink alcohol , uh , yeah , so uh ? If there 's like a good"
No," at home , either um but yeah about probably three or four . Is that normal strength , larger yeah , yeah , just sort of stuff off the tap okay ? How often do you go out with your mates for a drink uh ? Maybe once a week every other week , it 's"
No," more just . If there 's a good game on , you know just an excuse to see my mate basically , do you take any recreational drugs or any any drugs that are n't prescribed from the gp uh about six months ago"
No," me and my mates went to a nightclub and we we had A bag of cocaine with us have you taken any recreational drugs since then ? No , no , no , it was just a sort of oneoff at the time . Okay , do you live by yourself , uh ? No ! I live with my fiance"
No," day off today . Do you have any other questions ? That 'S the end of the consultation thanks for talking to me today . Harry is a 23 year old plumber , who presented with a oneday history of sharp central chest pain . The pain was"
No," history and he does n't take any regular medications . He smokes two or three cigarettes a week and drinks , three or four pints of normal strength lager every week . He reports using cocaine six months ago , but denies taking it since then . Harry 'S"
No," primary concern is a myocardial infarction , as his dad had a heart attack aged 68 and he 'd . Like reassurance with regards to this based on the history today , the most likely diagnosis is pericarditis . Other"
No," differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism , pleurisy and musculoskeletal chest pain to complete my assessment . I 'D perform a full cardio respiratory examination . If you enjoyed this video check out the geeky medics collection of over 500 oski"

No," health anxiety . Okay , now , as with with anything that we we teach if you 're dealing with physical symptoms , if you 're dealing with something that you know , you 've got some serious physical symptoms step . One is always going to be consulting with a health professional ."
No," Yes , what we 're going to be talking about is things that you can be doing in addition to seeing checking making sure that what physical symptoms that you have , you know you want to be checking in with a doctor on right . So , yes , medical treatment is obviously"
No," your . Is that a word ? Yes , so it 's it 's along those lines , and so so so here 's what to do in the moment . Let 'S say I and I I had fibromyalgia and IBS , so I know what it 's like to have pain or whatever other symptoms , fatigue or whatever 's going on in the moment , and you know it"
No," you have a pain that you not you know , you have n't had before get it checked out , but if it 's something you know happens regularly and you 've checked yourself out , you 've had yourself checked by a doctor , there 's no medical reason for it"
No," something like let 's say I get regular panic attacks or heart palpitations or you know obscure , pains and things that I know , I 'm not a medical there 's , no medical reason for them . I notice it and then I do what I remind myself : it 's there 's nothing serious there and then"
Environment," wonderful music . Put some calm , inspiring music on . Do some physical exercise . If you can play a game , think about things you love . So this is something very simple you can do . Think about someone or something you love could be a pet could be a person , you know , could be a place ."
No," palpitations , so you say I noticed that every now and then my heart rate increases , and I do n't know why , and I start to get panicky about it . First thing : what 's what 's the worst thing about that , I feel fear . I feel scared . I feel like something : bad is gon na happen"
No," those childhood memories to the opposite , positive and empowering practice , the new ones and then and keep doing that until you can think about the symptom ? So I 'm just now , I 'm not feeling it now , I 'm just remembering the heart palpitations and not feel the fear not feel whatever"
No," other part of this question is about allergies , impaling , dealing with allergies , skin reactions in that kind of thing , and I know the pain that can be kind of complex . Because again , that 's I mean people can have some pretty serious and even in some cases , life"
No," used to have seasonal allergies . Every spring , I would you know , have it have all kinds of hay fever symptoms I break out in rashes and it was pretty intense through most of the summer , and you know I I took you know like the overthecounter medication to kind of"
No," combat that , or did Just cope yeah managing , but when I started to deal with the stress , so I was n't specifically focusing on trying to get rid of the allergies . I was dealing with stress and anxiety in general and , as I was bringing my stress levels down as I was"
No," eliminating anxiety from my life , the allergies just disappeared , yeah now cause and effect relationship . Don'T know do n't care , do n't have the allergies anymore and I do n't have the stress levels . So again the point is , bringing the stress levels down is n't going to"
No," doctordoctor it . You know you can do a lot to limit say if you wo n't have , if you have physical symptoms and health anxiety , stop watching stuff and reading stuff and listening to stuff that triggers you , that 's a big thing . You can do to start to help yourself to improve"
No, able to Start to raise your emotional state that normal state that we 're in so for years decades . I lived in a state of anxiety and it was kind of this low level anxiety . That was always there and maybe it would peak up and down . But there was always that sense of anxiety
Environment," , so that became a normal state and I think that we get into states that will in fact cause disease will cause physical symptoms and , just by practicing ESC your training , your brain , it 's a physiological system whereby you 're training , your"
Environment," I couldn't figure it out. I was exhausted all the time. I was just feeling so hopeless, I didn't even want to go to the gym anymore. I can't remember the last time I got a good night's sleep. I noticed I was starting"
No," to pack on some extra pounds, too. And I also had this discomfort in my back. I just didn't feel like doing the things I usually enjoy. After several weeks of this, I decided to make an appointment with my doctor. Major depressive disorder, or MDD,"
No," affects people's lives in many different ways. In MDD there are at least five symptoms of depression that must be present during the same two week period, with at least one of the symptoms being diminished interest and pleasure"
No," or depressed mood. The symptoms of MDD that are related to your physical health can include a lack of energy or feeling fatigue, decrease in movement or speech, feeling restless or unable to sit still, and fluctuation in weight."
No," Some individuals also experience associated symptoms like unexplained pain, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems. During my initial exam of Jamal, I asked him some questions I could tell he wasn't expecting,"
No," regarding his mood or his ability to focus and remember things. I told him he was likely experiencing major depressive disorder, or MDD. I explained that his physical symptoms were common to have with MDD, and the relationship between physical symptoms"
No," and depression can be hard to untangle. I recommended a therapist who specialized in treating depression and I also gave him some tips to help initially with his symptoms. At first, I was embarrassed about going to therapy."
No," But I finally talked to a close friend and my family about it, and they were so supportive and encouraging that it actually made me feel better. There are several steps that may help address the physical symptoms that you are experiencing."
No," See your doctor. It's important to first rule out other health problems that could be causing physical symptoms. Share the whole picture with your doctor about your physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. Once you have been diagnosed,"
No," mental health professionals can help treat mental and emotional symptoms. Make a plan and stick to it. There are many things you can do, but you'll need the support of friends and family, too. Set realistic goals, stay active,"
No, and ask for help when you need it. Do your research and keep learning. And always make sure you communicate openly and honestly with your doctor and other healthcare professionals. Staying on my treatment journey from MDD takes a lot of work.
No," But it's so important to stay positive and keep working toward treatment goals. Since using some of the tips my doctor recommended, I have begun to feel better physically, which has made it easier to focus on treating the other symptoms of my MDD."
Environment, I go to the gym once a week and make time for my friends.
No," concerned , but when they do lab work and when they 're trying to figure out what 's going on , they realize there 's nothing wrong . That everything is fine and what they do is they label you with anxiety , now"
No," you 've grown up thinking . Anxiety is all in your head . So how can anxiety create such physical symptoms ? In fact , you may not even be anxious a lot of the times , so why are you experiencing the symptoms ? Well , what i want to talk about in this"
No," video is how anxiety is not just all in the head : it 's actually very physical . What i want to talk about in this video is why anxiety creates such physical symptoms and , more importantly , what to me what to do to make this go away once and"
No, for all . So you do n't have any more physical symptoms where you do n't have any more anxiety and you can just go back to living so pay attention . So before i get into all the symptoms that anxiety can produce .
No," I remember when i was struggling with debilitating anxiety . I was experiencing such bizarre physical symptoms that i was convinced it was n't anxiety . I was like no , this is something serious and if the doctors are n't finding it by"
No," anxiety , and i remember when they used to say anxiety . I used to think well they 're just saying it 's all in my head , but like i 'm feeling nauseous like i 'm feeling sick like i 'm , not feeling good and i had"
No," an array of physical symptoms , i was feeling nauseous . I had this headband feeling i was clenching my jaw . I was having terrible morning anxiety , but for me , nausea was the biggest symptom , and the"
No," first thing to really understand is that this idea that anxiety is kind of all in the head is partly true , but also not really true , see anxiety , is n't just about being nervous . It 'S not about just being concerned or or"
No, worried about something anxiety to its fundamental core is about survival . See anxiety is more about what we call this fightorflight response . Anxiety is more focused on keeping you alive .
No," our bodies kind of change physiologically during this threat , and so what happens is that anxiety creates these physical symptoms that are very , very strong . So it 's really easy to think that oh"
No," okay , well , anxiety is just me being nervous before you know this video , but it 's more than that anxiety is more about survival . So what you 're experiencing is not just mental kind of symptoms , but very physical symptoms as well ."
No, You start experiencing palpitations dizziness nausea vertigo . You start experiencing all these things now . The thing that 's really interesting here is that it 's one thing to experience these symptoms when
No," you 're actually under threat , but what happens when you 're not experiencing any threat when there 's there 's nothing to be worried about what happens is is that the fear of the symptom becomes ? Essentially , the the fightorflight response in itself"
No," , and what i mean by that is the fear of the symptom , is what 's keeping it alive . So for me , just feeling nauseous was getting me concerned was getting me worried . I started having anxiety about just"
No," being nauseous . I kept thinking . Well , what if it 's this , but what , if it 's that , but what , if the doctors missed something and then i went on google and google would say something else , and then i would go on these forums and forums would talk about ? Oh , like you"
No," what 's wrong with me and i 'm just gon na have to live with this forever . So what was happening was that i was actually making myself more and more anxious and so on . One part i was feeling like the nausea was actually creating my anxiety , but in fact"
No," it was the opposite . My anxiety was creating the nauseous symptoms and once i focused on the anxiety , all the nausea ended up disappearing now . For me it was nausea for you . It may be something else . It may be dizziness"
No," , palpitations , vertigo and maybe um sweating it may it may be whatever the headband sensation . If you had to list out every single symptom that anxiety can produce , i mean it would be an encyclopedia . I mean the symptoms , never end . So the"
No," first thing to understand is : if you really want to know okay well , if it 's anxiety or if it 's something else , the best way to do it is just by getting it ruled out by your doctor . Doctors are very , very good at diagnosing and seeing , if whatever is causing"
No," , your issues is physical in nature . Now , if it 's not physical in nature and the doctors are clearing , you that 's a great sign . That means it 's anxiety , and that means you can focus on that and you can get that fixed . So the first things first is to throw"
No," all your symptoms under the anxiety umbrella , get everything ruled out by your doctor and make sure that everything is clear . Once that 's the case , what that really tells you is that , even though you 're experiencing physical"
No," symptoms , the cause of it is not physical , the cause of it is this fight or flight response . The cause of it is anxiety . So if you fix the anxiety , all these symptoms disappear , all of them , the rule of thumb to really look at is"
No," well what symptoms did you have before you have anxiety before you had your first panic attack ? What symptoms were you experiencing if you 're experiencing those symptoms ? That may be a different topic , but if you start experiencing all this after"
No," anxiety , then there 's a very good chance . It 'S all anxiety . So , just to recap , the first thing i really focus on is getting everything ruled out by your doctor . So once you get a clean bill of health"
No," , then this is typically where i get questions where okay sean , like i understand all my symptoms , being physical , but i have this one symptom . That is absolutely terrifying me . That is way too strong to be anxiety and for me in fact i had the same thing for"
No," me . It was being nauseous for you , maybe dizziness and maybe nausea , maybe palpitations and maybe vertigo i mean like . If you had to write out every single symptom that anxiety can create that 's physical . I mean it would be an encyclopedia . It"
No," would be an encyclopedia that never ends so remember . If you really want to know , is this anxiety or is this something else just getting it ruled out by your doctor ? Tells you if your doctor says there 's nothing to worry about"
No," , then , is anxiety now that you 're focusing on anxiety , it 's really important to understand how anxiety works , how anxiety can create such physical symptoms . So what happens is that people have no problems kind of putting all their physical symptoms under the anxiety"
No," umbrella , except for maybe one symptom , and this is typically the most scariest symptom for me . I was concerned that what if the nausea was the onset of something else - maybe an autoimmune condition or maybe some sort"
No," of like digestive issue , and for me that terrified me , i did n't want that . So for me that was the scariest symptom for you . It could be something else , so it 's very important . First things , first , put everything under the anxiety"
No," umbrella , put every single symptom , even the most debilitating symptom . The next step is really to focus on okay . Well , how does anxiety create all these physical symptoms ? How does something ? That 'S"
No," not anything physically wrong with you , create such strong physical symptoms . Well . In order to understand that you have to understand what we call the fight or flight response , this is an innate mechanism designed to protect you , and what happens is that ?"
No," explained by this fight or flight response , and so in order to understand a little bit more about how anxiety creates physical symptoms , you really have to understand the mechanics , and so , if you want to know"
No, how does anxiety create physical Symptoms i 'll put a link down report below to a private report . This is exactly what i do to show individuals how to fully come out of anxiety . This is exactly
No," what i use for my recovery and it 's exactly what i use to help others overcome too and before we even get them to start . Overcoming the first thing we do is help them understand how anxiety creates these physical symptoms , so i 've put a link down below"
No," whole point of this report , so the link down is below so definitely check it out . So the last thing to really focus on is how to make these anxiety symptoms go away . So remember , the first thing is really identifying . Is it anxiety or is it not"
No," and the way to do that is just by getting everything ruled out by your doctor once everything 's ruled out , then you can throw it under the anxiety umbrella . The second thing is to really understand the mechanics of anxiety"
No," , which that report is really going to help you understand how does anxiety create such physical symptoms , then ? The last thing to really do is focus on making these symptoms go away . Now , typically , what you 've done is you 've tried to do something to make these"
No," physical symptoms go away , but the truth is : is that whatever 's causing this is n't really physical in nature ? Right , like we talked about it 's that fightorflight response , the focus now is actually to allow the symptoms to be there ."
No," Here 'S ? Why ? Because , as you 're focusing on anxiety , once you focus on anxiety , all the symptoms disappear , focusing on anxiety and fixing , the anxiety is different than fixing a headache"
No," or fixing something else physically wrong with you focusing on anxiety . Is you just allow it to be there see once you allow it to be there once , let 's say for me , it was being nauseous . I just allowed myself to feel nauseous"
No," and i just continued on with my day , and what was happening is that i was feeling nauseous , but i started losing the fear of being nauseous . What that did was is that it told my fightorflight response , my anxiety"
No," that there 's actually no threat , there 's nothing to worry about . You know you 're in this fightorflight mode , but there 's no threat sean 's , not responding in fear he 's allowing it to be there , and so what that does is that that tells your"
No," nervous system , calm down , you do n't need to be in this fight or flight flight or flight Mode and then what that does is that that actually lifts it as the fightorflight response lives . Ironically , your physical symptoms end up disappearing"
No," , see you 're used to try to fix your physical symptoms directly , but when it 's anxiety , you have to fix the physical symptoms indirectly , when you fix the anxiety that fixes the physical symptoms , so the best bet is just allow it to Be"
No," there all your symptoms and continue on living a lot of people think anxiety . Overcoming anxiety is like overcoming the flu right . You get the flu , so you stay at home for a few days and then , once you get better , you go back to"
No," work . Anxiety . Is the opposite go back to living while you 're experiencing these physical symptoms , these physical symptoms , a wo n't hurt ? You b are n't indicative that there 's something physically wrong with"
No," It 'S very important that you answer these three questions to the best of your ability . We want people in the group , but we 're also trying to maintain the integrity of the group . You'Ve been on anxiety forums , you 've"
No," seen how toxic it can get , how much fear mongering they could be . We do n't want this place . We do n't want this facebook group to be focused on that . We really want people to fully overcome and go back to living . So if that 's you"
No," It 'S important to remember our physical health affects our mental health and vice versa . What we do to our bodies makes a big difference to how we feel physical activity . Diet , alcohol , smoking and drugs can all affect our mental"
No," health and wellbeing in different ways . So , let 's talk about them : physical activity releases , feelgood hormones called endorphins which help us sleep and feel better . It also improves our physical fitness"

No," , which will get you up and running in just nine weeks . Eating better can play a big role in our health and wellbeing . It wo n't come as a surprise to learn that what we eat and how much plays a big part in our physical health"
No," , which can impact our mental health too . Ideally , we should aim to eat a healthy , balanced diet with plenty of fruit and veg . It 'S important to keep an eye on your calories and minimize foods that are high in sugar , fat and"
No," salt for helpful tips on eating a better diet check out the 1u website . Alcohol , caffeine , tobacco and even drugs may seem tempting when we 're stressed or tired and when we use them to try and cope , the"
No," idea of stopping them can feel like it would make things even harder , but they can cause more problems than they solve , especially long term . All these habits can complicate our sleep patterns and affect how anxious and depressed we"
No," feel so try cutting down or even quitting , and remember that there 's support available alcohol in particular can worsen our moods , so cutting down can really help us feel better for more help . Cutting down you can"

No," Today 'S topic is drug abuse , drug abuse also called substance . Abuse is an illness that is characterized by a destructive , patterned use of illegal or legal drugs or medication . The condition affects the person 's brain and behavior such that they are unable to control the"
No," use of the drug , to the point that it interferes with their ability to function . The drug user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods that are harmful to themselves or others . Some of the most commonly used drugs are alcohol , cocaine , opioids , benzodiazepines"

No," For the most part, this depends on how a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways that can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere from seconds to hours, depending on factors like how it's administered."
No," The slowest method is to take a drug orally because it must be absorbed by our digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into the bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously works quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly into the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches the gates of its destination, the brain."
No," The entrance to this organ is guarded by the bloodbrain barrier, which separates blood from the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous substances out. So all drugs must have a specific chemical composition which gives them the key to unlock this barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere with the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons and synapses."
No," A drug's effectiveness stems from its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions at different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters being spread. For instance, common antidepressants, like SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates our moods."
No," This effectively pushes more of it into the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin and noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure."
No," Those same neurotransmitters also affect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing the production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed or sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain that we're still trying to understand."
No," Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some of the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD,"
No," mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact on the neural circuits involved in perception, learning, and behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs have such powerful impacts."
No," Even if some of these effects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs are highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter the brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently rewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn,"
No," and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know about drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones we've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs and the brain, the possibilities will also increase"
No," Cigarettes aren’t good for us. That’s hardly newswe’ve known about the dangers of smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens as their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically when we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation,"
No," Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases the likelihood of infections, as well as chronic diseases like bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is to keep the airways clean. It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide"
No," between the lungs and blood. A toxic gas called carbon monoxide crosses that membrane into the blood, binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported around the body. That’s one of the reasons smoking can lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath."
No," Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant called nicotine to the brain, triggering the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters including endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations which make smoking highly addictive. Nicotine and other chemicals from the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction of blood vessels"
No," in the body’s DNA that make cancers form. Additionally, ingredients like arsenic and nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair, thus compromising the body’s ability to fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every three cancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung cancer."
No," Smoking can cause cancer in multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder for women to get pregnant. And in men, it can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive upside"
No," After two days, the nerve endings responsible for smell and taste start to recover. Lungs become healthier after about one month, with less coughing and shortness of breath. The delicate hairlike cilia in the airways and lungs start recovering within weeks, and are restored after 9 months, improving resistance to infection."
No," By the oneyear anniversary of quitting, heart disease risk plummets to half as blood vessel function improves. Five years in, the chance of a clot forming dramatically declines, and the risk of stroke continues to reduce. After ten years, the chances of developing fatal lung cancer go down by 50%,"
No," probably because the body’s ability to repair DNA is once again restored. Fifteen years in, the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same as that of a nonsmoker. There’s no point pretending this is all easy to achieve. Quitting can lead to anxiety and depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal. But fortunately, such effects are usually temporary."
Environment," and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms, without the addition of other harmful chemicals. Counselling and support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay cigarettefree. That’s good news,"
No," What is deep , snail dips here , also known as breathlessness , is a subjective sensation of an uncomfortable awareness of breathing . It is a frequent symptom occurring in 50"
No," to 70 percent of dying patients . What can cause dipstill dipsnia can result from physical illnesses , for example , pneumonia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or organ failures . It can also be caused"

No," pharmacological measures to manage deep snare . Some of the nonpharmacological measures are modifying activities to help patients conserve energy , such as sitting on a commode while showering"
Environment," , instead of standing up modifying environments for patients such as sitting them upright and supported by nice , fluffy , pillows or providing fan to relieve their breathlessness put patients . Belongings close to them so"
No," that it is within reach just like how you want your tv remote to be beside you on your channel surfing right , providing oxygen when necessary and providing touch and comfort . Moving on to the pharmacological measures , there are two main treatment goals"

Environment," Saskatchewan , oh , my goodness , and she has received extensive training in real realist , evaluative approaches and mixed methods and uses these methodologies in our current projects related to improving Health Services deliveries which all of us patients are so grateful"
No," being here without further Ado , I will pass it along to both of you . Well , thank you so much for those introductions Jill and thank you so much to lung sauce for everything that you do to support . Um our patients in the community - I I"
No," from my contacts with people that are dealing with persistent symptoms along covid and he 's going to bring in some of the the newest evidence to help to address those questions and he 's also gon Na , I think I think , what 's what what I like about this presentation is : give us"
No," lot , but maybe is n't well understood it 's it 's a subjective description of the sensation of feeling shorter breath or having difficulty breathing . That 'S that 's its simple definition and you know so for the most part , we equate it with shortness of breath , and this"
No," over there and then the muscles start to carry out that action and they start asking for things . They start asking for oxygen and energy and and the blood needs to deliver that , and the Heart needs to push the blood to deliver . That and the lungs need to pick up oxygen"
No," so just to to . Is there a relationship between dysmia and and the mind like anxiety , um , some of those yeah ? You know you talked about Central mechanisms , but I think that 's a little bit different than maybe anxiety . So can"
No," you tell us more about that ? Yeah , like the central mechanisms ? Are things we do n't control they 're they 're done automatically in the the lower part of our brain and what you 're talking about is anxiety , which is you know above the tentorium , as we say in in medicine . So in"
No," the cerebrum , where we do our thinking - and you know , the anxiety can be a a driver of the sensation of shortness of breath . Anybody that 's had a panic attack would probably tell you that that 's very much a part of that or even you know , lesser forms of anxiety can produce that"
No," contributing , so I think that leads into our next question , which is like . Why does why do why do people have problems with dyspnea after a covid19 infection like ? Why does it you know ? I mean lots of us : have the flu we ca n't breathe for maybe a few days it 's hard and then we get"
No," it 's from covid19 influenza , which you referenced or other viral illnesses , is not particularly uncommon in each of those . Viruses behaves differently , they 're , not the same , and some some take longer than others to resolve in the context of covid . What we 've learned is"
No," start to think this is now chronic long , covid type symptomatology and you know that 's driven by things like inflammation um , particularly in the initial phases and then recovery from that um . But you know there can be other"
No," reasons why a person might feel shorter breath . Some people could be that they 've had some anxiety associated with having covet to your example of that um , or there may be some depending on the severity of the illness that they present with . There may be some actual"
No," struggle when you get up to move after that , because the muscles have n't been put to the test and have started to to decondition and so that can produce some some shortness of breath and and uh fatigue . So one of the questions"
Environment," um that I I would like to ask you is like : should people try to exercise after a covet infection , if they 're short of breath , what how ? How do we ? How do we manage all of you know ? You know often , if , if someone 's short of breath , the advice is like you should get out , you should"
Environment," I 'm gon na answer the physiotherapy part . Second , but you know repeat the first question again : well : it 's really should people try to exercise after they 've had a covet infection , because I I 've heard from many patients now actually that um the advice"
Environment," they 're getting is that you know they they need to start to exercise , But but some some for some patients , it 's it 's really hard . It 'S actually impossible to to begin to exercise because for multiple reasons for fatigue , for shortness of breath , for all kinds of"
Environment," um , and - and by that I mean if , depending on how bad the symptoms are , that should dictate how much you should be expecting of Yourself , for starters , in terms of the activity that you do and how we Define exercise , I mean as soon as I say , you should go exercise Donna , you 're already"
Environment," thinking what what kind of running shoes am I wearing Lululemon or Nike , or you know , like they 're . We have this mental construct around . What exercise is and really the point of this is from from my perspective , as a physician is actually it 's around function . Meaning can you"
Environment," walk ? Can you achieve the things you need to do just to maintain your life , and so you know I by saying I want you to move and exercise . It 'S really . I want you to do what you can within your symptoms and and that will be dependent on where that person is at right , and the"
No," passing out . I want you turning blue . If you have chest pain , that 's a bad sign . You know , but if you 're , if you 're feeling a bit short of breath and breaking a bit of a sweat because you 're trying to even if it 's only for a short distance , that that to me is a good thing for you"
No," um with respect to the involvement of a physiotherapist yeah , they physiotherapists are our partners for a reason . You know they have a lot to offer uh patients that doctors ca n't offer um , and so you know , does every patient that has shortness of breath from covid"
No," need to see a physiotherapist ? I think the answer would be no , but there would be situations where they could be helpful . So , for example , if one of the drivers is muscle , weakness and fatigue and so on , they could be quite helpful there ."
Environment," Similarly , people that have um there are some patients that have sort of uncoordinated breathing patterns afterwards , which is uh , not super common , but it 's out there they can help them with . You know , training to try and sort of overcome that and reestablish a more"
No," shortness to breath like when , should when should they start to say this is too long this I 've been living with my shortness of breath For too long - and I need to see I I need help , I need more help than right . So the I need help question again"
No," is contextual , so you know if even early in the phase of illness , if somebody 's shortness of breath is just getting worse and worse and worse and worse , that 's a sign to go , seek attention right , but let 's just talk about it As if it 's someone that does n't need to be in the"
No," hospital has some shortness of breath - that 's persistent um over the course of that first 10 days , or so , where you 're infectious and then into the subsequent weeks . Most people will recover in the within about four weeks"
No," , like when do you suggest people see a doctor about their disability like when , should they seek attention yeah ? So if they 're like , if it 's persisting beyond that four weeks , five weeks , if you 're getting into that time frame , that 's the time to start thinking . Well , maybe I"
No," breath um ? Having had covet helps narrow the field a little bit but um yeah . That would be my . My thinking is that once it 's going past four to five weeks , that would be a time to to go . See"
No," your your family physician to say : hey , I 'm still having symptoms . So when I go to my doctor , what kinds of um tests might he or she order for it to check , check my dysmia out right , so they 'll presumably do a physical examination to listen for abnormalities"
No, that might lead them to one sort of particular area of thinking Or another they 'll probably be able to check oxygen saturation as well and then in terms of tests they might do a chest xray depending on what they hear they might do . Spirometry some offices have the
No," handheld spirometers in them , which is a measurement of lung volumes . That can be quite helpful . Some may send a patient for a full pulmonary function test , perhaps and then blood tests . You know it 'd be good to rule out anemia as a cause of shortness of breath in some"
No," I would be referred to see , someone like you right as A general rule of thumb , a family physician or any other physician , that 's encountering a respiratory issue in a patient , would ask for , say my involvement"
No," when they 've reached the limit of what they feel they can do , either from a knowledge base or or from a treatment perspective . Once they 've reached their own limits , that 's generally when they try and get a specialist myself involved and there 's no sort of written you have"
No," , is not predicated on everybody . Seeing a respirologist . That 'S not a it 's , not really a manageable thing , for there are n't that many of us um , but at the same time it 's designed to to put the tools into the community . So"
No," patients do n't have to travel to Saskatoon or Regina , where that 's , where respirologists are in Saskatchewan and a lot of our patients and live outside of the two major centers . So it 'd be nice to have um strategies out in the community to to"
No," deal with the majority of this and then involve respirologists where where we can be most effective and helpful okay , so thank you so um when I I go to see my family doctor . What kind of medications might they like ? What what could I expect ? Are there"
No," asthmalike scenario might Be helpful in that context . Um , you know so there are there , are n't any specific pills or treatments that one should walk in the door . Saying I better"
No," be getting this at the end of this visit , because it 's going to be driven by what the doctor thinks is wrong and whether or not a particular treatment might be effective like the office spirometry may help them with some of that decision . Making ."
No," out very easily , and so , if somebody Has asthma or COPD what we call obstructive lung diseases , then it 's harder for it to come out , so it takes longer and um so that that 's a tool . That 'S very good at identifying that particular group of diseases"
No," um , as well as what we call restrictive diseases . It may give us Clues to that , but we have to do more advanced testing beyond that to confirm it . So so complicated answer . So , in the context of a patient who 's feeling shorter breath from covid , they may choose to do this"
No," abnormality is , they may want to repeat it at some point to see . Is it still like this , or has it responded to whatever treatment I have employed ? Does that make sense yeah ? So some of some of who I 've talked to have hats , spirometry done and they"
No," um and so to me , if the spirometry is normal and they do n't have any symptoms that make me think that there 's you know background asthma , that I need to Be doing some additional testing to look for then you know I might do a full pulmonary function test , as all they 've"
No, some rare causes of of shortness of breath in someone that has had covid yeah so um back to the question about they 're telling me my test is normal and I 'm still short of breath . I still have
No," dyspnea I 've . Unfortunately I see that - and I say unfortunately , because it 's very dissatisfying for the patient . When I say I 'm sorry , I ca n't find a cause that I can put my finger on and say . Aha , this is what 's wrong with your lungs per se"
No," , and so we have to think about what else could be contributing to shortness of breath in this individual , and you know it 's not a question of saying the test is normal , does n't mean we do n't believe you . We do believe you , we want to help you , but we have to start thinking well ."
No," to those first principles of well what could be causing this Okay , thank you so for people , maybe that have have had diagnoses of asthma or COPD in the past , um what you know how how might covet affect"
No," them would it would it have necessarily made their asthma or COPD worse or better , not better generally , but uh um . You know , in terms of worse I mean it 's , this would be a a well describe Trigger or for an exacerbation"
No," of either of those diseases , just like many other viral illnesses . So the common cold , which is a coronavirus , could also trigger that in a COPD patient . Amongst many others , so you may see in that acute phase of illness that they have in addition to having covid now"
No," , they 've got an exacerbation of this underlying disease , which complicates things for them in the context of either of those depending on on the individual and how Their body has responded to the virus and What treatments have been been employed and so on . It may take a while"
No," to recover . You know it 's not unusual in a COPD patient , for example , for them to take weeks , sometimes even months , irrespective of covid , to get back to feeling like they 're at or near their Baseline before they became sick . Some people never get back to that Baseline"
No," um . So you know I , like I would n't be recommending to people in general to go out and buy pulse oximeters just because they 've had covid um . You know , I think , if somebody 's had a severe illness like they 've been"
No," people , like their shortness of breath , is just um ? You know they have been prescribed oxygen , and so can you tell us a little bit about that ? Well , let 's just back up for a second just separate , shortness of"
No," breath and oxygen from each other just a little bit , because you do n't necessarily feel shorter breath with low oxygen . Nor does shortness of breath mean that your oxygen is low right , so it and it so just reflexively giving oxygen , because"
No," somebody 's short of breath is not necessarily the the treatment strategy that should be employed . There 'S criteria , as you alluded to for coverage , that the Saskatchewan aids to Independent Living , so that 's a a branch of the Ministry of Health , will provide oxygen to anybody"
No," to help themselves like ? Is there anything they can do as a selfmanagement kind of strategy to to help make their your shortness of breath better um yeah ? So you know , I guess"
No," like her slip , breathing , for example , where they take a breath in through their nose and then like that . If it 's anxiety , sometimes Square wave Square wave breathing can be helpful where you like count in for four out for four , which is not a normal"
No," have been a little bit sedentary for a while , because they 've been sick and sometimes afraid to move right like there . There is that fear of of testing . My shortness of breath , I usually say like try and try and just see where you 're at and see if you can build on it"
No," make sense , yeah yeah , so is there anything that um people that have shorts should should avoid sitting still continuously honestly right , being sedentary , is n't is n't helpful , irrespective of your cause of dyspnea being still"
No," , which is like it 's an understandable response ? Don'T get me wrong like I get it right , it sucks to feel short of breath , it 's not a comfortable feeling and regardless of the cause - and I see lots of people with very Advanced lung disease because of my"
Environment," will be very difficult . So that 's where that comment came from um in terms of like avoiding certain environments or certain activities . I think you know the answer is not . There are no specific things that I would recommend in that regard , but back to my"
No," even people that do n't have lung disease and people that do have other lung diseases will sometimes report cold air makes me feel more short of breath . So , if that 's the case , then I would avoid it because it 's giving you grief"
Environment," um unless you have to be out to take care of the things you need to take care of in life . Okay , um and I have one last question , and can you just talk a little bit more about how shortness of breath affects Exercise"
Environment," capacity , our ability to to move in and how ? How how could we actually um measure what our Exercise capacity is or how could it be measured right ? So , let 's talk at the at the patient 's perspective to start well , you can do that for yourself . What can I do"
Environment," based on their age and their sex and so on . Um . We can do even more advanced testing , cardiopulmonary exercise testing , where we have them on a bike , and we have them breathing into a closed system where we can measure"
Environment," you know , oxygen exchange and carbon dioxide and um get a sense of their metabolic responses to exercise , and So on so that 's a very Advanced tool that that we can use to really start to . Disarticulate is the lungs . Is it the heart ? Is it the"
No," um , a study that Dr Kenton and I are involved with and um we 're looking at dyspnea And people that have had a covet infection , and specifically in adults that have had um shortness breath in the last 30 days that is n't related to something that 's"
No," preexisting like a preexisting , uh , heart or lung issue , and what we 're trying to do is is actually um . Look at how severe um the shortness of breath is , and some of the characteristics of that dyspnea and so we 're doing that in a few ways ."
No," One is by using um standardized measurements um , and these measurements also include measures of things like fatigue and anxiety and depression and quality of life . So that 's part of it , and then people come to a testing center to"
Environment," complete spirometry , which Dr Fenton talked about and also um . One of our physiotherapists or the student leads people through different types of exercise . Testing , including a few more things than you mentioned , like quadriceps , strength , testing and grip"
No," , strength and all kinds of other things , and so people do these tests at um at the beginning , and then they do it again at six months and um . You know one of the things that we 're doing is is giving people a copy of their results so that they can take"
No," those results back to their um they 're family doctors or their primary care providers , so that you know , if there 's followup , that 's needed . They can arrange that and what we , what we 're hoping to do is really to uh . We'Ve done quite a few tests already and we 've gone"
No," participate know it 's fine to Have people in France and Spain and Italy um , you know in involved in tests , but we we also really want to know what 's happening locally and I I think um Mark and I and the rest of our long cover team is we 're really"
No," coming days with the recording of tonight , as well as information about the study that they 're talking about a link as to how you can get involved . And if , if not you personally , it 's even a great way for you to share with friends and family colleagues"
No," tried to lump some of the questions uh together . Okay , so if you guys are ready um , this question um is to either of you , but are you seeing people um who experience shortness of breath after covid19"
No," um diagnosis that and is that primarily their symptom or you do you tend to see people with other symptoms As well like fatigue , or is it primarily just shortness of breath ? So I guess that that one 's probably best answer by me is the physician that would"
No," be seeing these people um . To be honest , uh dyspnea in isolation or shortness of breath in isolation is not as common and because most patients have more than one symptom . Honestly and like that 's , that 's a welldocumented thing throughout pretty much any study"
No," that 's been done on this on this area . Is that people present with multiple symptoms and so fatigue is very common , for instance of breath is common uh cough can persist for a while . Probably a third of people will have a cough that kind of prolongs for a while , and then"
No," only for adults . What um some some people are saying that they have children that have experienced shortness of breath . After a covid19 diagnosis , can they get involved as well ? Right now , this study is only for adults , but we 're increasingly hearing from"
No," um from people that , from from parents and also from even youth that are experiencing long covered symptoms , and my My Hope Is that we can . We can start to look at something for Youth and children very soon , but the study right now is is only for adults so"
No," um , hopefully in the future we can . We can do something with youth because there 's you know um and there 's not a lot of resources for for Children and Youth like when I looked at what was available because I 've had Parents contact me , there 's a"
No," Long covets Kid long , coveted , kids , Facebook page and there 's There 'S one in Canada um and that 's about the only actual resource that I could find like it 's it 's International . So I think the resources for children are actually"
No," quite Limited and we do n't know as much about you know long covered in kids . What what I 've read is that you know it 's it 's it 's similar picture in terms of you know the the number of the proportion of children that experience symptoms , but"
No," symptoms are different , like there 's a much higher prevalence of things like Encephalitis and other things that we do n't See in adults , so there 's a lot , there 's even more questions I think about children than there are about animals . But that 's that 's a great"
No," question . Thank you . Okay ! Well , we 'll we 'll see what the future brings there . Thank you um . Okay , this question is for Dr Fenton uh . Dr Fenton uh there 's some people uh that have been experiencing ongoing chest pain after having"
No," um ? So chest pain actually is a pretty common complaint afterwards , and it tends to also go down in prevalence , as time goes on . Just like shortness of breath does as well um , but if it 's continuing it , it really"
No," depends on the character of the chest pain as to sort of what direction one might go um in Men In some ways , it 's a little bit easier because women present with cardiac Chest pain differently than men . We know that , and so I always have sort"
No," um , something That does n't need a specialist attention necessarily too okay , and that that you know that 's positive , that you 're , seeing that chest pain decrease often in time . That 'S that 's a good thing to to take from that too . So , thank you for answering that"
Environment," person and The Exercise capacity is done in person um . We have people asking if they can travel to see you for that . Well , if , if people are interested , I mean those those are tests that"
Environment," um , I 'm sure are available in different provinces . Um , you know , the spirometry is something that 's pretty commonly available in The Exercise . Capacity testing is something that many physiotherapists do um . You know we 're also really interested"
No," I think one of the things our study is really going to add is a better understanding of um . You know what are the sensations like , what what is it like and how is it different from other kinds of dyspnea like if you , if you run a race right or"
No," if you have COPD or if you have asthma like how ? How is that different ? So I think that 's what it 's going gon na add , but I think if anybody wants to talk to me , I 'm happy to you know to talk to a little about uh what we 're doing and if , if they want to come to visit , then I 'm"
No," I 'm always open To to out of Province visitors , wonderful Community , you do n't have to have an address in Saskatchewan to participate in the study , like that 's , not a rule of the study but pragmatically speaking , the answer is you probably do"
No," scrambling to put stuff together , they 're thinking through with proper , more sort of robust methodologies too , so you know , like the the the overall prevalence of Long Cove , it was thought to be actually potentially very high . Initially and now it 's estimated at her around six to ten"
No," percent of patients that have had covid will end up with longterm symptoms , and you know we may discover that that goes up a little bit or down a little bit depending on how things evolve . So so , um and - and I agree with what Donna said"
No," that there seems to be a bit of a signal surrounding the covid or covet the uh , the Delta variant um and even the original , the wild type um as well . Okay , thank you , um yeah ! It 'S always evolving , is n't it"
Environment," for patients that maybe are struggling to get moving again um to try and enroll in a pulmonary rehab program and the other part is , would you ever recommend ? Excuse me using something like a um respiratory training device"
No," , um , there 's , there 's many out there , something like um , there 's the Breather um that has some you blow into and has some resistance or incentive spirometry devices . Anything like that . If you 're experiencing shortness of breath"
Environment," um . You know like I , in the context of covid19 and Disney are related to that . You know I I do n't have science behind me to say : oh well , if you enroll patients in the in pulmonary Rehabilitation , this is what happens compared to patients that do n't right . I do n't have that"
No," particular uh perspective on it , but I do know that it 's a valuable thing for the following reasons : people build community there and that actually is a really important thing to be around people that understand you and where you 're coming from number two . If you 're exercising"
No," with a friend , you actually do more perform better like that 's , just the science tells us that so you know , and then in other diseases I can talk about well , it keeps them out of hospital all that , but I wo n't today uh in terms of Those other devices , you"
Environment," know you could go simple and just do deep , breathing exercises on your own without buying a device that creates resistance and so on , because if you 're feeling shorter breath and then you start breathing through a straw , that 's not going to feel very comfortable . So"
Environment," you know , I think you could just do simply big , deep breathing exercises to start with : okay , okay , wonderful , some great some great advice and and yeah . Certainly another thing with pulmonary rehab is you know , you 're supported by experts , so"
Environment," you 're not guessing what to do ? First , with your exercise , right they 'll tell you : well , that 's actually an excellent point . I mean there 's : there is an element of supervision there which , for the person , that 's nervous about this , actually there 's an a layer of"
Environment," psychological safety that comes with that too , but also really good advice . Yes , absolutely thank you , um , okay , so that there 's questions about um , there 's several patients that have said since they 've had covid19 they 've lost their voice"
No," um . But that would be my thinking around it that you know see your family physician of course , and I I 'm almost certain that this person would have , because I 'm sure it 's distressing them , but in having someone that can look at the vocal cords , I think is really"
Environment," know , if it 's not something that is medically remediable , there are um Rehabilitation , kinds of things that a speech language pathologist could do and - and I I think , that 's really really a valuable thing to consider . If there 's not a medical issue , that 's that 's the"
No," Before then , I need a full pulmonary function test to start to make sense of that pattern and and help me . It really does guide me in my thinking around . Is this an in the lung problem and outside the lung problem , and so on so um . So there are certain instances where"
No," profoundly um , because um . I think that , maybe in some small way I can make a difference by my efforts and I I um continue to try to do everything . I can and hope that in the end"
No," like asthma or COPD , okay , so yeah , I mean , I think the question actually Answers itself , in terms of why it 's important to me , because this is this - is an important thing in my life , I practice in respiratory medicine , and these are"
No," treatments for acute covid right . We'Ve had Pax lovid , it 's atrobomab and other things , but in terms of this , this sequelae of of the um infection that lasts in some people - that 's we 're in the discovery phase , still we 're in the describing digging in"
No," we really hope that that you will take part or share with friends , family colleagues that you think May um benefit from the study or or maybe a great participant to the study . So on that note , everyone take care , stay well and and breathe . I hope everyone can"
Environment," and social factors . So when we look at the economic factors again , countries that have high quality of life , high standards of living again have high income , have good job security and have a good standard of living . Okay"
Environment," , people have everything they need when it comes to physical attributes . They have a good access to diet and nutrition , so got good . Easy access to nutritious food they 've got good access to clean water . They have a stable climate which is good"
Environment," , we 've got happiness , security and freedom . So again , people with a higher quality of life are generally happier they 're , more secure , they 're , less worried about crime and they have more freedom to do what they want finishing with"
Environment," social factors . So again , we 've got a good society , set up lots of friends and family connections . Good education , services and good health care systems , quality life is really important when we 're discussing"
No, to compare evaluations . We need a single measure of benefit . One solution to this is the quality adjusted life year or quali . A quali combines length of life and quality of life into a single index measure . When we are looking at evaluating the benefit of treatments
No," , some treatments may have an impact on length of life , some on quality of life and some on both together . The quali takes both of these into account . Qualies give us a common unit of benefit which we can use in an economic evaluation to compare interventions both within and"
No," , 6 years lived in perfect health , valued as one would give 6 times . 1 , which equals 6 Qualys 10 years lived at a quality of life value does not point 5 would give 10 times not point 5 , which equals 5 collies to compare treatments . We can calculate the number of qualities for"
No, each and work out the difference between them to see if there is a quali game . Let 'S look at a few examples . Imagine we are comparing new treatment for kidney failure with an existing treatment . The new treatment would extend a person 's life by four years from two
No," years to six years and increased quality of life from not 075 to not 08 . With the existing treatment , a patient can expect to live for two years , but a quality of life value does not point seven five , two times not point , seven five equals one point five . Therefore , the"
No," existing treatment has a total of 15 qualies with the new treatment . The patient can expect to live for six years at a quality of life , valued at naught point eight six times , not point , eight equals four point . Eight . Therefore , the new treatment has a total of four"
Environment," What matters most to you , wealth or health happiness or schools is clean air as important as personal safety . Does your age , your gender or your income level affect your choices at the OECD ? We believe there is more to life than cold economic statistics . Our better life"
Environment," index has enabled people from all over the world to express what is most important to their lives . Their responses show that people in Latin America , eager for their children to have the best opportunities are more likely to rate education as the most important out of"
Environment," 11 life factors in North America , life satisfaction and worklife balance are top priorities , while in Europe the main concerns Are health education and the environment , people in the asiapacific region rates safety as a high priority , including in"
Environment," tend to assign more importance to income , while women give more value to work/life balance and community money and Happiness are paramount for young people , while the environment , civic engagement and health become more important with age . It 'S clear that a young boy in India"
No," shaisa suffer talk about a healthy lifestyle during this pandemic . The month before we were able to have muslim wellness foundations . Dr kamila rashad join us and talk about our mental health and wellness , and today we are so excited to have dr anum dawab"
No," here with us talking about a woman 's guide to aging and end of life care , i think a lot of times . This is a topic that we think about , but we do n't necessarily get to talk about"
No," until it is a little bit too late or you 're in the middle of things , and you wish you knew what to do so . I hope that you 're able to benefit from this and be prepared , if anything , were to happen , because"
No," experience and um . We hope and pray that this makes that part of your life a little bit easier and it makes allows you to make this easier for your loved ones , inshaallah . So welcome dr the wob ."
No," some of your wisdom . Um as a boardcertified , family , medicine and geriatric medicine physician , i think you know we . We do n't usually get to talk someone to someone who knows about all of this . So , thank you so much for joining us"
No," and some questions you can ask your doctors and some tips and then the second part of the presentation will be end of life care things like advance directives , dnr and um palliative care . A lot of these things that we have to deal with later on , so"
No," little bit about myself um i 'm doctor and i am board certified family , medicine , physician and geriatrician . I did my medical school from pakistan and then i did my residency in baptist health medicine"
No," family medicine , i do geriatrics , i was doing uh assisted living for a little bit um . Now . My more interest is in my enriched innovative medicine , more about antiaging , but i think all stages of life are worth"
No," form of calcium . To take best thing for calcium is to take it with your diet . So if your requirement is 1200 milligram per day , so you can divide so 12 uh . Each glass of milk is like"
No," cashew , milk or almond milk , um and then fruits and vegetables . That brings you more calcium , prunes have high doses of calcium , so ideal is with the diet . If you 're not taking enough , then calcium , citrate or comes in brand name called citric oil"
Environment," , so that will be a good option , but you have to take it in divided dose , so it your body , is not going to absorb more than 500 milligram at a time . Okay , then exercise so the new slogan is motion is lotion more . You are active , more you 're gon na stay active , so these"
Environment," are uh recommendations . 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise . So the goal is to move your um , your major muscle group , your legs , your hip , your back your abdomen chest and shoulder"
Environment," and usually walking , is , is one of that moderate intensity exercise that will give you a covering for all that . So if you 're walking 30 minutes every day , five days a week , that that 's a good start or you can do"
Environment," moderate intensity exercise like jogging and running for 75 minutes all right , let 's switch gear to memory loss , so there 's very fine line between what is normal , aging And what is dementia a lot of"
No," time ? People have this uh conception that it 's okay to lose memory when you 're , aging or uh loss of memory is part of aging um , which , which is not true . Learning new skill after a certain age becomes problem , so that"
No, can be considered as normal part of aging things that you already know when you start losing that that could be something problematic . Few things we can work on and they 're treatable . They present just like uh memory loss . They just present like
No," dementia , like thyroid problem like depression , vitamin b12 deficiency . So all these problems will look like memory loss , but they 're treatable causes one of the other problems like normal pressure"
No," and say i feel like i 'm losing my memory and then we go through memory testing and everything is fine . When true dementia happen , you people do n't have awareness , it 's usually family member , bringing them , and"
No," it 's like you forget what you forget . So these people have no uh understanding that they are losing memory , but the family members start picking up that . Okay mom has not paid bill for the last three months : she 's , not the same"
No, uh . You know her memory . Skills are not the same . How she was before . So this is this is what happened all this special skills that you learn as a part of your childhood um ? You know it 's a reversal for all that
No," , then you lose your ability how to coordinate clothing . Excuse me dressing , toileting and then further stages . We see they , you know they start losing vocabulary . I'Ve seen cases where um a person"
No," , so other important topic is incontinence and i brought this topic up because um especially female , they think . Okay , it 's it 's part of aging or we went through child birth . So it 's okay to have some incontinence , but it 's it 's ! It 'S !"
No," you know , you 're gon na have an accident . Sometimes we have uh stress and confidence that when you cough and you leak or you sneeze anytime , anything that increase your belly pressure , you 're gon na leak . So that 's these are the common type"
No," and uh till the age 74 . So this is kind of like typical age range . We can start early . Somebody has a concern , or somebody has family member with breast cancer and we can continue if somebody had abnormal uh ."
No, background . We all should get flu vaccine . The flu vaccine uh vaccination is out uh at age 65 . You get your prevanar and then following here you get pneumobacks . These are two different type of pneumonia
Environment," drive anymore , they usually stop or Family members start bringing in , but it 's important to talk to your doctor about it and it 's very sensitive issue . You know it 's about your safety people on the road , their safety , a"
No," gracefully . We should we should celebrate every stages of life , but then sometime things that make us look old uh . I see this culture , even not only people who are outside walking in community"
Environment," use appropriate devices for your safety and and the fact that it 's related to other problems down the road . For example , there are a lot of studies that prove that hearing loss has a factor for dementia , so it 's equal to ."
No," they know this is the next step giving appointment before they leaving . So these are few things that we do , but a lot of time . Uh you want to bring in your family members with you . You have another pair of the ears that"
No," um , because this happened um some people are very , very smart and i love those people who organize . They have their medication organized in pill box . They have an app or they always have their updated meditation list . Let 'S say if i"
No," Uh . Also , the fact that you want to tell your provider about overthecounter medication that you 're taking everything has benefit and side effect . I started learning a lot about naturopathic medicine about vitamins and how they influence our body ."
No," you know like a team leader , you 're missing that part . If a prescriber is prescribing , something and primary physician does n't know , there 's a drug interaction . Things get missed pretty easily . So i think it 's a good idea to have"
No," caregiver themselves for a long time . I i want to blame moms . They always put their children first family member first , and especially when we are we 're talking about the sandwich generation . You'Re taking care of a generation"
No," participate in prevention . A lot of people refuse vaccination . I'Ve seen folks that will not do any uh mammogram . I want - and i want to say our female , especially muslim , female they 're , so"
No," um and it 's about their dignity too . Sometimes they do n't want to involve the younger fellows or their kids . Thinking that okay , i got it . I can do it myself . I do n't need help , but it 's time in your life , when you"
No," start bringing in your loved one and start encouraging them that they should take part uh in their health care , and i do it all the time when and i 'm seeing a spouse , i 'm gon na tell Them , okay , bring your spouse next"
No," , but my my uh spouse will pick up or my family member will pick up so allowing help allowing your family to help you and You will see how many people are ready to pick up and you know ready to help you . So i"
No," with a question . I know i 've had to take care both of my parents . You know went through some illnesses and i was that caregiver , like you said i had little ones at home and i was taking care of of my"
No, parent and not necessarily taking care of myself . But i know it was very difficult as a child kind of taking care of um a parent to not get frustrated .
No," follow instructions , and that really led to a lot of stress for me personally and a lot of guilt and a lot of just anxiety , all kinds of emotions . So do you have any advice for the caregivers for those people that"
No, are coming with their parents to the doctor and and having to help their parents ? Sometimes the parents have dementia . Do you have any advice for the caregivers that have to be there for those
No," parents that are getting older and going through these things ? Absolutely so caregiver express is something that is very , very real , and then what happened in this situation is . Is that the same thing when you , when a parent is going to a doctor"
No," , half of the time pediatrician is talking to parents taking care of their anxiety about ? You know how to take care of child , so it 's kind of like a similar scenario . If you are my patient , my goal is"
No," center person who 's driving energy in the whole house . If you are sick , the whole family 's health will go down , so it 's very important that you get appropriate care . You uh see therapists ."
No," going to get worse . So you kind of plan for those stages , how much care your parents need . There are a lot of resources out in community about like dementia support groups . Are there their adult daycare ? Now the questions"
No," parent . At the same time , they will give you activity to keep their memory uh active . So so that is something that will give you a break . Let 'S say a few hours in a day when you want to go drop your kids to the school or do groceries so that that could be"
Environment," something um and then there are some assisted living places . They have a special unit called memory care unit . They are locked down unit , they want to make sure patients safety is there and they do n't"
No," behind . Okay . So let 's say : if i 'm , if i 'm a physician and i 'm trying to help your your mom , i wo n't be able to until you understand the whole process until you , you and i are on the same page . If , if you are um not doing good emotionally , i wo n't be"
No," enough calcium in your diet . Awesome . Thank you . Thank you very much yeah . I think that was it , so let me get out of the way and you can move on to the next part . Okay , so the next part of the topic will kind of revolve around the scenario ."
No," Okay , so this is about this female who presented uh an er , so she has diabetes , hypertension , heart failure ; copd she has alzheimer 's dementia and she 's unconscious in the hospital"
No," and she 's unconscious , because she has pneumonia she 's failure , she 's already on oxygen , uh , six liter per minute , and Then her blood pressure is dropping it 's 60 over 40 . Her heart rate is fast , her respiratory"
No," rate is fast , she has fever and then oxygen saturation is dropping , so she 's very , very sick and she is in er , but she can not talk for herself now the question become : what do we do for her ?"
No," Okay ? So there are , there are a few things that apply , so we see in the scenario she 's deteriorating and the family members are at bedside . So first thing we 're going to ask at this time and your physician will ask : what is the code status ? So let 's talk"
No," , which will be very difficult for kids or anybody to decide . They will be highly under pressured to decide what to do for mom or mom write down her own wishes . What i would do in such situation , so , let 's see so what"
No," So dnr is a um . This standard , yellow form and - and this is uh recognized all over florida - pretty much most of the state uh in us um . It has a legal value . You can do it in the hospital . You can do it with your"
No," primary care physician . We do it in the office all the time , so it it means do not do the chest compression do not resuscitate me and as a muslim . A lot of People believe in that , when the time comes , when allah is"
No," family member will choose or we 'll talk about what is a power of attorney or durable power of attorney , so either the family member will choose or the patient will choose that . What does she want with her life ? Something called"
No," intervention or full treatment like we would treat her like like anybody else , then the next part is about artificial nutrition . So if it 's acceptable to do uh nutrition by tube um or we can try find like a period of artificial tube or"
No," The post uh order stay in the hospital . Once you leave the hospital this . This order has no value , but the dnr is something that can stay in the community in wherever you go . Your dnr order will"
No," i keep in my office and truly it 's gift to your loved one . If my mom write down or my our parents write down how to treat our body , it 's gon na save so much anxiety , so much stress down the road , um and and i 've seen cases where"
No," um children go through this fight , saying that you were the last one Who pulled out the tube you made that decision so either the blame game continues for very , very long time . The guilt um the grudges continue for a"
No," long time and the person who makes the decision carry on the shoulder that i made the decision for my mom . I wish my mom had written something so five issues and advanced directive is all about that , so the first wish is"
No," regard , okay and then , when or if i 'm not able to so what 's what 's gon na Happen , how should you treat uh my body when i 'm not uh speaking myself and then what what kind of medical treatment i do or"
No," comfort . How comfortable i want to be it , and it happens when you 're talking about advanced pain , somebody who 's suffering from uh pain that is related to cancer or pain . That is not uh , not getting under control ."
No," people to treat me and what i want my loved one to know . So all these wishes and this five , which is going pretty detailed now this uh five issues also have uh uh like legal value in state of florida and many other uh wishes"
No," uh or many other documents . So you can uh , do that and you need a witness that is related and other is unrelated . You know prices , and this thing has legal value . You can go directly online , download your uh form and , and then you know this , this is"
Environment," much that is affecting your um psychosocial environment , um . You have a lot of burden uh from the disease and also the caregiver burnout , so one of the criteria to get enroll in palliative care - if you have , if"
No," you are too overwhelmed with what 's going on with the disease process , okay , so so the goal is to Relieve you from the suffering , and that includes taking care of the symptom , whether you have pain , whether you have"
No," intractable nausea , vomiting um . How much is because a lot of time people do n't take it easy . Like you know , you , people go in stages of depression . Fighting with these advanced diseases , helping you both write down your defense"
No," directive , improving um the communication , knowing what ? What are your values ? What are your expectations and then setting a patient 's goal based on what your values are and part of the palliative care is"
No," uh so many times or you know , with all the caregiver and burnout or the disease burned out , so the concept is just to provide you the care . The misconception about hospice is : can i still get uh treatment ? For let 's say if you need"
No," , let 's say your diagnosis is lung cancer , but you start bleeding from the stomach that is not related to hospice diagnosis . Um . What happened ? They usually take away the service of hospice and they will"
No," come . They will come and monitor you educate you , the family , they will bring tons of medical equipment , and hospice is great about that . They will bring you hospital bed oxygen ."
No," If you need , if you need bedside commode , if you need crutches , if you need mobility devices , they will bring all that to you and part of the understanding about hospice . Is it 's more a financial decision uh ? Otherwise , you will get the care from"
No," place . It can be at home , it can be a nursing home , they will take care of these services for you and then having a home health aid . So this is very important and it happens when we 're talking about caregiver"
No," burnout , home health aid . Their job is to take care of your personal need , and it 's about a person 's dignity too . Your your mom or dad is on a deck bed , but still need to have bathing . You know you 're you 're"
No," um . The next one is brief , men 's support for family and the caregiver , so this is something that they will offer to family and patient , and the bereavement service will continue uh , usually up to six months after"
No," you lose your family member . So after the person die , your patient died , they will still come back and keep checking on you how you 're doing uh technical uh by definition the grieving , is up to a year after six months they"
No," uh . When the caregiver is completely overwhelmed . Let 'S say you are taking care of your mom . It 'S very very sick , but then something come up . You have to leave your mom you 're traveling outside , so the respite care is"
No, temporarily . You will transfer your mom to a nursing home um . Without any you know any illness that happened without any admitting criteria . They will provide care for a few days for you and you will be qualified . Let 'S say five
No," days , every 30 days um and this is to help with the caregiver and then there are hospice services in the hospital as well . Let 'S say if somebody have uh bad nausea and not able to control"
No," somebody 's in tremendous pain that they need iv , medication or some other criteria . Hospice will take care of you in the hospital . There are certain nursing home . They will do a kind of like a scenario like impatient hospice"
No," going through an applied care with his family member . So this book is very famous uh . You know if you want to read about uh this book called being mortal . He also read another book called when , when breath become air"
No," , there 's also a very good book to me , and this is linked for uh caregivers . So let 's say we 're talking about caregiver stress . If you are looking for your loved one , that needs dementia support group or looking for meals on the wheel or"
Environment," provide free meals and then also do the exercise some memory games , so the senior resource center do a really really good job . So , if you 're looking for any resources locally , so you go to this website . You pro your zip code"
No," and you will see all the services listed there , and this is some something that government has put together for us , so some resources for caregivers . So now we are ready for questions . If we have any more ."
No," care , um and insurance . I just i was n't clear : is it usually not covered by insurance that you have to pay out of pocket , or is this something that most insurances do cover most of the uh pretty much ? Every single"
No," insurance will cover hospice and and what happened so it 's kind of was i what i meant to say it 's kind of financial decision . In a way when you choose hospice , you turn all your medical benefit into hospice"
No," , um and and then it becomes not on patient part , but on reimbursement part that how things are gon na uh work , your your insurance is paying most of it to the hospice services And the primary care physician you still get to see a primary care physician"
No," So it 's just like your hospital or your insurance turn into hospice , but uh uh everything stays the same on patient part got it . Thank you and one more thing . I know when we were uh planning this one of the things that did come up was"
No," uh palliative care or hospice care for children . Um . If you know of anything like that here , because i know we always think of it with our elders or adults when they 're"
No," at the end of life , you know that that 's an option but is does this also exist for children , because you know , sadly , we see a Lot of children having to to go through this absolutely there are"
No," services for kids as well hospice services for kids , and i think somebody who uh like a family , physician uh like me , who has a background taking care of kids and then has a specialization in . I have more geriatric , but if i had additional"
No," think in mind as a muslim . I i should not quit fighting i 'm gon na fight as much as i can till till the end , but there 's a time when it becomes too much and we have to realize the disease is taking over . I did my best , but the disease"
No," course is is , is gon na . Take me to the end . So this is the time you sign up for hospice and if a child is at that stage , we just have to be more aware about . You know what 's what 's coming up next and have realistic expectation , um"
No, and uh . Inshallah . We do want to open up our doors again and continue programs like this . If there are some other issues around your health and wellness that you are interested in learning more about .
No," take some notes and share it with your friends , because i know this Is such good information and we 're so grateful to have a resource like you in the community ? Thank you for zana , for helping put this"
Environment," Welcome to the final section of topic be in the exam universe , social care unit 1 . Now what we 're doing a session with a look at b6 , which is factors affecting human growth and development and we 're gon na go through this in a very short session . Just to explain the key"
No," , for most people we can expect that we 're gon na go to school . We can generally expect that we 're gon na move out of their parents house , where generally gon na expect that we can get a job that will retire one day that we might have a family around . These are predictable"
Environment," may not expect . These are unpredictable . These these happen without much planning that prep . The current Korona climate is a good example unpredictable event . We know work has changed , life has changed , routines have changed so unpredictable events are ones that we can not predict"
No," are so , the first one we have the first one . We have a starting school or nursery now . This is a predictable life and we know at some point we 're gon na start school . Now that the the change that takes place is that we have to learn to make new friends , we have to cope with"
Environment," spending a day in a new environment . Imagine a little fiveyearold starting school for the first time , having spent the first five years of life at home with moms and dads so um , it 's a predictable change . We know it 's gon na happen , but you"
No," can feel unsafe if you feel withdrawn from others , you might lose support from your parents . You might find it hard to make friends . So starting school can be a challenge . Second , one is changing and beginning employment . So again , we all know as"
Environment," sample and we 're gon na get job . But what is tricky with this is choosing a work role and having an income , and people might feel pressured by the demands of time on mental energy , finding it difficult to adapt to the new routine to losing a load they 're sort of their"
Environment," , so we achieve independence , we begin to control our personal environment and we begin to be able to you know it helps us to cope with a new situation . We feel pressured by new tasks . You move into a new home . You live by yourself . You then become responsible for paying the bills"
Environment," leaving prison . So if you 've been in prison , you get to leave and what that can do is also that 's really great . You get freedom , you 've got choice , you 're , you 're , free or a prison , but you lose your routine . You may lose your structured environment . You have lost all"
Environment," your support , whether that 's official support for the prison . It can be artificial support through friends in prison . There can be issues with finding that in sorry found in house in gaining the income coping with discrimination , so there 's lots of negative impacts of"
No," loss of Independence . These can be possible sources of stress . Then we have parent errs so again having children , you build more attachment . You learn new parents and skills . Your role , changes that can will be positive and stressful , but some of the problems are coming . This"
No," is disruption to previous lifestyle . You lose all , if not most , of your free time . You get new demands on time and energy you 're , always feeling tired . You do n't have as much money again as a relatively new parent . I mix , whereas a lolly so again that there 's a whole new range of"
No," of these we 've all experienced our lifetime . Obviously I know this will again just what we 're here . You know , marriage and Parenthood , you know people can choose , you know they do n't want to get married , they do n't want to have children , so they may not have to deal"
No," sibling . Now I know you 're thinking or how 'd . You not know that you 're gon na have a baby now that again , as an adult having a child and Parenthood is a predictable event . As we 've seen on the previous slide , this unpredictable one is more to children , so children would"
No," attachments . Now this is positive , but it can cause jealousy . Rivalry lead to emotional tension , because the changes in the roles of the family , older children or the older child might lose attention from parents , and that can be a source of stress for them : redundancies . The next"
Environment," one , the lists so again , that 's that 's Lulu 's your job without much involvement or twist , so losing you up there . You 'D have to learn to adapt to a new level of income , changes your lifestyle . Now the stress and negative stress that come with this is refusal to accept change ."
No," You might be angry , you could face depression , you could fade sort of students , failure to cope with the change and again the done season unpredictable , because it 's one that you do n't have much control in it or say in it . It 'S kind of put upon you : now we have serious"
Environment," illness , so this could be or see you you might learn to adapt so that you might learn to change the way you 're working or living or your environment , and that could be positive , but the problems you know you can face again . Anger , depression , failure to adapt to a"
No," disability or an illness or a change in your circumstances , grief in summers basically felt you know you no longer are healthy or in good health . So you could fear your experience of grief . So there are lots of negative impacts of this . You have divorce so again learning"
No," to cope with a new lifestyle . Again , if you separate from your partner now that can lead to resentment , it can lead to depression grief . The relationship falling apart . Failure to adapt to a new lifestyle , a possible financial hardship . These can be all some other problems"
No," with divorce and the image here on the screen . I 'M particularly want to focus on it because of Scott here . So , while we 're talking about divorce in a in a general sense children , so you know there are negative impacts of stress impasse of the laws on all"
No," members of the family , not just they had all too involved , and last but not least , we have bereavement . Now bereavement is Susie again the death loss of a partner so again learning to cope the loss of someone , a new lifestyle or new way of life . You know if you live for something"
No," for a long period of time and you 've got very established routine and lifestyle , and you know relationship and dynamic of the family to lose . Someone would change that quite significantly , so again , failure to adapt a new lifestyle that could be a source of"
No, potential stress and negative impacts of it all so thinking back again . The way this all connects know the emotional attachment connection . Your resilience might be loss if your main source of support has vanished died . So these are unpredictable life events .
No," hopes to gain access to see his son upon his release . He has nowhere to live and is currently studying . I started staying on his friends sofa his friend is also a drug dealer . Now again , that 's not a predictable unpredictable life then , but does kind of hint that he could be drawn"
No," stress , but some of the ones that we can potentially plan for others ones . We can not expect okay , so that makes sense . Hopefully , okay , here 's our second case study keratin , so this is Holly . Now all he 's four years old , his family recently moved it to a"
No," new town and he 's due to start learning a new school . So in terms of predictable life events , we 've got a new school Tenchi . Moving house moving out is a predictable . I mean in some respects II know we pretend you know , as some probably may not live in the same house"
No," again . They would know they are having a baby . So that 's predictable for the parents , but was even thinking focusing more on Ollie here . So this would be an unpredictable for him . He does n't know or did n't , have any input or involvement in this , so it 's an unpredictable to them"
No," isolated with both friends and family that can potentially come under that unpredictable . You know you do n't plan to predict that you 'll be isolated from family and friends . So again , lots of elements in here that could be source of stress of a moving house , as we mentioned"
No," energy foods or picking on chocolate , and that could be linked to other elements like a tired or kind of looking For some sort of pleasure or joy , so kind of balance of stress , it can also lead to under 18 . You completely lose your appetite if you"
No," leads us excessive smoking or drinking again as coping mechanisms of trying to calm yourself down or respond to a stress as per upon you , you can lead to sleep deprivation , so lost sleep motivations . Also again , if you , if you do n't sleep , you less energy , less focus"
No," less driving , you can lose motivation , you can be argumentative or irritable . So again you may be shorttempered and not really willing to talk to people negotiate things and , lastly , it can lead to anxiety attacks . You have panic attacks , stress attacks because of that"
No," bowel problems . Stomach upset , probably the thymus damage I can find for stomach issues . It can lead to tension , headaches , migraines muscle , pain . So again , stress can manifest itself in lots of physical ways . It can lead to a loss of sex drive . So again you know your"
No," separation , prison death of a family member injury , marriage be fired at work , so there 's a lot of here at the top and again , if He was scroll for the list . You would think about what have affected you and I 'm just skimming through myself and I 'm not seeing change different"
Environment," Lightwood changes to work . Maybe the current Crona climate would have an impact I 'll give to spouses . We'Ve got a troll remortgage change . I'Ve changed mortgage , so major chef got new responsibilities of work , change so again , you 'd skip through the list and think"
No," about what has happened to us most of these , I 'm quite an uneventful life , really not much going on change . Your sleeping on getting less sleep with a toddler per house remember : eating habits , change in well , been locked out . I'Ve been eating quite unhelpfully"
No," even be an easy thing to do . Is while you 're at home maybe go , and you know how would you explain this to your mom , your dad and your brother or whoever you live with it , though , and how would you explain the homes are a very adjustment rating scale to them and I think about How"
Environment," you 'd explain it and pop back into your packs final part of this lesson , so you 've got an assessment . Now there is an assessment at the very end of your pack . Now I realize that this current climate with these sounds being canceled . This is a slightly it does feel slightly"
No," thinking about it in that way , so we 've got Mary mario 's , our Shire only child . So that 's one thing : we 've got only child , so low support network thinking about Bambi attachment and had a very small friendship circle . Again , that 's support network she experienced"
No," , so that would definitely be one of those sources of stress . So we know her . Selfimage and selfesteem has been affected by the boolean . She was close to her mother and was devastated when she died . Remembers . 18 , so that 's no death of a"
No," family member , particularly of a parent . She was married 21 sigh , some predictable life of ender to be when they have free assurance at Parenthood . Another predictable life event : it was a paramedic and most different shifts every week . So that 's"
No," that could be a source of stressed out that in predictability , one predictable working pan . She was a nursing home manager , but had to give up her job to look after children . So that 's a source of stress as well , losing your role , your responsibilities and I 'll see the"
No," financial change that would have come with it . She disappoint to leave her job . She had this job , it gave her selfesteem a boost , so we know that 's . Gon na have taken a dive again and as that she 'll got older . She took on a parttime job as an occupational therapist so again"
No," Bill how having financial money and marital difficulties , financial marital difficulties bill was spending not eliza way . Divorce is taking place , selling the house again , another source of stress always daughter , leaving soon so I 've got a child leaving so the empty nest"
No," syndrome . A kick in Mary start to drink she 's , not sleeping she 's got weight was a poor diet and I exercising her friendship with you . Circles were juiced even more because of a lifestyle . She was drawn a depressed and I stopped taking care of her appearance and personal"
No," loads in there . We just flagged up , but you know , predictable life events would be Parenthood . Marriage getting a job , you know , maybe career change . Unpredictable would be . Divorce would be , I suppose , depression , the bullying . These are the unpredictable life events to"
No," factors that can have an influence of marriage development . Well , there 's lots in here , so her selfesteem was being mentioned , a bullying the death of her mother . The I see the children leaving home going to university under stress is a"
No," home bones : ray readjustment scale , so there should be a hey Janice , but either way , hopefully scratching your back , but the homes are a regional scale . So again , there 's a lot of discussions , their relation to self development , self esteem , the stress factors , the things that would"
No," have a look at those as well . Otherwise , thank you for watching . I hope this been helped and if you know how many questions just speak , your teacher , okay , thanks again take care."
No," runs rampant in my family . So what happened is i was in and out of the hospital constantly , and i got to tell you something when you 're in the hospital that much it gets boring . You can only watch so many prices write reruns . You can only sit there and read"
No," had some sort of heart surgery and the nurse said well , are n't you excited you 're getting out of here ? It 'S like i 'm really excited . She goes . What are you going to do ? I 'M going to take my wife out to dinner . She goes that 's fantastic . Where are you"
No," going to take your wife ? Oh we 're going to go to mcdonald 's . Your wife is going to be pissed you 're going to mcdonald 's , oh my goodness ! So i 'm like , i ca n't believe he just said this . How is the nurse going to respond to this"
Environment," But i was that was not a good thing for me to do it 's a very bad attitude , because my background is in health and exercise science . These people do n't know better and when i go back and think about his response - and he said , do n't worry , i 'm gon na get that fish sandwich ."
Environment," to make sure they understand the simple aspects of nutrition and exercise and how they can Change our lives . Listen . I want to change a lot of lives with 315 plus million people in the us . That 'S a lot what 's interesting , 117 million of those people"
Environment," nutrition and exercise every single day . We see it on social media output , friends to dinner . We talk about it , news , magazines , whatever it may be , we hear about what 's right , what 's wrong , etc , and then you have all the experts all"
Environment," right . I put that lightly experts . Okay . Ultimately , these experts are pushing supplements , they 're , pushing extreme ways to exercise etc , often they 're , making things more difficult and"
No," and we learned the same punches . The same kicks the same footwork . I learned a lot from him . It carried over into me learning those skills , the rest of my life and holding on to them . Now a lot of the others instructors . I came across basically the first day we 're going to"
No," best cereal on the face you see where i 'm going . We can keep this pretty simple , but unfortunately , what makes nutrition specifically so hard to understand so hard to grasp is the diet out there ."
No," Everyone at one point in their life has been on a diet and , unfortunately , diets make things difficult . Diet is like religion . Nowadays , you see something about diet , on social media every single day on the news every single day - and i hate to admit this , but they work"
No," diet because they create boundaries . You ca n't eat certain foods . So when you have ice cream , you have failed . Your diet , you 've stepped outside that boundary and that beats you up see and what happens is you do it again and you do it again"
No," to the point where you 're not following that diet and maybe some of the good nutritional principles that diet has and still so That 'S why we yoyos so much , but let 's look at just some essential nutritional habits that we can instill"
No," at the end of the aisle at supermarket . We have to limit them . There 'S no nutritional value to this stuff . All right , i 'm not saying completely get rid of it because listen , my family 's from northeast philly . If you told me that i had to stop eating cheesesteaks you 're"
No," nuts , cheesesteaks and hoagies are a food group in my family . All right with that said , let 's just use that old principle of moderation . Let 'S limit these foods and then maybe one day yeah , you might want to emit them from your nutritional habits , but again we 're all"
No," this idea , we 're thinking outside the box you 're walking at work , but if you ever watch these treadmills , i kid you not . This is how fast the people are walking all right . That 'S not doing much for you if you ca n't fit in 10 minutes in the morning 10 minutes a night without doing"
Environment," it , while you 're working , you 're booking yourself too tight it 's time to work on some time management , let alone basic nutrition and exercise all right get out . Move often now look that 's it . I told you the basic principles of nutrition and exercise very simple"
No," i 'm going through , i 'm seeing a lot of red flags . Okay , over 40 years old 50 pounds , overweight , lots of medication , high blood pressure , risk of cardiovascular disease , because it 's in his family and then i saw it i 'm like oh well"
No," I grew up with my identical twin, who was an incredibly loving brother. Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving."
No," When I became a psychologist, I began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value the body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people look at my business card and say, ""Oh a psychologist. So, not a real doctor,"" as if it should say that on my card."
No," Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist (Not a Real Doctor) This favoritism we show the body over the mind I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their fiveyearold was getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool by the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell."
No," He cried for a minute, but then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out for a box of BandAids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely tie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain our physical health"
No," and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since we were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth"
No," than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse if we ignore them, and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways."
No," It is time we closed the gap between our physical and our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which, my brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. We didn't study together, though."
No," In fact, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic to New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then for the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal for both of us. But while he remained among family and friends, I was alone in a new country."
No," I spent the morning pacing around my room, waiting for him to call and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, ""OK, he's out with friends, he'll call later."" There were no cell phones then."
No," But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out,"
No," because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching more than you can stand? I was in the grips of real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day, so it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined purely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you."
No," for your longterm health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings saying, ""This could kill you."" But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize our psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene."
No," Now, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something, and you believe it,"
No," I learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends down a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car, and shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me."
No," And his eyes opened wide and he said, ""Where have I seen your face before?"" And I said, ""In the front seat."" But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. So he drags me out of the car, he searches me,"
No," Stop Emotional Bleeding Our minds and our feelings they're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute, and really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman who, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce,"
No," ""I'm not interested,"" and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said: ""Well, what do you expect? You have big hips, you have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome, successful man like that"
No," ever go out with a loser like you?"" Shocking, right, that a friend could be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't the friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection."
No," We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were, what we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our selfesteem is already hurting. Why would we want to go and damage it even further?"
No," We wouldn't make a physical injury worse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm and decide, ""Oh! I know I'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it."" But we do that with psychological injuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize our psychological health. We know from dozens of studies that when your selfesteem is lower,"
No," you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected, the first thing you should be doing is to revive your selfesteem, not join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain,"
No, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. Protect Your SelfEsteem We have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you
No," or your professor makes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts,"
No," you are actually putting yourself at significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important,"
No," so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago, I developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed with stage 3 nonHodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy."
No," And I couldn't stop thinking about what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking about how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy, but psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do."
No," Studies tell us that even a twominute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment. And so each time I had a worrying, upsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed. And within one week, my whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. Battle Negative Thinking"
No," Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy, my brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side when he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely,"
No," by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your selfesteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal your psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began practicing personal hygiene,"
No, and life expectancy rates rose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing emotional hygiene. Can you imagine what the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness and less depression?
No," Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , veg 2022 , today we have lectures on another lectures on community Arafah , which we call half related quality of life . What is you consider as quality of life ? What is quality of life quality of life ? We can consider as a degree to which an"

No," viewing at our instagram . If you have any questions for this speaker , please use the chat feature in this zoom webinar or you can use your microphone to ask a question after this session and now i 'm glad to welcome our special"
Environment," you know , rehabilitation and quality of life , because that is very important and uh , but i other than that i will be covering other other small topics and all like you know , living with dementia and the stigma"
Environment," and before i Touch on rehabilitation , so a little bit of introduction about me before i introduce . Let me introduce the piece of and photography done by , a person living with dementia . His name is rob and rob is a person living with"
Environment," , whereby it is the first initiative of of adi to look into accreditations and so that training partners . Organizations like colleges , nursing college or anything"
Environment," that do give training on care , giving training will have a standardized , uh quality , high quality , dementia care and then i 'm also a member of whoa global dementia of the observatory , whereby i 'm on the focus group member , where we review"
Environment," dementia alliance umbrella is called the environment and dementia , because i believe that there is more needs to be done to the environment , because the environment affects the way person living with dementia experience . The condition"
Environment," so today , the topics that i will be covering will be on diagnosis and living with dementia stigma and impact . But my main focus of today 's topic will be on rehabilitation and quality of life , and then i will touch very lightly on the"
No," the french toast uh uh uh french sauce incident - uh , whereby you know is it some uh making french toast , is something that i have been making since my children were very , very small . But"
No," diagnosis of dementia rather difficult , because - and i was misdiagnosed luckily and first one is i - i was diagnosed with fatal familiar insomnia , because i do have the symptoms of not able to"
No," sleep and con what you call went uh . My sleep , my my my sleep situation was"
No," so he just what you call diagnosed me with what fatal familiar insomnia , which is also a form of a neurodegenerative disease yeah . So so then , after that time i was diagnosed with a"
No," young onset alzheimer and was on the medication also , but then the lumbar puncture come back and the mris can come back and show that i do n't have towels . I do n't have tangles and diet . Medications had to be removed gradually , so so"
No," uh one thing about young onsen is that young mama susan they diagnosed . We do n't have this not necessary . We will have memory issue . So bhagisaya is you know my executive function is , is dictoriating , it 's not good . So , for example , like planning multitasking , you"
No," know paying focus attention , focus and uh and flexibility . So so these are the things that um that is affecting me . It 'S not so much of my memory uh so"
No," but then most of the doctors are familiar with alzheimer 's and that is to do with memory . So if you do n't have memory , it is very hard for the doctor to to diagnose you and take you know"
No," , connective ability yeah . So the grief is there mama susan , for we young onset to uh for to to say to us to uh , to accept that the diagnosis , because uh"
No," depression , yeah and then the postdiagnostic support the pds services is not jailed to support people living with young onset , dementia and all the communities . Services is also"
No," not suitable because it cater more for the senior with dementia . So there is a big gap in the psd services and then uh until uh family , of course , is a huge uh blow to the family and uh . Also , a lot of"
No," adjustment need to be met , and now there is no certain things that i used to do like i 'm my time into a finance minister of the family . I can not do that and my family , my younger daughter , had no"
No," , progressive enough and lifelimiting condition . So , as a person living with dementia , you really need to find your courage and then find hope again and uh have to look like in a in a new perspective and get"
No," that really shakes the confidence Of the person , and also the selfworth and selfesteem , so many people who are not of strong character . Unlike those these three that was featured in this video , they are very"
No," will let their family members or everybody to to decide for them to do things for them , and this is create that assess this ability . That has nothing to do with the dementia condition . As per saying so like what i said , my focus today is to"
Environment," talk about rehabilitation , and why i want to talk about rehabilitation . Is that when we talk about the quality of life for people living with dementia , most of the time is that um"
Environment," care , giving for their loved one and also by healthcare . Professional , so rehabilitation is uh is something that is very important , because we know that a key"
Environment, features of living with dementia is the functional decline in our ability . So rehabilitation is one one way of what you call getting us to
No," to be able to do things again and to mankato and dementia their own home and in their own community , and then you also"
Environment," with rehabilitation when this plan is done . It also helps to reduce the the chance of rehospitalization and promote that independence . So , but one thing that you need to understand is"
Environment," that with rehabilitation is unlike the traditional rehabilitations , that you understood , whereby people are able to go back to their formal stage of performance . But when it 's coming to dementia , because it 's a declining function , functioning ability and with"
Environment," like you know we finding characterized swatu by passing the deficit and impairment , so that is what rehabilitation for orlando dementia is about . It is never about going back and be at"
Environment," , whether is it vascular , dementia level body , dementia , frontal temporal dementia and all The other types of dementia yeah so now the rehabilitation is uh"
No," , communication , everyday living activities , mobility and fiscal function . So um , i was taught to share this one for a while and because the slide will be the same , and i just want to talk to you"
Environment," connection . For a longer time , that is where you need to provide these cognitive rehabilitation now connective rehabilitations have two type and one type that is very commonly used and now throughout all dimensional center . In all dementia , okay is cognitive"
Environment," so , but there is two aspects of of connective rehabilitation that is seriously lacking and one one of them is called the reality orientation Whereby we tend to forget that people living with dementia"
Environment, important . That is something that uh we we we need to to have and uh so but uh . The other things that i i like to talk about is the the connective rehabilitation in terms of functional ability like to be able to continue to do things
Environment," for yourself like , for example , i , sugar , massage and baking . So when my neurologist advised me for safety reason not to cook but to go for food catering or and have someone come over to cook for the family"
Environment," , coming to cognitive rehabilitation , you can not engage occupational therapy to to do it together with the person living with dementia . But not everybody can access to occupational therapy mala is very expensive to to"
Environment," i i translate her project into something to help myself to maintain my functional ability , and that means that i can still Do cooking and baking safely and i can go and take public transport on my own and"
No," learn uh things that i will not be able to like . When i was newly diagnosed , i was having struggle with reading foreign . My working memory is not good , so"
Environment," these are the things . What we call is connective rehabilitation and it is very person centered , whereby the person will the person who is living with dementia get to say"
Environment," part of the connective rehabilitation therapy is , it has to be intrinsically motivated from the person want to do It so that they will always continue to do because it requires that repeated action of doing it until the person is"
No," have to find ways of how to support the person , so the person can continue to have conversations with you , and some of the things that you can do is that you know for for Uh , to have a conversation is , you know , have a memory book"
No," , for The uh mobility and physical function , then you will have to focus on . If how do you prevent the fall in the person and also balance is very important , and how do you keep"
Environment," so and then the physical exercise is not just about walking , but it has to be a mix of exercise . You know , like aerobic strength , exercise coordination , exercise that is very important ."
Environment," Everyday life activity , uh , put in place all the assistive technology and all and then like uh what you call visual cues in the environment , laboring and simplified the tasks . Those are very important to enable odd to continue to"
Environment," be able to do things and then functional exercise that is very helpful for everyday living activity . Functional exercises do the exercise that is similar to how you will do your daily activity like , for example , you lift want to carry something like"
Environment, that as postural changes and lifting the thing is is called a functional exercise . So next i will just touch lightly . On the united nation of people
Environment," person living with dementia , so for my advocacy work , this is my mission and i focus a lot on dementia education like what just now i say , a material made by people living with dementia to to breast awareness of dementia . Supporting others"
No," diagnosed with dementia . How do you go around it and then the community , their support is , is an ongoing thing and where i work with organize community partners , including ministry of health and other ngos also"
No, I hope you all enjoyed this amazing presentation now . Emily will answer some questions that were sent to us during the talk . So the first question is emily : what is your advice to our youth today when they experience young onset
No," within their family circle and way of supporting them on daytoday life ? Okay , there 's a good question : now : if you do have family members that is diagnosed already with young onset , then you try your best to put in place . What are the"
No," it done in brunei , but all over the world is that if you are senior , then you have more opening to go and see what you call uh to be to get your diagnosis , because you have memory clinic , you have a generation and then"
Environment, yeah . Next question : for the cognitive rehabilitation session example : goal of baking or cooking : can you share what it involved ? Duration ? What is in each session ? I see okay . This is something that i i
Environment," that in so that is roughly an idea of connective rehabilitation , but it has to be continue on . It takes a long time for the brain to rewire the way it is to be done because normally guitar can , when you"
Environment," uh , because uh i i use bus and i use mrt , and i we during the when you come to bus , interchange or mrt interchange . I do get confused because there are many people around and when there is lots of noise and many people and all the"
No," Yeah so and then become disoriented and then anxiety . Yes , but that did n't stop me , because my family have full confidence that i believe what"
No," I i so as the my family members , like the liverpool america hey , i i still need lost that much money now get back to the house or to a destination , but normally so what i do is my my anna will go through the direction with me , but Bus to attack , and then we will take a photo of"
No," daily activities for caregivers other than having a visible calendar of song , so you start with your incorporate into your daily routine like uh like morning ma , then you just uh say that oh uh , you asked the person living with dementia"
No," um ? Another question : uh apologies if this feels quite personal , but what keeps you going , how to find courage and new purpose in life and maybe share your hope for the community when it comes to knowing dementia"
No," You know that i no longer able to do things that i want to do , because i am a special needs , uh learning advisor and i thought what it do , and that is very , very difficult for me and and then"
No," that i need to count on my family Members uh , like i share you early i 'll share with you earlier i i 'm a book reader . I love to read , and i find myself can not read enough so"
No," appoint that children . I will step up and i will share my story and then help other people newly diagnosed with dementia , to find that coverage , because courage can not be found when the person living with dementia is not"
No," and motivation . So i hope that you know , through this sharing uh in in brunei , you will have ogd , which are able to come forward and step up and start to do the sharing , because that is very powerful"
No, to to to aesthetic so do n't push it on . Try to find out what is that person feeling ? Why is that person feeling so difficult about it ? Is it because the person feels very scared ? Most of the time is get like done .
No, You know to think about you . You one day will not be able to do things for yourself to lost the independent to lost that ability . So that is that that fear is the greatest one . So do n't push that person to accept the diagnosis but help that person to
No," overcome that fear by helping him to see how he or she helped himself that 's the best way . So when that person is able to start to do thing again , he said that okay , not so scary la you know , i must say"
No," volleyball thing , although i 'm not able to do what i used to do , but i still can do many things . You know yeah and then they will start to see . Other hope believe other hope ."
No," The person will not deny that he or she is diagnosed with dementia , the top and because of the lack of heart and the fear of knowing that one day you will be totally dependent on people that makes it very difficult for people to accept"
No," , thank you for having me here , and i hope that you have picked up something , and i do really hope that you know uh with maya with you people and now you can get to uh . Have people living with the manchester odd to stand up to do the advocacy together with you , because you"
No," , yeah . Thank you again , emily for a very inspiring talk . Welcome i 'm very happy to to hear that yeah uh . It was a pleasure to have you with us emily . Thank you all for attending . We hope you"
Environment," today to have this last webinar of the series . Sleep disturbances and fatigue the role of neuro rehabilitation specialists , and we are very delighted to have dr L , Hamish Sherman and the assistant professor in physical therapy program at Jordan , University of Science"
Environment," and Technology . We also so delighted to have dr nice at EE , the assistant professor on the department with physiotherapy , in the school of rehabilitation sciences in the University of Jordan . We will start right now . If you have questions , please write"
No," it down in the chat area . So thank you for attending and , let 's start a thank you , dr nazar , for hosting our presentation and your introduction and as dr nozanne mentioned , our topic for this presentation is about two important factors : sleep , disturbances and fatigue ."
Environment," And what is your role as neural rehabilitation ? Specialists ? I'Ll ? Be presenting and I 'm an assistant professor in the physical therapy department , at the school of rehabilitation sciences at the University of Jordan and this"
Environment, It 'S really our pleasure today to be here me and dr Mayes and for know me again . Dr Mohammed present us my name is al Homme and Sherman . I am an assistant professor in the physical therapy department of rehabilitation sciences at
Environment," just University , and it 's really pleasure today to present about our topic today , which is the role of sheep disturbances and fatigue , highlighting the role of rehabilitation , especially and , as you know , during our rehabilitation Session PT and ot planned activity focused"
Environment," intervention that emphasized the need for practice and repetition of of motor action and that be in challenging environment . Therefore , physical , therapists and occupational therapists frequently spend a large portion of their treatment session teaching"
No," patients how to perform these tasks in order to improve a giving impairment and to increase the independence of their daily living . Therefore , we believe that focusing on an understanding or exploring factors that are important for motor learning for enhancing the way the"
Environment," patient learn from us . That motor to us is very important and if your powerlessness and you might see yourself in the clinic and rehabilitation clinic , we usually mostly focus on the motor impairment of of the task . So usually we focus on the motor aspect"
Environment," of any impairment . However , without any intention , we ignore the non motor aspect . However , over the past decade , a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that nonmotor factor are also important for motor learning and rehabilitation specialists . Here"
Environment," our presentation me and dr minds will highlight two important factors that are seed , disturbances and fatigue . Therefore , the focus of this course will will be to provide an early education specialist , with the practical knowledge about the importance of assessing and addressing"
Environment," the sleep issues and fatigue in their vision . The , and also we are will try to cover a review of literature on wine . Heat and fatigue are very important component of promotion , rehabilitation and Prevention , so that our presentation will cover the following topics . We will"
No," try to cover an overview about the seed , also important of a sip for our body function . We will mention and highlight services among people with various analogical condition , which is very important . We will shift our thinking after that into fatigue and we will do"
No," the same overview about fatigue , prevalence of fatigue among the neurological condition . Then we will come to the most important thing : how to assess sleep and manage the sleep and how to assess , fatigue and manage fatigue , and here we go . We will start with sleep"
No," , we all love the sleep . We all need to sleep , we all fight . Firstly , it is a basic human need for survival and based on the pattern of mystical activity in the brain measures using petrol in serum eye movement , measured using in each of kilogram and muscle tone measured using"
No," leakage from my ography . Sleep has been defined by for behavioral behaviour . These are the juice motor activity . So during sleep there is no motor activities , there 's a decreased response to stimulation and stereotyping posture . Usually it 's a lying down and supine"
No," position . Also the last the last feature : is it feed , as it is actively easy to be Perceval supposed to be ? We can get easy to awake state , and this is very important to differentiate that from other playing states such as comma was also . Sleep can not be considered as a"
No," homogeneous state . Instead , it has been a broadly divided into two different stages and named according to its main distinctive feature . The first phase is called nonrapid eye movement and usually we say non REM , sleep and , according to the recent American Academy"
No," of Sleep , Medicine scoring manual nonrem , sleep divided also into three characteristics of stages and that corresponding to increasing the depth of a scheme . Where is the stage one ? It 'S about the transition from wakefulness into asleep , and it 's correspond to like"
Environment," to see where we start the in and out from our surrounding environment . Usually we start to have hallucination in this stage stage . Two . It consists of plane waves , specifically sleep , spindles and key complexes , and as the seed jibon there is increase and slow wave sleep . I"
No," can , if you see person who is an REM , asleep or the disa stage , you feel that he is awake because he has a lot Of eye blinking - and i want you to see here - that brain activity during REM , sleep and during the awake period , as you can see here , there is a comparable activity"
No," , what 's going on in the sleeve , what 's the function of sleep to be act for the plan to be active as much As away steam , so a lot of the questions come to our mind when we think about asleep so during the night of young adults have a specific pattern ."
No," Obviously the stages young adults in tersely by through non REM , sleep and that followed by REM , sleep . So usually , we started from stage one stage , two and slowwave sleep and then room asleep . I 'M going back to stage two . If you go back to stage one . This is a bad thing , because"
No," it 's a shallow sleep , you feel you wake up a platform , and so the figures show we go . Let me sleep stage , one two and slow wave sleep and then REM sleep . These stages alternate in a cyclic manner , every 90 to 110 minutes , and these cycles have been for the sixth time . If you do"
No," simple calculation , you can guess the perfect skip timing . You need to get every night to have good sleep equality . Now we will talk about this in a minute in a moment . Also , the interesting thing about the sleep is that the ratio between non REM , sleep and REM , asleep"
No," change during sleep where you will have during the first half of the night of your sleep , is slow , wave asleep . And if you remember , if you are focused in this presentation , as I mentioned , though the deepest sleep where you can really feel you 're better deep sleep . So this"
No, happened during the first night of the first 34 hours of your sleep on the second right . The stages that are prevalent are stage two and REM sleep and again I want you to remember that REM . Sleep is a stage where the plane activity is
No," increased . So it 's something interesting about asleep , also studies or try to understand the plane activity during the sleep . Functional brain imaging has been used in a human to characterize the pattern of the screening activity that is associated with room and running a"
No," machine and , as you can see from these figures , REM and nonrem see there 's a differences , where 's pain as much at other red color . Much active during that I 'm asleep compared with anonymous . If so , it is a consistent finding that came up from bed and action . Mri is that always"
No," there is a reduction in a print activity during an enormous leap and that reduction of hairs of cortical cortical region , and that might explain the stretch of function of a sleep need for energy recovery . On the other hand , that 's also a different story ."
No," Better not appear activity as seriously are considerably different from non REM sleep . However , it 's not different from that pass urine associated with wakefulness , so many region increase their activity during REM , asleep , as I mentioned under"
No," the previous figure , the question how much sleep do I need do ? I need it 's from person to person different everybody try for more . However , it is different across the lifespan . But , however , their recommendation from the National Sleep Foundation is the"
No," , r79 go back to the calculation that I asked you to mean . I mentioned like 19 minutes of sleep stage , 4 time to 6 times . If you had played back , you will find like 7 to 9 hours appropriate to go through these cycles , all the nights , alright , the question"
No," again how many hours I need to sleep . The another confusing e question is : what 's the importance of sleep and asleep Ione researcher ? Who is dr Alan ? He once said : if asleep does n't serve an absolutely vital function , then it is the biggest mistake we ever made in our life from"
No," here . Researchers started to think about what about the function of the sleep that might have other than recovery . We all know that sleep with us have a energy recovery . However , it 's not enough for a big state that the Train have 7 to 9 hours , the whole life . So it 's hard to"
No," be right now searching about the function of sleep doctor . Mice will go through the most important function that are linked to sleep for our body function . Doctor mice , yes , thank you . So , in speaking after the physiology of sleep as doctor - and I"
No," mentioned that dr Alan , which is who 's a pioneer in sleep research - said it 's a vital function . It 'S definitely a vital function because it has been shown that sleep plays a major role in the proper functioning of various body systems . When you think about sleep , it 's the time"
No," where your brain recharges itself , your body cells , repair themselves , and there will be a secretion of a lot of hormones that it triggers various for the systems and alarms your body that it 's time to go to sleep . The various body systems that are important"
No," for appropriate function because of sleep include the immune function and tissue healing pain , modulation . We see that sleep is important for cardiovascular health , for cognitive function and , most importantly , it has been shown that it is important for"
No," learning new skills . So if you look closely at each body function and see , what 's the role of sleep in it , if we look at immune function and tissue healing several studies that explored sleep , depravation has shown that those who are sleep"
No," deprived , meaning that they do not have enough sleep . They have changes in their immune response physiologically . The changes that can happen is an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines . Sometimes there is even an altered activation of stress systems"
No," body 's tissue healing mechanisms . So if you think about it in terms of your patients , especially if you see your patients having several injuries and those diseases that are , for example , autoimmune , definitely if they are sleep deprived , they will have problems with"
No," important and crucial to have a really good night 's sleep so to help you by the fight of cope in nineteen . It might not treat it , but it will definitely fight it when it comes to pain and sleep . Both of these factors have a reciprocal relationship , meaning that , for example , if"
No," your patient has deprived sleep or poor sleep quality , there will increase in terms of its sensitivity and intensity and vice versa . So if they have a lot of pain during the night , they will definitely will not have a good night 's week and eventually have"
No," poor sleep quality , and this relationship between these two factors is believed because they 're , both controlled by similar neural mechanisms , mainly through central serotonergic , neural Transmission now , if you look at the research done on pain , there has been a lot of evidence"
No," that links pain with poor sleep quality in conditions that have chronic pain , for example , patients with fibromyalgia , those with osteoarthritis low back pain , painful diabetic , peripheral neuropathy and definitely progressive Neurologic conditions , especially in the acute stage"
No," after an insult or an injury like , for example , traumatic , brain injury patients during the acute stage after they encountered a traumatic event . They would have a lot of thing that , unfortunately , will cause poor sleep quality too . So therefore , as you can see , sleep quality"
No," is very important in modulating pain , perception and definitely should be part of your assessment and your management plan when you want to treat pain in your patients . If we look at a cardiovascular health , most of the research done in this area"
No," focused on the effect of sleep duration on various cardiovascular diseases , whether it increases the risk or not , so they divided the sleep duration into either long or short . So when we say that somebody sleeps as long duration we 're talking about more than the recommended"
No," hours , eight to nine or even 10 hours per night , we will see that those that sleep , this long will have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases among their lives and Even increased risk , unfortunately , of mortality , the same applies for those that are short"
No," , sleepers or or usually sleep less than five to six hours per night . Those individuals will have an kriste risk of developing or even dying from various coronary heart diseases . Now the exact mechanisms behind . Why sleep quality effects ? Cardiovascular health is"
No," probably mostly unknown . However , different theories includes that probably the increased sympathetic , nervous system activation due to sleep depravation that causes fluctuations and variability in the heart rate and blood pressure might cause these unfortunate"
No," changes in somebody 's cardiovascular health , sometimes also the presence of other factors that might disrupt sleep and Also increase the risk of cardiovascular health , like psychological problems as the like depression and anxiety . Also , another important factor is"
No," the presence of a sleep disorder when somebody is diagnosed with a sleep disorder like , for example , obstructive sleep apnea . It definitely increases the risk of developing various cardiovascular diseases like ischemic heart disease , arrhythmias and even"
No, strokes . Another important factor that might be affected with sleep is the psychological wellbeing of individuals . We all know how a lot of chronic neurological conditions unfortunately suffer from psychological issues like depression and anxiety and fortunately
No," , if they do not sleep well as well , this will increase , because if you look physiologically at the mechanisms behind this , those who are sleepdeprived or even have General sleep disturbances have alterations in their regulations of neurotransmitters that are necessary for"
No," our emotional and psychological would being . There will be also hyper arousal of areas of the brain that are related to emotional regulation . In fact , 75 percent of people who are depressed have experienced symptoms of insomnia , which is a sleep disorder that we really touch"
No, base and following slides . Another important function that might be affected by by poor sleep quality and is actually relevant . A lot to neurorehabilitation is the cognitive function . Sleep disruption can definitely impact your patients ability to perform
Environment," cognitive functions that are necessary for various rehabilitative treatment plans . If you think about it as a PT or an OT , you incorporate a lot of treatments in your rehabilitation that requires the patient 's function of different cognitive domains . For example"
Environment," , which is the ones asking the ability , also to focus on pertinent Stimuli while dismissing important stimuli , so , for example , if you 're doing your session with your patient and a hospital setting where there is a lot of distracting surroundings and noise , you want your"
No, patient to focus with you . Also . The high cortical cognitive functions like problem solving decision making and goal directed tasks . So definitely we see that those who are sleep deprived will unfortunately have slowing of their responses . They might have an increased
Environment," tendency to make mistakes on attentional tasks and , unfortunately , it might also lead to a decline in auditory and visual spatial attention and working memory further affecting the let 's say , the rehabilitation process and even participation and therapy also another"
No," important factor that , unfortunately , Would be affected by having poor see . Quality is also a relevant factor in a near habilitation , which is motor skill learning . Several studies have explored the effect of sleep depravation and pushed the quality on the performance of"
No," different motor tasks , and those studies have found that those who are sleepdeprived will have , unfortunately , affect their learning in various tasks . Tasks as simple as finger tapping using computerbased tasks or even complex"
No," tasks and functional as walking and automating might also , unfortunately be affected by having perceived quality . Now dr l homme will highlight this point by discussing a recent published study on motor skill learning and its effect on sleep and then we 'll move on forward"
Environment," with this presentation , dr in ham . All right , thank you , so much so as dr mice mention in addition to the most important function that sleep have , we have a very important function that linked our profession to our rehabilitation session , which has motor"
No," skill learning . So studies have found that different motor tasks have been shown to benefit from sleep , to enhance learning , and that varies from symbols to the commode complex tasks such as functional tasks and before going into our research current research that"
No," trying to prove this idea . I would like to just review the formation of memory motor memory , how our play , inform motorists memory and , as you might know , memory formation appears to develop over time and severances stages . We start with encoding , fail the encoding stage or we"
No," formation of a memory , representation and the pain ? So it 's very important now from encoding . We go to the second stage , which is the consolidation stage , and we call it a flying . Motor learning and offline multiplayer or normally consolidated , refers to the conversion of memory"
No," traces from level c , where we can load them into permanent state survey . Mem states in the frame the third stage is called storage , where we keep our memory inside our opinion , and we can report back in the first 40 stage and we called for another use . So"
No," now , what 's the rule of sleep in this memory formation , motor memory formation , asleep , has been found to unpack each stage of procedural memory formation . However , the consolidation phase is the most throughly studied stage with regard to sleep . What most of the study has"
No," compared them ? Finding the beneficiary of rule of sleep on procedural memory , consolidation , and what does that mean ? So if you have a subject today , if you have a patient today and you practice with him a specific task , if this individual keep following the practice a motor"
No," starts , he will perform better on the task compared with individual who stay awake for similar period of time . So no practice during this period , however , there is improvement . This is what we called asleep dependent of flying motor learning . There is an enhancement for the"
No," practice , for the task performance happened during that sleeping time . This is have been improved and the young , older , adult and also tip has been shown to enhance motor learning and individual with the chronic stroke and individual with multiple sclerosis . Now again , we 're"
No," back to our figure . We proved our researcher proved that he was good for consolidation , and I recently conducted research and just Jordan University of Science and Technology . We recently found that is key , also enhance motor learning online , so he was imported for"
No," consolidation and our research also drew . That seems important for the encoding phase , which I believe it is very important phase for having a task motor learning . So we performed two different study who want to assess if asleep , impact or CV quality impact , the encoding"
No," function . We understand the sleep mode and , as we know , our presentation today to highlight what 's going in a neurological condition . So I in coming to slide , I will focus on sleep in neural condition and we know that sleep frequency enter sorry answered , visual with a neurological"
Environment," condition who are likely to receive rehabilitation services from us , such as a stroke , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease monster and TBI . So what is the quality of their ability to learn and potentially influence recovery and their overall"
No," the night and we can not maintain our sleep . They also have obstructive sleep apnea and have restless leg syndrome , which is an Allegiant feeling in the limbs . They it 's make . The patient need to move air gently and they have also narcolepsy , which is an excessive sleep"
No," regarding in Samina . Studies have shown that Victoria and depression are the main reason for this condition , and also John . This trip to see studies have found that it 's excessive daytime , sleepiness depression and again in Femina and fatigue first stroke most stroke movie ."
No," There is a sleep related to the breathing disturbances , specifically post in the in the acute stage of a stroke , most commonly obstructive sleep apnea . They also might have hyper tsamina , which is waking up more than 24 hours , excessive daytime"
No," sleepiness , and they also develop restless leg syndrome . For traumatic brain injury , 50 percent of TBI have some form of stiffness order and that , as the studies shown , link to other comorbid is better present . Mtbi such as depression and anxiety , pain and"
No," cognitive deficit , they might tap in Samina , which is most commonly diagnostic , see disordered . Hyper Samina obstructive sleep , apnea and again narcolepsy for Parkinson disease . Interestingly , 80 percent of those people have hip disorder , as in some in our obstructive"
No," sleep , apnea and restless leg syndrome . It is totally associated with their poor , the quality of life . It 'S increased their risk of falling impulsive behavior and lead to poor driving performance , so we talked about if you have a neurological disorder , how you sleep will change house"
No," the answer during their disease ? It 'S a secondary communication of the disease . However , it 's interesting it 's interesting ! Finding that even it might predispose a disease , what we mean by that , if you have a chronic and sufficiently sleep or if you have , for"
No," example , obstructive sleep apnea or in Femina diagnosed as a diagnosed disorder that might contribute to development of certain condition , neurological condition so Evidence suggests that poor sleep may play an important role in the accumulation of beta amyloid , what which"
No," has lead to development of Alzheimer 's disease ? Also , certain sleep disorder have been found to be associated with the development of Parkinson 's disease and other neurodegenerative disease . So it 's not only , it is a complication of having a neurological disease , it 's also people"
No, with having another neurological disorder . So now we know that important to sleep and we know how is it change or might lead to a neurological disorder ? I want you to keep this information in your mind and tell the nice finish here overview about 32 mice .
No," Thank you . So now we will shift our focus into a other important factors that affect neurorehabilitation of various neurological conditions , which is fatigue . Fatigue is considered a very complex symptom because it 's multifactorial in"
No," nature - and there are a lot of definitions out there in the literature that attempt to try to define fatigue , but the most common definition that you will find out there is that fatigue is a subjective . Lack of physical or mental energy perceived by an individual that"
No," interferes with their usual and desired activity , and I highlighted physical and mental because it is very important to emphasize that fatigue is not only the physical exhaustion that your patients might experience , but also there is an Important mental or a cognitive"
No," component that your patient will experience as it also described as an overwhelming sense of tiredness , a lack of energy and feelings of exhaustion , that 's not only again physical , but also cognitive or mental . Now , if we look at the prevalence of fatigue among various"
No," neurological conditions that you would typically see in your clinic , we see that it affects a lot of people with multiple sclerosis patients with stroke , Parkinson 's disease and traumatic brain injury patients . If we look at how the acute versus chronic fatigue as we see"
No," that it has not only acute meaning related to the insult or the time of the injury or time of diagnosis or or associated with a fatiguing tasks , when we define a cute , I mean new Occurring in the past six weeks , but also fatigue , unfortunately , can be a chronic condition"
No," that lasts longer than six weeks . So , if we look at the etiology of fatigue , what causes fatigue ? There are a lot of theories out there , because the exact cause of fatigue and neurological condition is unknown because it 's very complex and"
No," believe it 's a multidimensional phenomenon , so fatigue might be caused by various factors . So , for example , if we look at next place , dr Nam fatigue might be caused by environmental factors might caused by the underlying disease itself , so the disease processes"
No," might cause fatigue . Also , there are evidence , related peripheral control systems versus central control systems , and also environmental factors can cause fatigue , and I will explain a little bit more about these in a second . So if you look at the causes of fatigue , we can"
No," patients with MS causes might cause them fatigue . If you look at other factors that are considered primary , like endocrine factors , abnormalities and the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis and sometimes deficiencies and some growth hormones might causes , fatigue , also"
No," neurotransmitter dysregulation , like dopamine and in Parkinson 's disease patients . If you look at patients with stroke , the brain , lesion and the location of the brain region might be a factor that causes fatigue in these individuals . Low blood sugar , coma scores at the time"
No," of the traumatic brain injury also has been linked to increased prevalence of fatigue . In this population , and also if your patient have preexisting fatigue from other factors before is also a contributing factor that other classification is secondary , factors"
No," which are caused by the complications or the symptoms that accompanies the condition might increase fatigue . So the physical deconditioning that we see in neurological patients , depending on their if they have an increased disease"
No," severity or they are in the acute stage , for example , with a lot of pain with a lot of psychological problems like depression and anxiety and as you can see , I highlighted in red , sleep dysfunction or disturbances are an important factor that unfortunately"
No," causes fatigue in these individuals . Also , we can see that cognitive impairments like slowed information , processing , speed and difficulty in concentration and that 's highlighting the elemental component of fatigue , demographic factors like older age , being a female for"
No," example , and being unemployed . Our factors that have been shown that are highly associated with fatigue . The presence of other medical comorbidities like if the affair patient other than the neurological condition have , for example , hypertension , have diabetes , have a liver"
No," disease or a cancer . Patient will also have will increase the risk of developing fatigue and also lifestyle factors , including a high BMI . For example , meaning being obese , sometimes also there 's studies that shown vitamin D deficiency is also linked with increases"
No," prevalence of fatigue and various neurological conditions . Now , if we look closely at the impact of fatigue on on various neurological conditions , it definitely impact their performance on various activities of daily living . It has been even linked to reduced"
No," employment rates , reduce a social and psychosocial life because , basically they 're just simply tired to engage with social activities . It affects their mood , definitely also highlighting how it affects their sleep quality and eventually , their overall quality of life ."
Environment," It has been also associated with cognitive impairments and limitation and participation and very aspect , including therapy and in rehabilitation . So , overall it might increase their disability , it is associated with their poor with the poor"
No," , general health and , unfortunately , even might increase the rate of healthcare utilization . So now to in to talk a little bit in more detail about the prevalence and the characterization of fatigue and various neurological conditions . So if we look at"
No," their balance problems . They classify fatigue and a mass into two types . It 'S mainly either physical or motor , which is basically the muscle weakness . The slurred speech that they might have their inability because of the general weakness they have to perform daily"
No," tasks . The other factor is cognitive fatigue , which is basically their deterioration to perform various cognitive tasks for a long period of time , because basically they are mentally exhausted . So a cognitive function and cognitive fatigue and to relate a lot"
No," , but they are a little bit different constructs if we understand that already behind the two there are also other classifications of fatigue . In MS , there is the term we use called fatigability fatigue . Ability is the increased weakness that comes along with"
Environment," performing a task over a long period of time , so , for example , if they exercise for a long period of time or as the day progresses , we will have increased weakness and that 's the term fatigability . It also applies for a mental function , so if they perform , for"
No," So another important factors to mention regarding ms related fatigue is how distinctive it is compared to other conditions . What makes a mess related fatigue distinctive is that it occurs on a daily basis . It comes on easily and suddenly , so it is"
No," not again related to a fatiguing task . It can comes on even when they are at rest . Usually it worsens as the day progresses and a research have shown that ms related fatigue is worse in the afternoon compared to other times of the day . As you all know , MS individuals are"
No," sensitive to heat , so fatigue can be aggravated by heat and humidity . It is more severe compared to other conditions and , unfortunately , it interferes with their role , performance and overall physical functioning . If you look at evidence from a recent study , a recent"
No," published study by dr l homme , she looked at the motor performance improvement and and how fatigue effects that through a virtualreality task , and they have found that the motor performance of MS individuals on this virtual reality Success actually"
No," impacted by fatigue in a negative way , of course , so this definitely highlights the importance for health care professionals to be aware of the firm , the negative impact a fatigue can have on learning motor skills in these individuals . If you look at patients with stroke fatigue in"
No," the fatigue experienced and MS patients is that it does not change over time , but sometimes those who report fatigue at baseline show relatively high levels of fatigue over time , but generally it does not change . Unfortunately , it has been associated with an increased mortality"
No," rate for functional outcomes and neurological recovery , low quality of life and participation and therapy in these individuals . What makes a stroke fatigue also different is the onset and it 's time course we can classify fatigue of"
No," protective and restorative , because it helps to protect them from further injury , because they 're feeling tired and probably they will just need to rest so the risk of having other injuries Decrease , however , when it becomes chronic and persistent , this is where it 's"
No," pathological in nature and associated with complexity , ologies , primary post , stroke fatigue might be caused by attention and deficits that the patient go through in the specifically in the acute stage , due to interruption of various neural Networks like the"
No," reticular activating system , if you look at patients with traumatic brain injury here , the story is a little bit different . We all know that TBI patients go through complex and multifactorial symptoms , so fatigue in this population is morally subjective , as it includes"
No," not only physical and cognitive components , but we see that the motivation and the situation and an activity related components , effects and increases the prevalence of Fatigue in these individuals , many individuals with TBI actually tend to ignore the the"
No," symptoms of fatigue or even engage in compensatory strategies like , for example , spending extended times embed or having daytime napping or restricting participation and activities like a protective mechanism by ignoring this symptom , usually fatigue . In this"
No," population decreased in the first year following injury and remains unchanged in subsequent years , unless there are primary or sorry secondary , factors that accompanies the disease and and increase their fatigue . Usually fatigue in this population is"
No," related to situation and stress and selfreported semantic symptoms . If we look at Parkinson 's disease , also , fatigue is prevalent in this condition and it is mostly recognized as a non motor system , some time sorry and related to this disease severity and progression . So as"
No," the disease progresses and Parkinson 's disease patients , the more they will have fatigue , usually there are contributing factors in this . Population include , being elderly , have being a male having an anxiety , more motor symptoms . Having psychological problems like depression"
No," , the presence of sleep disorders further deteriorate their fatigue and even as a side effect of medications . The the reason or the etiology fatigue and Parkinson 's disease may be caused by mostly central factors or peripheral factors . We look at the"
No," altered activation of hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal systems due to the inflammatory process , and the stress that they go through central fatigue basically is linked to dopamine deficiency and can be even induced by decreased external stimulation by motor"
Environment," impairments . Peripheral fatigue , on the other hand , is as as the name implies mostly peripheral , affecting the muscles itself or physical or exercise fatigue . Sometimes they refer to it that gets provoked by doing exercise or doing any sort of an activity , as"
No," the patient will sense . This exhaustion by the repeated use of the muscles , either during any physical activity that they do so to summarize what we have just talked about me and doctor in Hamm . Definitely we have showed you that sleep disturbances and fatigue are prevalent"
Environment," therefore , there should be a focus by therapists on integrating sleep , health and wellness and health promotion interventions is warrant and managing fatigue definitely should be a critical component in the neuro rehabilitation film . So now dr l homme will take over"
Environment," and tell you about the sleep assessment and management . All right . Thank you . I hope nobody 's Kb yet because this is the important part how to assess a sleep now . Sleep assessment and fatigue assessment is very important , as we mentioned for rehabilitation specialists and before we"
No," start thinking about this topic , we asked ourselves a question : does it worth to do this presentation and do like a promotion or should that physical to have that knowledge ? We do n't know that , so we asked ourselves : do physical therapists and occupational therapists"
No," preliminary analysis for our result . For our survey , we found an interesting findings . We found that sixty two point , two agree and thirty : a percent strongly agree that they should ask your patient about their sleep habits and sleep quality . We found like around seventy"
No," agree and the 20 % strongly agree as that assistant . My patient , sleep habits and equality is important . 70 percent agree and an around 18 strongly agree that addressing sleep issues may impact physical therapy outcomes ."
Environment," However , only 11 percent respond Diaz to the question . Do you routinely assess your patients , sleep , habit or quality of sleep , so they on this percent 11 percent from the total people , and we believe that , because that is due to the lack of education about asleep , as 62 percent"
Environment," respond ? No , when we asked them , did you receive education in PT or ot school about the sleep and 85 percent respond ? No , when we asked them have you had education about sleep anywhere other than Petey 's for such as workshop , or course and 85 % respond ? I do n't know how"
No," , when I asked them , why do you want access you recline to sleep habit or equality of escape , so our pts and OTS know that asleep are is important , but they do n't know how to assess that . So that was the main reason behind doing such a presentation and only is your knowledge"
No, about secreting for common sleep disorder and how we can assess feed and little fatigue . So you know this . We know now . We know know that syllabus should read already assess overall sleep . How are n't sitting for common sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep
No," apnea , and we can start a line of assessment , but a therapist can start by asking patient generic question that should force the issue and assess general CV , quality and sleep health and the information that 's gathered From this question may also need the"
No," therapist to use the cleaning tools for further further screening for the common sleep disorders . So we create this generic question as a patient interview , we can start asking this question for our patient and if we feel the answer"
No," further announces further investigation , we will go on with further investigation . So we can ask our patient how much sleep do you typically get ? Do you feel well rested when you wake up in the morning ? Is your condition impacting your sleep ? Is it a mess ? Is it Viji that makes your"
No," sleep bad or is it something related to family issue or something some in your life newly in your life other than the disease ? So we can ask also , how would you raise your see ? The quality , poor or good , does being is key bit during the day"
No," , interfere with your daily function . While your reason gap up or while you are driving , do you feel sleepy ? Do you have difficulty falling asleep difficulty returning to sleep if you wake up in the middle of the night or difficulty with waking up too early ?"
No," This is a possible indicator for asleep in something if it 's lost more than three months . So if the answer yes , we can do further investigation and also we can ask the you snore loudly or frequently has anyone observed . You started breathing while you sleep , and this is a"
No," possible indicator for obstructive sleep apnea . So after finishing this question this we gather our information and if we feel that our patient is at rest of order , we can be fareham to finishing and we can do sixth inning using scheme to assess the"
No," risk of sleep disorders . Now we will give examples about the secreting cues that we might use an hour if your neck , it 's something easy to administer for our patient . First of all , we will talk about sips order , a screening tools such as , if"
No," sleep apnea , which is defined as recurrent episode of our way blockage during the sleep , which leads to decreased oxygen saturation and Increase in efforts to breathe , we can use a screening tool called stop . Bang , it was Junior which consists of a twoquestion"
No," translated and validated Arabic language , and , if any of you would like to have Them we will have you to provide you with these questionnaires . Now these questionnaire are called a subjective assessment of a sleep . So if we feel from the patient 's"
No," the answer that we need further analysis , we need more investigation , such as , if we feel really you our patient s of sleep apnea , we ca n't just stop here . We need to do objective assessment . We need to refer our patient to see the specialist to do an objective assessment : the gold"
No," standard assessment for Sweden ography , which is sleep study or the free blood study where the patients go to hospital or a bribe . It 'S a center or even hotel . That occupied by the scenography and it 's record playing waves , oxygen level and blood and heart rate under breathing ."
No," we need more than one night in sleep study now . Fortunately , we have a cheaper method to objectively assess asleep , which called actigraph or active watch . It 'S a portable device recall the movement over an extended period of time , usually used in extensive manner and"
No," that which gives us information about TV quality quantity , how many hours , if there is a similar and information about sleep Efficiency , though , during the night which give us insight about if syriza , fragmented or not so these are the objective objective and"
No," the subjective measures of asleep . So I start line of the questions . Then we move to the subsequent subjective assessment of fear loss . We feel we need advanced method of assessment . We refer to the objective assessment of sleep . So now we decided there 's there 's a problem , you"
Environment," see , so we need to move on to sleep management . We starts our line of management through sleep hygiene , education , so therapists should provide instruction about ways . Patients can optimize their health or their sleep health . That 'S the primary method to"
No," facilitate asleep health would be to educate patients about what is sleep , hygiene practices , and we have a set of instruction and examples about hygiene and how we can improve our CD quality . It might be logic for some of you . We usually ask our patient to go to sleep"
Environment, and wake up at the same time every day and we ask them not work or watch and the bed business for to sleep not for Jordi these activities . So we can do this activists outside the bedroom . Keep the bedroom for sleeping and avoid moderate to vigorous exercise at least two to
Environment," three hours before bedtime . Studies have shown that the best exercise timing to improve sleep quality during the morning time . However , if this is impossible for work circumstances , we can just give three two to three hours before going to bed time and , as you know , operate"
Environment," the first thing , which is education and sleep hygiene , and also we can have education about positioning for skip and addressing bed mobility , and a study had published by dr miles on 2017 . Give us like instruction or suggestion how patients can improve their sleep through"
No," the dead mobility and the position in the during the sleep . So a therapist should consider educating patients about appropriate position for sleep , considering the patient diagnosis , as well as addressing impaired mobility . If needed , we can educate our patient to"
Environment," sleep in a painfree opinion . The Jewess position that may lead to limit sleep disruption for our patients and we come up now for the third line of management , which has exercised a huge and the chronic exercise . Cuz , I 'm a direct positive benefit on sleep paralysis in"
Environment, healthy middleaged and older adult and also exercise have shown that exercise or a studies have shown that exercise significantly improve the sleep for people with a chronic insomnia and also a reason to study individual with a massive Artists addicted in moderate
Environment," intensity , aerobic exercise , program and low intensity walking and the stretching the broker program have shown imbrue the Equality . Also recently , we have published a study about the effect of aerobic exercise . Honestly , the quality measures and sleep related individual in an"
Environment," individual with multiple sclerosis . It was a randomized control trial . We asked our participant a participant to come to our clinic in just University and exercise three times a week for free , and we have found that exercise may be a non pharmacological and expensive and safe"
Environment," methods on relative equality and people with a mass . Also , we found interesting findings that might explain this mechanism that that make the CB quality imbrue . We found that after a little bit exercise let Tony Lee welcome Bruce . So there is"
Environment," improvement in certain level and if you remember this presentation victim , I said that one of the volume , biomarkers or mechanism that enhances CV quality as Sheila to me so exercise is very important to improve the quality . Another research that have been conducted and"
Environment," aim of the study was to look at the effect of stem cell therapies , specifically Amazon commercials and a combined exercise program on a variety of Symptoms , one of them was looking at this effect of therapy on sleep quality . This is just preliminary analysis on 36"
Environment," individuals , with an average age of 34 and mild disease severity . These individuals were randomized into one of three groups . The first group performed a six months combined exercise program . They specifically the exercise program , was a combination of aerobic training on"
Environment," a recombinant Stafford resistance exercises and a balanced training program , and it was a supervised six months at two times per week . The other group received only the stem cells or the mesenchymal injections , while the third group received both"
Environment," lines of therapy , the combined exercise and the mesenchymal cells , and I 'm just going to share with you this graph . We looked if equality using the Pittsburgh , which is the the assessment that dr Anne ham just talked about in a minute and as you"
Environment," can see , the exercise group has actually and also the other group that performed the combined therapy had positive , let 's say changes in their Sleep compared to the group that only received the mesenchymal injections . It is very early to draw conclusions , but it seems that"
Environment," exercise is playing some sort of a role and having those positive effects . The other results were on the airport sleep in a scale which measures daytime sleepiness and , as we can see , all three groups have actually improved six months after the baseline assessments . However"
Environment," , those who performed only the exercises seem to have the most positive benefits again . This is just preliminary , but those results are promising that I wanted to share with all of you . So other management interventions for sleep that have been shown to improve sleep quality"
No," might include some cognitive behavioral strategies and cognitive restructuring techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy , which is a psychosocial intervention that aims to improve mental health and help to treat problems like sleep , increasing coping skills , Stress"
Environment," management time management interventions might also help to improve sleep if the patient have sensory disorders , teaching selfmanagement addressing these issues , sometimes management for the caregiver himself can also improve sleep , quality and modifying the environment , and I"
No," think dr ham talks based a little bit on this , Including the light in the room having the temperature in the room where the patient sleeps is very important , it has to be double the bedding hello , the the whole area that , where the patient is sleeping"
No," and use of technology , we all know that the blue light - that Is emitted from I cards , tablets , phones and TV screens definitely interferes with the circadian rhythms or the biological clock of the individual and definitely impacts their sleep , and I want here to highlight"
Environment," , because , in speaking of environment , for all of you who works and hospital settings , there Is a lot of evidence that shows , unfortunately , a hospitalized patients having a poor sleep quality , and it is probably because of the complications of the , for example , the"
Environment," medications they take during their hospital stay , the medical interventions or , for example , the surgeries that they have . That might increase their pain and disrupts their sleep and also the environment , the hospital environment itself , for example , if they are in and"
No," the sleep quality of hospitalized patients , so this is something worth notice , also addressing the secondary conditions . We all know that , looking at what are the aggravating factors of a problem help you a plan what to address in your management . So , for example , if the"
No," patient has pain , decreased range of motion and if they have fatigue , they definitely should address these issues . And this will indirectly improve their sleep quality , so , in speaking of fatigue , now we 're gon na go through how you can assess fatigue and what are the"
No," management options . As I mentioned earlier , fatigue is very complex and I think I 've shown that with the many classifications and the different factors , and so it is very difficult to objectively quantify fatigue . Yes , there"
No," have been attempts to objectively quantify it through by by trying to measure the concept of fatigue ability , if you remember , I said it is the deterioration of muscle , performance or mental function over a period of time . So there have been previous attempts where"
No," we might ask the patient to do , for example , using a handheld eye , no matter doing grip , strength for specified number of repetitions and then looking at the deterioration of muscle force throughout these 15 repetitions , for example there . These are just attempts , but there is no"
No," gold standard objective measure of fatigue so commonly it is assessed using selfreported case those selfreport . The scales can give you like a total score of how fatigued someone a pure patient , is in the past two weeks and the past month or in general , or it might give you"
No, a score of the different aspects of fatigue like cognitive and physical in front of You in this table our common screening tools that you can use on various neurologic conditions . There are some fatigue validated fatigue scales that are specific for populations . For
No," example , we have the Parkinson disease fatigue scale or escape specific for MS , so I just wanted to share with you the ones that you can use with various and neurology populations . So the first one is the fatigue severity scale . It is a very quick screening tool to assess"
No," fatigue . It 'S only 9 items that measures the the severity of fatigue and its impact on the individuals , activities and lifestyle . A higher score on the scale means that there is higher fatigue , severity , usually the highest the highest or the maximum score , and"
No," well , you can have is 63 , and then the lowest is nine and again it can be used with a variety of neurologic conditions . The other one is the modified fatigue impact scale , although it 's mostly commonly used with people with MS , but it can be used with other populations ."
No," However , it 's mostly recommended for use and an MS individuals , it 's 21 items , and the good thing about this scale is that you can further have sub scores of different components of fatigue , including physical , cognitive and psychosocial and similar to the fatigue"
No," severity scale . A higher score usually indicates greater levels of perception perceived fatigue . So if we talk now about the management again due to its complicity , there is lack of consensus on what is the best treatment approach of fatigue . But I think you can actually"
Environment," , after understanding about the etiology , especially we ca n't change the disease process itself and we ca n't treat the condition , but we can have an impact on the secondary factors like pain , like sleep quality product . There is evidence that shows using sleep hygiene , education"
No," actually improves or decreases fatigue and neurologic conditions , so management usually starts actually by educating the patient about the symptom . It is not only overlooked by clinicians , mostly , but also sometimes can be ignored by the patient 's themselves . They do not"
No," understand the impact of this symptom on their quality of life and their functioning , so this is the first line of management , just educate the patient and sometimes most importantly , educate the family educate the caregiver . Unfortunately , I 'm just going to give you"
No," an example in people with MS : sometimes people like the community , they receive disability , meaning somebody is using a wheelchair , that 's it . So a lot of MS patients suffer from fatigue . They actually really"
Environment," education is the first time of treatment . There are both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions used for fatigue , management and , of course , we 're just going to highlight the non pharmacological approaches . This might include physical activity programs , so"
Environment," we 're talking here about exercises like aerobic and resistance , training , flexibility , exercises aquatic therapy , doing exercises and the pool some more low , key or low intensity exercises like yoga and Tai Chi , and I 'm gon na talk about it in a minute ."
No," In terms of , is it really beneficial or not ? We have other forms of treatment like behavioral management techniques , cognitive behavioral therapy and what we call mindfulness therapy , which is similar to cognitive , behavioral therapy . It 'S a psychosocial kind of intervention"
No," , together with meditative practices that has been used before to manage fatigue , educational and selfmanagement programs . So you educate your patient not only on acknowledging this symptom , but also on using , for example , techniques like relaxation techniques , improved sleep"
No," hygiene , as I mentioned earlier , avoid multitasking prioritizing , for example , knowing that the fatigue , for example in people with MS is worse in the afternoon , tell Your patients simply to do most of the activities of the day like early in the morning . This is part of the"
No," selfmanagement educational program , also , another growing of treatment that have been used before include physical modalities , like cooling therapy , first electromagnetic devices and mic therapy , and I 'm gon na talk about the evidence in a minute , and there is also alternative"
No," The evidence out there on fatigue is that most of the management interventions have been performed on people with MS . So you will find the high quality studies only on people with MS compared to other conditions , and this is probably due to the prevalence of this"
Environment," physical therapy interventions , mainly aerobic exercises and other physical activities . That includes resistance and flexibility exercises . The recommendation for people with MS in terms of exercise to decrease their fatigue and improve their quality of life include that they"
Environment," have to do moderate aerobic exercise at least two times a week and also do moderate intensity resistance training . At least two times per week and all the freedom to maintain proper functioning and less fatigue , we also looked at there highquality evidence regarding"
Environment," psychological and educational interventions , including the management options that I 've just mentioned , like educating your patient on prioritizing their tasks manage the others symptoms For example , sleep hygiene , education , etc and psychological interventions like"
Environment," cognitive , behavioral therapy and mindfulness therapy energy conservation interventions , including the occupation , the selfcare communication working on the patient 's biomechanics and also environmental modification regarding the factors that we mentioned earlier : the"
Environment," lye temperature , the noise , etc . If you look at the moderate quality evidence here , there is a mixed kind of interference between other populations . We find that there is some moderate quality evidence regarding multidisciplinary rehabilitation that"
No," has been found effective in minimizing fatigue . We nice , when I say multidisciplinary rehab , I 'm talking about the coordinated delivery of interventions by two or more disciplines , including nursing , physical occupational therapy , of course Social Work , psychology"
No," have . But specifically for fatigue , yes , it has been found to be effective , but there is moderate evidence on that . Homebased physical activities in stroke , patients and TBI can be effective aquatic therapy in people with MS and traumatic brain injury . Patients have been found to be"
No," effective , but again not a lot of studies . Group , educational programs done a facetoface or even online , including selfmanagement and stroke . Patients and TBI have been found to be effective and mindfulness therapy that has been used with stroke and TBI . Patients is"
No," therapy , biofeedback treatments . All these and various populations have been found , sometimes being inconsistent results and sometimes often not significant , and we ca n't compare them to other interventions because they have low quality evidence ."
Environment," So , to summarize our webinar for today , it seems that you , as a new rehabilitation specialist , have much opportunity to play an active role in providing self asleep health education and manage fatigue among your patients . You will help your patients to reduce the risk of"
No," developing sleep disorders that might make their condition even worse , reduce the effects of chronic fatigue , potentially reduce the onset of even chronic conditions and worsening of other symptoms and by helping your patients managing their sleep problems"
Environment," and Fatigue , you are : promoting sleep , health , an active lifestyle , because you are incorporating physical activity and exercise among your patients . So thank you and sleep well tonight and we are happy to answer your questions and hear the promisor . Thank you . L homme and thank"
No," , the normal time for rapid eye movement under the eye movement ? That 'S a nice question here we I would like to highlight the circadian rhythm where 's , your body . He will ask you to go sleep . So usually your body mechanism asked you to go see . Where"
No," a bedroom and there 's them ? As I mentioned , a timeline where you can get the deep sleep starting from video , where you go to bed like if you go to like 10:00 pm , you will get that TV sleep , which is four hour or three hour from your sleeping time . So 9:10 pm . It 'S"
No," asleep and run on time , asleep alternates . However , during the same cycle , as I mean , I miss her in general , non REM , asleep . However , during the first half of the night slowwave sleep is oblivion , even though we go through them , but it 's more prevalent . So if we go through the London"
No," , if you will spend most of your time , slow wave sleep , the deep sleep , but the still that 's 90 second 90 minutes . So is there any variation between patients like , for example , students , graduate students , difficulty sleeping or patients ? Do they have variations in these dysfunctions"
No," example , older individuals in older individuals . If you all , you will have much more like 60 percent . Fifty to sixty percent of your night is age 1 and stage 2 , which is the shallow sleeping samam . So the remember there 's no wave sleep decrease and nonrapid eye movement also"
No," , but you know what 's the difficult thing here , that we need sleep lab . Nothing gives you this information , except the sleep lab . So you need , does the most expensive way to know that , but there is a lot of studies have been done on different population . Do you know , dr"
No," myself ? There is any one young individual . I can add that the problem that might arise is that if somebody have poor sleep quality which is chronic , there are a different kind of sleep disorders like we ca n't kind of mention them all . But , for example , there is a specific line or"
No, an umbrella term of disorders called circadian rhythm disorders in which they people might have really altered . Ratios of different sleep stages because of various factors . It could be something physiological or could be basically just because of bad
No," habits . That led to having them having poor sleep quality and , in general , from the time of infancy until as a doctor in Hampstead until somebody 's older adult . Yes , the sleep structure changes all the time . The what we represented today is the anointment for an adult to go from"
No," 90 to 110 . However , there are certain yes , sleep disorders and bad sleeping habits that might interfere with the structure and the of the sleep and another problem that might arise is what we call a night to night sleep variability . If someone sleep every night differently , that"
No," definitely will affect their sleep structure , because you need to have those 4 to 5 cycles every night . So if one night , you are sleepdeprived and the other night you 're , not you 're kind of missing out the the the importance of having this rhythm routinely . That 'S why"
Environment," one of the sleep hygiene , education tips is that you go to your bed and wake up . On the same time , every day and night so that you have those full cycles without messing up the structure and the race two of these factors - and this leads me to another question - let 's say we analyze"
No," that and we send the patient to sleep analysis asleep , laugh . So yeah , so so so as a clinician as an OT as a PT , what does that make a difference ? You know the analysis . The result of this . What does this variation like affect my suggestions and deaths for this patient ?"
Environment," So so as new rehabilitation , specialist you 're not going to really interfere with the like ? The assessment are using polysomnography or the sleep lab , but it will help your patient to have a diagnosis . So , as dr and I mentioned in part of the assessment , you can help your"
No," patient first by highlighting that there is something wrong when you screen for having a sleep problem and by asking the Pramod questions that might show that there 's an underlying issue like insomnia or Obstructive sleep apnea you further screen for that , and if it 's"
No," actually , your patient is risky . Now they have to have an official diagnosis . It 'S important to highlight that polysomnography is important for diagnosing these common sleep disorders . Having a screening tool will only give you if the patient is risk , have a higher"
No," risk or not , but having a diagnosis . They have to go to a sleep specialist and have a sleep lab drug assessment and then get the diagnosis to get the appropriate treatment obstructive . Sleep apnea is very dangerous ."
No," issues . Okay , I can not perform or behead going back in go back again to sleep . Apnea example that dr Mayes mentioned . If our patients have sleep apnea , as also she mentioned , it 's very dangerous condition . This might interrupt your motor learning and you need to"
No," treat that you need to refill that sure you 'll at fall asleep the physician who can treat the patient , because there 's many studies have done and give us evidence that it interrupt your sleep , your motor learning . So there is no offline motor learning . The beneficial"
No," effect on motor learning will not happen , so we need to treat that again . There 'S a lot of evidence coming now telling us that we can help as a physical therapist and occupational therapist , I 'm not sure the quality of evidence , because it 's an early studies we need more studies to be"
Environment," done , but exercise can benefit . Exercise can be a beneficial route of intervention to help people with sleep apnea and one of the slide that we present tell us about in Samina and the effect of exercise on improving and the insomnia symptoms for our patient ."
No," Someone is asking about slide number 22 . Can you please repeat that or go over it again ? Okay , what 's the specific cost , this is slide is talked about procedural memory formation . So if you are learning a new task , you you will go through the memory to have a memory inside european"
No," where your participants engage with the task and perform the action so successful acquisition in attaining certain level of task proficiency . So let me give example : if you are learning how to drive , you are enjoy driving lessons or whatever , and in the first session you"
No," start to engage with the car with the ceiling with different part of a car . So you end the session with a certain level of a proficiency and this need to perform . I mean really the presentation within the prayer all right , so you go back home . If you sleep , if you sleep , you"
No," will get beneficial effect of sleep like you go to the consolidation . Where is the plane organize the memory about driving put it on greatest races ? So you will not forget about driving , and this is what we call consolidation , the converging that happen to the memory traces from liable"
No," stage , where we ca n't forget it where we can lose it into more permanent case . Then , after consolidation , it is restored that in our pain and really call it for another , you using the toggle off stage , which is very calling . Is there a specific question about it , as I"
No," mentioned here that sleep affects each stage but the most stage . That really studies have studied its virtualization and we , as a group and just say University , have done like three four studies out importing this should this should do ? Are the two types of fatigue"
No," classified only in MS disease ? Okay , so I think the question is about cognitive versus motor fatigue , so it 's mostly used to classify fatigue in people with MS . But , however , yes , that does n't mean that , as I mentioned in the presentation that patients with stroke can can complain"
No," about having physical fatigue , TBI patients can also have problems with cognitive fatigue . So the answer - the short answer is no . It is not just specific for people with MS , but it is generally used to classify that in ms , because how it 's very , let 's say"
No," , prevalence in this condition : okay , smartwatches , can they especially open things and other sleep analysis ? Are they reliable yeah ? This is a very , very good question , and not only for smartwatches , but there 's a lot of sleep , apps"
No," , yeah or used in the phone . Like I do n't know , 500 something I once read an article . Let 'S start with a good part . The good part about using these sleep trackers is that it actually gives you something to reflect on , so you can use it with your patient to help your"
Environment," patient , for example , recognize their patterns of their sleep habits so part of selfmanagement and education , but when it comes To reliability and validation , unfortunately , I think all of the sleep trackers out there . They are not validated with the gold standard"
No," objective measures of sleep which is polysomnography , so that does not make it a lot reliable in terms of the results , however , it can be used to give kind of a feedback mechanism to your patient about what their sleep habits Is but it is not actually , then that"
No," It 'S very good . There 'S been actually a recent study that looked at the use of sleep assessment and pediatric patients . Unfortunately , there has been not a lot of assessments that has been validated in children . There are a couple of ones that has been especially specifically"
No," developed for children . One of them is the children 's report of sleep patterns , so this one can be used . However , it is does not does not have a lot of strong psychometric properties in terms of the ones that we explain , which is the Pittsburgh and the Epworth . Unfortunately"
No," , no psychometric reports and children , but there are a couple of ones that that can be used . If you do n't have that sort of an assessment just by knowing the recommended time hours in terms of sleep , duration , for children 's and infancy , and just by having an interview like with"
Environment," the parents about what are their sleeping habits , their lifestyle factors the environment . This will it can promise at least and help you to highlight . If there is a problem , are there questions ? If you just read the bits brain , you will tell that it 's it 's not ! So I probable"
No," okay , so I thought , has a SmartWatch which have a sleep analysis program . I do n't know which time but she wants to know what is the normal duration for light and deep sleep like , and I did light sleep and deep sleep . So , let 's for a healthy adult , you spend around , like 13"
No," to 2 percent of your total sleep time in deep sleep . So deep sleep is the like the lowest percentage compared as a ratio . If that 's , I think what she wants to know . So , for example , if you sleep eight hours per night"
No," roughly , you will spend 62 like 110 minutes 1 hour and 10 minutes almost two hours , sorry and and deep sleep compared to night sleep . Okay , what 's your take on hypnosis therapy and what 's your opinion about that , they say that 15 minutes of hypnosis"
No," for you , dr Harmon , dr Massey . If you want to say the last anything else , okay , so thank you so much dr Muhammad for this opportunity to give our talk . Thank thank you for our audience . I hope you will get your expectation out of this presentation and he helped about any"
Environment," sleep and fatigue issue . We will be happy to help any training on assessment . Would we offer in this presentation thanks for your time , and I hope you will be fine people and home ? Thank you so much ! Yes , thank you so much for attendance and I can"
No," Well, we all need a reason to wake up. For me, it just took 11,000 volts. I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you. One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I were horsing around,"
No," My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society:"
No," that loss, for example, became fact, fixed necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while, but I learned it eventually. Now, another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver"
No," But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. How we die is indeed something we can affect. Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day. After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care,"
No," is to relieve suffering not add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside: palliative care a very important field but poorly understood while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice."
No," We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves. In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in the next moment. Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another."
Environment," Frank has always been an adventurer he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River. Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no."
No," heading for the gate, we pause. Anyone who wants fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body with flower petals. It takes a few minutes;"
No," it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting, much like this floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person had never really existed."
No," Wellintended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness."
No," including good palliative care for my pain. And one night, it began to snow outside. I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it. And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky. Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me. She brought it in to the unit."
Environment," I know we can because we have to. The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar. We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with. We know, for example, from research"
No," what's most important to people who are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality. Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little. Take Janette."
No," She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS. Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again and French cigarettes, if you please. Not out of some selfdestructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled while she has them. Priorities change."
No," So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body the very thing doing the living and the dying. Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all. But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels:"
No," success or the career or the people in my life , and then the coping mechanisms were like incredibly selfdestructive . I'Ve been working on getting sober since I was 20 . I just like held on to that belief that real Lucy came out when she was drinking . I tried to change for my"
No," mom . I tried to change for my career . One of my best friends died of alcoholism and that still did n't make me want to get sober . None of that Works , alcohol is n't the problem . The problem is this feeling inside of me . I have to try it a different way . Was there a Darkest Day ?"
No," what this year brings for this show for us as a community and for this platform I tend to start these podcasts in a very similar way , and I think , in your case it 's never been more pertinent . To start in that way , which is to understand your context , I 've got to"
No," horrible journey , and I um love that I can sit across from you now and be my most authentic self . So that 's a long way of saying . I 'M glad to be here , and it 's not is it . It makes you emotional because you 're happy where you are now"
No, chapter in your life to understand the journey and the direction that Journey took um yeah so from Memphis uh families all still in Tennessee ? I have an older sister who I adore and admire so so much
No," um . I mainly lived with my mom growing up my dad 's still in the picture , but they were divorced really young and I was just what was I like as a child . I was , I think , as long as I can remember , I 've"
No," always felt kind of like , and I do n't mean this in a sad way like in a victim way . I'Ve always felt like I was on the outside . Looking in like I never had a lot of friends . I never felt the need to make friends or be social like after"
No," school . I would n't want to go to a friend 's house . I would I would rush to get home to go be alone with myself , so I 've kind of always craved this feeling of needing Solitude , because that 's when I could sort of be myself - and I felt that as early as"
No," you know - 10 years old , but um , I Guess my love of entertaining uh came from my mom was married to this man , who heard me singing in my room when I was probably like six or seven"
No," , I loved Aladdin , I loved Disney movies , and I I vividly remember like pretending to be Jasmine on the Magic Carpet and I would just sing with my little tapes and - and he told my mom like Lucy 's - got a good voice and up until that point I had never . You"
No," Miley Cyrus and it was then it was that moment in that audition . Where I was thinking . Oh , I can act and sing at the same time like this is my dream . This is my way out . You know and um way out I 'll get yeah I 'll you 're . So smart ! Yes , so I I now as an"
No," season anymore because of streaming and and everything . But it 's when a network pays money for one episode to see if they want to invest in doing a series . You know what a pilot season is , but um . I talked to my mom into moving out to California and when I mean taught , I"
No," did n't talk her into it . I think it was perfect timing for her and for me and we packed up our Prius and all of our stuff , which was n't a lot . I come from a very simple upbringing and my mom was a travel nurse . She cashed"
No," There was not . I did n't feel like home . I never knew where I fit in um . I felt I love my family so much , but I always felt like the black sheep of the family . I just felt different , even as a little kid and um"
No," yeah that yeah I I 've got chills then just thinking about it because and as you were speaking , there was a lot of like through Lines and similarities as to what you were saying , like Maisie , really kind of lost her identity in because she was a very young actress and"
No," um you know you hear about so many people staying together for the kids . Oh my ! No , if my I 'm so glad that my parents separated because it was the best thing for everyone and why um it was n't a happy marriage . I do n't"
No," raised by a single mom for a lot of my childhood . She was remarried for a little bit , but my my dad is now back in my life and he 's given me so many lessons I mean , I think that anything , that 's traumatic or painful . Like I sort of just use that as"
No," liberating when you look at something when you look at things that have happened to you when you 're a child and say what beautiful lesson did I get out of that and if we 're just taking my parents divorce As an example , the biggest lesson I learned from that"
No," I 've worked too hard to Feel how I feel today for a jobs , experiences , people relationships , lovers , friends , whatever it is like got ta meet me here , and it does n't mean you ca n't compromise with people . That 'S"
No," Yes , I I did n't . I saw you pulling out your left wrist , so I just went with it yeah . I love you yes , so what role did she play ? So she , her name was Karen and she was my dad 's mom and my grandmother rest in peace . You amazing Soul . She was the"
No," senses my grandmother 's , energy and and every kind of experience like that . My grandmother 's energy has showed up , so I truly believe that she is here with me , but she was just smart and she thought differently than anyone in my family and"
No," as an adult . I can look back and think I 'm so much like her like I just I miss her . She died really young . She died of emphysema and it 's shocking . I never picked up smoking because I I told you I 'm like an extremist , but I 've never been a smoker because of her and"
No," was 15 . So I maybe had just gotten one of those Sidekicks or Nokia phones , and I just do n't have that much tangible memories of her you named after they right yeah , yeah , Karen Lucille and uh , so she definitely lives on in me in that way"
No," and um yeah . That 'S nice to chat about her . Thank you for bringing her up . I was really inspired by um the love your mother must have had it for you , but also really the belief she"
No," must have had in you to move to LA with you when you were 15 . I 'M assuming purely so , you could pursue a career in Hollywood at 15 years old yeah , it 's totally bizarre , and when I tell people that I just have to set the tone , my mom was not a stage mom at all , and by that I"
No, just instilled a lot of willpower . My mom is such a hard worker . I do believe I have my I get my drive and work ethic from her and she 's so selfless like she would give her last penny to anyone and just loves with her entire heart um and my my mom and I have definitely
No," um . I have no idea how , because , because I often think if I had a daughter who wanted to do what I want to do , would I do that ? I do n't know how do you know it 's kind of insane ? Isn'T it thanks Mom for being insane ? I love you for it like , thank God"
No," um in this building right by the Sea line , and then I now 19 years later just was working Up there again and I look out the window of the building , I was living in it 's the exact same building my mom lived in , and I 'm like . That is just"
No," the universe , full circle . It was the coolest full circle moment of being 16 there , with my mom on my first job , to everything , that 's transpired to me being 33 working there . Now it was just like this really incredible moment , but but yeah I uh"
No," started kind of working supporting myself since 17 and then I think my mom saw that I somewhat had a good head on my shoulders by 18 and then she moved back to Tennessee . That period between you being 16 and 19 , when you"
No," memories are kind of blurry . From that time I it 's so weird , like I ca n't even answer that question . I think I think I was very grateful to be in LA and pursuing this dream , but that was"
No," uh . So yeah I mean I guess I look back on that time and I have compassion now like I do n't want to say . I feel sorry for myself , but I do believe in . Like I mean I was a teenager , but all the inner child work where you just kind of"
No," , similarly about my childhood , I have certain memories , but I do n't know . Maybe I was disassociating a lot . I told you I lived in my head . A ton - so I do n't know it seems like so much has happened since then"
No," we learn this idea that we 're not enough , As kids , one of the things he said to me , which is still sat with me , is he said to me : he goes . Children are narcissists , he goes when the parents arguing the child , thinks it 's about them yeah and when he said that to me I go . Oh , my God , it"
No," different scenarios , so I 'm certain I learned it at a young age and and as kids , none of us come out unscathed right , like we all take on some sort of pain and Trauma from somewhere or someone , but mine manifested as An eating"
Environment," 1415 , was starting homeschooling and I had to start logging my exercise hours and why it was for PE and you had to say I 'm do . I did PE today for x amount of time and that 's the only thing I can think of that started . This obsession with"
No," know that we need food to survive and - and I like I like , and love and respect my body too . If I 'm tired , I rest . If I want to work out , I work out . I I can just sort of navigate feeling uncomfortable . So much better these days . Well , you have n't given given a diagnosis"
No," for that disorder . Was there ever medical intervention yeah ? I did my mom um shortly before she moved to Tennessee . You know she recognized . It was a problem and she helped in the best way she knew how but I 'm sure , as a parent , she felt"
No," , because of the influence of you know , advertising and movies , especially back then um , social media Etc . I yeah I just ca n't yeah . I ca n't having never experienced an eating disorder before , but then thinking about being in"
Environment," this environment yeah well , what was interesting is that it started before I even moved to LA the eating disorder was for when I was like 13 before I 'd even thought about . You know"
No," , even though I hated myself and like real confidence is not ? I read my whole Instagram now is just like silly affirmations , but it helped , but I read something the other day . That 'S true confidence is not . I hope they like me : it 's some I 'm paraphrasing"
No," , but not . I hope they like me . It 'S I 'm okay and know who I am even if they do n't and yeah exactly what it is , and that confidence is what I 've been searching for my whole life and to know that and to show up anywhere . I go with anyone with new"
No," people and say I 'm accepted , because I accept myself . I have value because I value myself , you can put me in any situation anything I truly mean this and I have the Confidence that I 'll get through it sober and happy"
No," because a lot of my life post success , I did not feel worthy of the success or the career or the people in my life . It was like this limiting belief that you 're a fraud If people really knew who you were they would n't like . You"
No," happening ? It 'S because I had this belief that I did n't deserve any of it . When you live with that sort of lack of selfworth , it manifests itself in a variety of ways . One of them you talked about already , which is trying to gain"
No," What does that do ? Well , it builds anger and resentment . Well then , if you repress that anger resentment , then what happens ? Well , it 's going to come out some way and for me my like for such a small human , I have so much rage in that I 've"
No," friends , my family , who are just the greatest people in the world and have stood by my side . For you know , I 've been working on getting sober since I was 20 , I 'm 33 . It takes time it took time and it took patience with myself ."
No," Um I mean this is a topic I could talk about until the end of time , but basically what alcohol did for me . We did a couple of things . It was like . It was like this feeling of oh , my God . This is what I 've been searching for . My"
No, This is when I 'm younger right - and I just like held on to that belief - that real Lucy came out when she was drinking guess what real Lucy did come out . But it was that rage and pain that I had been holding on to for so long . But it also
No," was past drink too . Don'T remember , I would n't remember the rest of the night um through what period of your life was this sorry , since you were young , I 've had an issue I from my very first experience drinking"
No," and you know , of course I tried trying to be a moderate Drinker . Just having to my , I have an allergy to alcohol . I can not drink . I view it as an allergy to alcohol . My brain does n't work the same way as someone who can just have a glass of wine . It always"
No," wants more . It 'S like craving that that feeling my best friend has just actually finished a documentary on this subject matter . He was my best friend , but also my business partner for many years and the the point where he realized . He had a problem . We kind of"
No," have to leave yeah . You know and yeah . You can do a lot of damage right when you 're , when you have that relationship with alcohol , and you have an addiction to alcohol and it brings out that side of you did . You ever have moments like that where people"
No," I wanted to keep drinking . I was like , oh , my reaction to alcohol is different than my friends like this is different and I 've known I had a problem this whole time . I was . There was never a moment where I thought it was normal . There have been"
No," , who is an angel truly an Earth Angel , I believe , has saved my life at times like this woman has been there for me . She 'S had hard conversations with me . I'Ve had friends , who 've tough loved me , but I 've had friends who say we ca n't until you do x , y and z."

No," so in my head about it , but I it would be so Dark , I was thinking then , because my business partner described it as he . There was a pain he was trying to escape , which we just never realized . He had a pain in his in his life . In his mind , I would find him"
No," downstairs through him in the morning . In the laundry room with the lights off drinking , I thought just he just loves alcohol right . That 'S what people think or like . Oh you like to party yeah exactly but but I came to learn that there was a pain he was escaping that he"
No," had n't addressed . Yes , is that the same in your situation , where there was an unaddressed , pain or issue that you think you were using alcohol as a Escape mechanism ? For yes , definitely I mean alcohol is n't the problem . The problem is this feeling inside of me , alcohol was"
No," um yeah . For me , it was definitely old , stuff old feelings , pain . I I do think that , like I said I would have struggled with this . No matter what I did for a living , but I think finding success at an early age and the people , pleasing and and and trying to be"
No," at the end of the day I 've had to allow - and I believed that too I ran with that . Lucy , you do n't deserve to be unhappy . How dare you feel these things ? But now I know I 'm a human being and Everything 's Relative - and I"
No," absolutely love them . My life means that I sometimes disregard my diet and it 's funny . That 'S part of the reason why I 've had a lot of guests on this podcast recently that talk about diet and health and those kinds of things , because I am trying to make an active effort to be"
No," day . I did a virtual event using the studio which I think about 700 of you came to TV level , production quality all done by one person , with very little technical experience on a laptop . So if you 've got an event coming up and you 're thinking about doing it virtually check"
No," I do n't remember what it was called , but it was a really shitty TV movie that I do n't even think did it get made . Yes , it did get made and I at one point was thinking I want to take this movie because there was a really cute guy attached to it . You can"
No," this . And if I 'm uh lucky enough to get to do , I hope I can do this the rest of my life but um it . It helps me hone my craft . I , the fact that that show went for that . Long is almost unheard of"
No," um , but I never packed my bags or made a call to someone and told them , but but but there were times in my 20s , where I was just thinking - is this what I want to do , but but then it became about It was n't because I disliked acting , I"
No," crave creating and and and acting and I and I was there have been moments in my life , where I was scared that , oh , my God , I 'm gon Na have to keep doing this and not know . If I love it , and it was I did this show and the moment where it all like happened for me"
No," someone is more avoided than I am anyway , so yes failed relationships , but but we , the first model of love we learn , is our our parents . No , I totally get it . I. I grew up . Thinking , love was n't safe or safe thing , or I thought it was prison yeah or if love is this , I do n't want"
No, that . Are you kidding me so I never really had a model of what a relationship should be and - and I maybe because my parents got divorced and I spent more time with my mom that I was drawing in more people who were
No," similar to my dad . You know there 's that element . Where are you now with my with my dad with you with my relationship yeah with on that journey of like understanding , love and how to form an attachment with someone in a healthy way , yeah with the right person ?"
No," strengths and weaknesses and know what they have to offer and are willing to grow and heal and evolve and and I 've never had that , like I 've , never Had a relationship that felt safe or like , I could really show up as myself"
No," I was n't getting certain calls like . I was n't being invited to certain things . People move on quickly right , like people just love content like they will move on to a new show and - and it was so scary to be like where , where do I forget fit in do ? Will people remember me and it 's like"
No," chasing this high of whatever that experience was and then I came to realize like that 's so exhausting like I feel like I 'm okay . Now , if I were to just do jobs under the radar for the rest of my life , you know I , like I said I mentioned earlier , like"
No," However , I am at any given moment whatever that looks like , and I have not been able to do that until recently . I feel like I am confident in what I have to offer , I 'm comfortable with who I am I 'm a good friend , I 'm loyal , I 'm honest to a fault ."
No," , and I do believe my intentions with people are good and at the end of the day I can sleep at night really well , because I like Who I am , and it 's just as simple as that I like my choices but , as you say , that 's been a journey"
No," right , yeah yeah , you used the word earlier use the word compassion to describe . You know you talk about that , like in a child work that you 've done yeah um . How do you feel about that person that"
Environment, you that went through that Journey ? What would you say to that person if they were sat on a chair ? They were on a third chair on this table yeah . What would you try and I uh I 've actually done that exercise where you write a letter to your younger self

No," do n't typically go with the flow , I 'm not a go with the flow kind of gal um , but I you know my priorities are a little different . Now , like I do want a family , I think recently , I 'm I decided I do want kids . I have two lovely dogs , my goal . Now I"
No," , and it 's not for the reasons you might think I mean if I 'm proud of my work ethic and and the things I 've accomplished , but I 'm proud that I 've faced . What I thought were my worst fears"
No," , whether it 's for success or work , or whether it 's Trying to escape some trauma , or some some other thing - that 's living deep with inside of you , but either way the attempt to escape yourself through creating an identity or alcohol or whatever it always seems to"
No," Um I 'd say about half of the time . Now I do . I really feel like I show up for my friends and I 'm a words of affirmation gal like I always let people know , I 'm grateful for them and I 'm just like a lover . You"
No," I mean definitely my mom , but I tell her this all the time . Thank you , uh , my manager , who I also tell all the time . Thank you she , my I would not be where I am personally"
No," There 'S one woman in particular , who is still a friend , but her name is Joanna Garcia , she 's , an actress and she was number one on the call she lead of the show privileged . I did on the CW and I remember"
Environment," Hi guys i 'm dr tara , tobias , i wan na welcome y'all back to this channel . In today 's home exercise tutorial we are gon na go over fatigue , so fatigue is a pretty common symptom with a variety of diagnoses . So i thought it would be a good topic ."
No," I 'M gon na try and make it a video that 'll apply to a lot of you , because this community is starting to grow a little bit and we 're getting a wide range of people watching these videos with a variety of neurologic conditions"
No, the most out of your rehab . So it is something that i usually address with my patients that i see in person . So i thought maybe i would just go over some tips that might help you to manage your fatigue or a better way
No," to put . It is to control your energy levels and hopefully that will help you to get the most out of your rehab , which is my ultimate goal with all of these videos , but before we dive into that , if you 're new to this channel - and you"
No, have n't yet subscribed - go Ahead and hit that subscribe button turn on that notification bell so that you 'll get notified every time . I upload new videos and now let 's go ahead and dive in so fatigue .
No," Fatigue is just a feeling of overall weariness , exhaustion or an aversion to putting in effort and there 's a variety of things that can cause this physical exertion mental exertion and then there 's also an area i 'm going"
No," to touch on just a little bit . Although i 'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist or a licensed counselor , but there is also psychological fatigue , and i do want to touch on that just a little bit because i do think"
No, it 's an important area to cover . But first what is physical fatigue ? So physical fatigue is where you see a decline in someone 's performance as they perform more and more repetitions of a physical activity .
No," Mental fatigue is seeing a decline in thinking performance as someone performs more and more things that require mental challenges or thinking challenges , and if you have ms , this is usually due to"
No," prematurely than maybe prior to you . Having ms or things might cause you to get tired more than someone who does n't have ms parkinson 's disease same thing , movement is just harder , so it requires more energy ."
No," So you might experience fatigue with fewer repetitions , stroke , brain injury , same thing . Everything requires more effort . So the more you perform something physically , the faster you 're going to"
No," get fatigued . Also , we ca n't forget thinking problem solving memory . All that stuff just require for some of you requires a little bit more thought or energy , or maybe things that you did n't have to think about before , like planning out your day"
No," harder to stay engaged in a conversation to follow a conversation . So all those are cognitive activities and i 'm going to get to that a little bit further . When i talk about some of the tips that i have to help , you manage your fatigue , but do n't forget"
No," all of that probably requires a little bit more thinking now . So we ca n't forget that social activities , although they 're fun , still might cause fatigue that you might not have experienced anymore again because of everything i just said just"
No," requires a little bit more energy and then quickly psychological fatigue . So psychological fatigue is just lack of motivation . Losing interest in activities losing motivation , anything like that would kind of fall under that category"
No," of psychological fatigue , and the only reason that i bring this up is because there 's an overlap between psychological fatigue and depression , and actually there is a consensus in a lot of the Standardized tests that fatigue is one"
No, criteria when a licensed psychologist is diagnosing someone with depression or doctors . Diagnosing someone with depression fatigue is one of the criteria within the diagnosis of depression . So i 'm just gon na touch on that real
No," find your identity in is now gone . There is a grieving process and part of that grieving process is anger just getting mad , and i always worry about the patients that tell me they never"
No," were angry about their situation , because there 's a piece of me that thinks that , eventually , that anger is going to emerge In other ways , or that person 's just imploding on the inside , it 's healthy as part of the grieving process . To get to a"
No," i Couldn'T cite it or tell you where i read it , depression is anger turned inward . So if you never move through that anger and maybe get stuck in that angry stage , it might just be an area that you want to look into seek some counseling"
No," to get through . That process , because it could be turning into a depression which could be a contributing factor to your fatigue . But it 's also something that you might want to bring up with your doctor , because there are chemical imbalances"
No," that do happen after a stroke or a brain injury . And so definitely something that you want to talk to your doctor about , but back to the physical and the mental fatigue . These are things that are very real and"
No," those ones ? I have to have the conversation with that are just the gogetter and you just want to go . Go go , go all the time . Well , keep in mind everything i just mentioned . That could be contributing to your fatigue that maybe was n't there"
No," before you had your stroke or before your ms diagnosis or before your first ms exacerbation , and that is this idea that your body is just using more energy and you only have one pot of energy . I relate it a lot of"
No," tired all the time ? So i tell people , do n't cut things out , but just live smarter , so do n't live harder , just live smarter and that gets into this idea of having a fatigue journal , something that i encourage my patients"
No," to do and it 's basically just a journal or an activity journal . I call it a fatigue journal because you 're going to be rating your fatigue , but basically you just track your activities every day . You rate your fatigue on a scale from 0"
No," to 10 in the morning and then a scale from 0 to 10 every night . Zero . Being you have no energy at all and you 're completely exhausted . Your battery is on zero , ten being you 're full of energy , and you"
No," could run a marathon tomorrow . If you had to now every morning you should be at about the same level of energy . So every morning you know , i would say , it 'd be healthy to be anywhere even with a neurologic"
No," condition between like a six and an eight and then at the end of the day . Maybe you get a little bit below that , but then a good night 's sleep and you should be back up to that same level that you were at the previous morning . So i tell"
No," everyone like a good quality night sleep . You should be like plugging that phone back in and you should be recharged by the next morning , if that 's not happening , that gets into the second component of this fatigue . Journal"
No," you 're gon na write everything down every day that you do so every activity , regardless of how small talking on the phone to a family member . How long did you talk on the phone to that family member going to the grocery store"
No, going out to eat with a friend visiting with your kids ? Anything like that ? You just want to track that and do n't leave anything out any activity . You did that day and just do that for about a week and see what
No," go out to dinner with your family that night , you know maybe go out to dinner with your family on the following night or just space , your activities out again do n't cut anything out . Just live smarter and definitely , most importantly"
Environment," , with your exercises if you 're exhausted after therapy , maybe keep that in mind and do n't plan any activities after therapy or if you know , you 're , going out to dinner with family , and you really want to enjoy that time ."
No," Maybe do n't do as much therapy that day so that you can enjoy that time with your family . Those are just a few examples of ways to live , smarter , not harder . Now . One other point i want to bring up for - and this is specifically for people"
No," If you do think that you might be dealing with some of that psychological fatigue , that 's it for this video . I hope it was helpful . If you have any questions or comments about this , i do n't think it 's . The first video i 'm"
No," gon na do on fatigue . There 'S a lot of you guys that have ms that are starting to join this community , and it 's really a big topic of conversation with ms . So definitely leave your comments below . If you have any questions about this or"
No," subscribe . Button turn on that notification bell give this video a thumbs up . If you liked this topic of fatigue , i enjoyed spending time with you all today and i look forward to seeing you on the next video . You have a good day ."
No," So you 're lacking energy . You feel tired , I get it , but the good news is in this week 's video I 'm going to teach you how to keep those energy levels up . So , let 's begin with lifestyle factors . Now , in today 's 24/7 world we tend to cram in so much into our life . Don'T we tend to suffer because we start to forget about looking after ourselves now before we begin running through the tips . I want you to think about these few question . So , what 's your diet like ? Is it healthy ? Are you eating lots of fruit ? Are you in lots of veg ?"
No," Are you sleeping well ? Are you having your meals on time ? Are you having lots of alcohol drinking lots of caffeine , drinking lots of energy drinks ? So please really think about these , as we run through the tips , so lifestyle tip number one , which is probably one of the most important things , is you need to make sure that you 're having a healthy , balanced diet , because it 's the foundation to your energy . So you need to be having whole grains . You need to be having proteins , you need to have fruit , you need have veg , but it 's not as simple as this"
No," to explain in this short video . So thankfully , the NHS have done a really good article on this on how to have a healthy , balanced diet , and I will leave a link in the description below which I would recommend everyone to read , just to make sure you 're doing everything right . Lifestyle tip number two by the way I do think this shot is a little low , but there 's a reason for it and if it works , it 's gon na look quite cool eat at regular intervals . So if you do this , it should help sustain your energy levels and also do n't miss breakfast because"
No," apparently a third of us . This is a third apparently miss it , and that 's not going to help sustain energy levels so eat at regular intervals , have three meals a day and if you get peckish in between it and you feel like having a little snack , have some healthy fruits lifestyle tip number Three eating iron rich food , because if your iron levels are low , it can leave you feeling tired and rundown . Now . This is especially important in teenagers and , ladies because you 're at higher risk of losing iron in your menstrual blood during your periods . Now , let 's sit on that"
No," chair for the next bit now , the good news is that there 's loads of foods that are really rich in iron , for example , you 've got red meat , green vegetables and even fortified foods like cereals . I will also leave a full list in the description below for you as well tip number four : are you staying hydrated ? Well , it 's recommended that we 're having six to eight glasses of water a day and by the way , this is an addition to the fluids that we get from our food . You should also watch your alcohol intake , as this can cause dehydration and also"
No," caffeine . Yes , it 's true caffeine will give you that kick , and it will give you that energy , but with time you 're gon na build tolerance and you 're gon na need more and more and more caffeine . To give you the same level of energy and when you 're not getting that you 're gon na feel more tired , and please remember that both alcohol and caffeine are gon na affect your sleep quality . So in the long term you are gon na feel more tired because of this lifestyle tip number five so cut down on sugar . Now , generally speaking , we know the"
No," people in the UK , adults and children eat way too much sugar , and I know you 're gon na get sugar kick to begin with , that buzz of energy , we 're going to quickly have a sugar low and it 's going to leave tired and It 'S gon na leave , you drained now you maybe take it to yourself , but Abraham . How on earth do I cut down sugar , it 's so much easier said than done and you 're right , sugars in almost everything it 's in fruit , it 's in veg , however , the ones in fruit and veg are fine , so you 're completely fine to have them , but in terms of cutting Down sugar , it is very"
No," complicated , but thankfully the NHS have done a really good article on this about foods that have more sugar and how to cut down . So what I will do is I 'll leave a link in the description below for you , and I guarantee you if you read this you 're gon na become a sugar whizz . Okay , so we 've done diet . But now , let 's look at some other issues . So a few common questions . I ask my patients : are : are you exercising ? Are you napping during the day and also are you taking any medicines any herbal medicines , because some of these can cause tiredness too ? So"
No," let 's go onto that ? Okay , so imagine this for one ! Second , I have a pill and it 's a magical pill . It 'S amazing ! When you take it , it 's gon na boost your mood . It 'S gon na boost your sleep quality . It 'S gon na boost your energy levels . It 'S gon na reduce your risk of certain medical conditions . Like heart , disease , diabetes and many more and best of all , it has no side effect and it 's completely free . Now , unfortunately , this pill does n't exist , but I think if it did"
Environment," , everyone in the world would be taking it , including myself . Well , my friends , the name of that magical pill is exercise and I 'm afraid it 's not as easy as taking a pill . I'Ll give you that . Let me put the magical pill way , but if you do fit it in you 're , gon na get all the benefits I 've mentioned and they 're all proven . So please try to fit it into your daily schedule and reap the rewards .

No," There 'S no single food , including those labeled superfoods , that can compensate an unhealthy diet . There 'S also no evidence that suggests that one single food can boost your energy levels . Most people do n't need a vitamin supplement to boost their energy levels and you can get all of these from a healthy , balanced diet . Now , there 's also medical reasons that can cause tiredness , and it 's recommended that you should speak to your doctor about these .

No," You maybe even have a good diet . You get enough sunshine , you 're moving , but you 're just exhausted . Why are you constantly tired ? You might have a condition called chronic fatigue . It 'S a complex disorder without one real big cause , but right"
No," here on this video , i 'm gon na break down for you in detail what it is the symptoms of it . So you can understand if you have it and then explore some natural steps or lifestyle changes that you can make to tackle chronic fatigue once and for all . So , let 's dive into it ."
No," What is chronic fatigue ? Chronic fatigue is a unique , difficult disorder , namely characterized by long lasting extreme exhaustion . Extreme fatigue can last up to six months . In some cases , chronic conviction could be related uh to other"
No," conditions that tie into this that make it last even longer so adrenal fatigue is one . That 'S really tied into it , uh also just inflammation throughout the entire body . Some of this you can really feel uh . It could be causing palpitations in the heart . It could be . Creating real"
No," feeling the fatigue accompanied by it . I said , joint pain , the muscle pain concentration , really starts to suffer uh . Fogginess in the brain inability to you know clearly think losing your memory . Your shortterm"
No," memory kind of getting forgetful on things uh lymph nodes up in here , especially around the neck area , enlarged tender , lymph nodes , anxiety , mental strain or even a depressive disorder can be linked back to just facing exhaustion , you 're , just"
No," not getting enough rest you 're getting this Fatigue , headaches swelling the sore throat sweating at night , just tenderness , in areas digestive disorder , so it might speed up"
No," it 's possible , it could slow down . You could have you know reflux due to some of it . The you know , just kind of a malaise just feeling chronic fatigue is such a difficult condition to nail down , because there 's"
No," and you 're , probably like yeah . I have a few of those dr living good . Well then , maybe we should just start addressing it from a whole level , but let 's look at what causes it . First number : one uh from a fatigue perspective , low immune system function , low immune system activity can"
No," really drain the body 's energy of a regular immune system being able to fight it 's sucking energy from your day to day , and so it 's constantly in a war and it 's draining A lot of your resources , the hormones - can get very imbalances"
No," imbalanced . It can also zap all that energy away because you just end up feeling tired all the time because you 're not producing the right amount of hormones , you 're , not balancing the hormones properly . This can be a big energy drain if a virus is present in"
No," the body . This viral infection uh for the same reason , zaps the energy , your body 's , putting a lot of resources out to fight the virus and it does n't have the resources left to just give you the energy for your day to day . If your blood pressure is too low , you 're , not getting"
No," enough nutrients and oxygen around your system , that is a huge culprit . Oxidative stress the damage from what we 're eating and the toxins that we put into our body are taxing our tissues , taxing our organs , nutritional deficiencies lead to fatigue , because you simply do n't have the raw"
No," materials . You need to continue to pump out the energy and then finally food sensitivities or allergens . They can lead to digestive system dysfunction , but you would n't be absorbing the nutrients that you need . It can lead to these types of deficiencies , so"
No," tenderness help . Your joint pain help your energy levels , help you sleep better , so here 's one to look at number one is eliminating sensitive foods and allergens , so take steps to identify and eliminate any food sensitivity or allergen . That might"
No," be a regular part of your diet . So some of the most common allergens in human beings are gluten and lactose , so bread , dairy , bread and dairy got ta go uh if , in that regard , so this is all you know . Carbohydrates in general are gon na get a"
No," lot of gluten out of the diet and then cutting out the dairy . If that tends to give you more energy , then you know you 're on the right track . Some of the most common uh , the common ones in these products are not only the gluten and not only the lactose itself , but they come"
No," sensitivities by simply following an antiinflammatory meal plan approach and there 's other sensitivity , food diets out there there 's histamines and things of that nature . I believe the antiinflammatory approach is the easiest . One to go about where you start"
No," to eliminate all of these types of foods , and you can slowly add specific foods or food groups back into the diet reintroduce them to see . Does it deplete my energy ? Does it increase my fatigue ? Was that a culprit and that 's how you"
No," and you can get an actual food list pick foods from That list eat those for 30 days , then start adding the foods that you love or may have used to eat back in and see what it does to your energy . The second main thing to get under control is candida ."
No," Your body , under the influence of a candida imbalance , can create constant fatigue . It 'S a common virus found in your mouth in your gut and your intestines in your skin in small amounts , and it should be there . But if it gets too much"
No," and it grows uncontrollably , it can cause a lot of infection and imbalance in the bacteria . In your gut disrupts your immune system , your body 's got to use a lot of energy fighting that off the best way to go about treating this and handling candida"
No," imbalance is to adjust . Your diet so see . Point number one once you 're on your way to adjusting that diet . You want to pay attention to carbohydrates as well any kind of refined , sugars . Some sugars may be antiinflammatory approved , but you 're going to want to tighten up and do a"
No," Off the candida , you may do a candida cleanse as well there 's resources below for you on that now . The final piece is managing your stress levels , of course , the better rest that you get , the less stress that you have uh , it 's going to be better . Your stress levels play a huge"
No, role on how tired that you are and how healthy your immune system is so some recommendations for managing these stress levels . Number one start monitoring your sleep . You can do simple apps . Now you can do simple wearables that will track your sleep throughout
No," the night . I think it 's worth doing , maybe not forever , but for a period of time to find out how much deep sleep am i getting how much rem sleep ? Am i getting ? How long does it take me to fall asleep ? The the number one predictor of better sleep is how fast you can fall asleep . Um"
No," , not you do n't want to be too quickly , but right in that 7 to 10 minute range . If you can fall asleep in that rhythm , each night you 'll get more restful sleep which is going to help you recover and lower your fatigue . Intellectual stimulation"
Environment," , cognitive uh challenges , whether it 's a game or a brain , teaser communication conversations . You want to get some brain stimulation . That 'S going to help to fatigue regular exercise super important"
No," , i like 10 minute workouts , high intensity , short duration , uh , meditation prayer , calming of them of the mind and mental wellness and just being aware and working on destressing your system also very important and then fostering and"
No," maintaining A social network and being around other people also avoid tobacco avoid alcohol . Those are gon na make your stress , worse . They'Re , gon na make your sleep worse . So there 's some tips to control chronic fatigue . Three major areas to be breaking down : eliminate the"
No," foods that you 're sensitive to antiinflammatory approach , get the sugars down and combat candida with those specific foods and then finally , keep your stress levels . Low start monitoring your sleep , getting better rest and you 'll , be on your way to"
No," decreasing your fatigue , increasing your energy , which is going to help you experience real health . Hopefully i made health simple there . That is my job comment below questions and like and subscribe to the page to continue to get more help like this check out the"
No," the last thing you ate did to your body And mind tell us about why this question is so important for our audience to be thinking about , because we have n't been trained to"
No," going to affect their physical and mental health in a couple hours in a couple days , in a couple weeks , in a couple Months , you know the beautiful thing about that and we often talk about it as like , strengthening the connection between"
No," employees . I know that when i start my day off in a way that actually feels good to my body , i have more focus . I have more energy . I have the ability to concentrate and give love and attention to all the"
No," things that matter . I do n't actually like thinking about health , a lot separate from our interviews and getting prepared for you know guests . Like yourself , i do n't like to think about health when it comes to my own personal life , i like to do the things that are there that allow"
No," me to step into the best energy focus and mindset . So i can give that energy to everything else . That 'S important in my life , you said something about willpower . I think it 's such an interesting topic , often when , for example , we have a craving"
No," your body 's preferred energy source . So all of your cells use glucose to do stuff , so your eye cells use it to see your ear cells to hear your brain cells to think your feet , cells to dance . It 'S your body 's energy supply"
No," and we get it through the food we eat the starchy or the sweet foods , so you might think like okay . Well , if i need energy , the more glucose , i have the better right , because that will give my body the most energy . It turns out , that 's not the case , it 's"
No," flattens our glucose curves . We see tremendous impact on our mental and physical health . You know in a matter of a few hours , it 's quite remarkable and then you might think okay , but why should i care ? Well , it turns out 90 of us"
No," , another category in addition to hunger and weight gain - and this is directly connected to that oatmeal story - is that my wife , when i first met her , she did like having oatmeal in the morning and often the oatmeal , that we Get is , there 's sugar , that 's added to it if you 're not"
No," your brain needs glucose . For energy too , the cells in your brain need glucose to think , and so your brain is actually incredibly sensitive to the amount of glucose in your body , so much so that there 's the blood brain barrier that protects your brain from all the crazy"
No," functioning . On top of that , every glucose spike creates inflammation in your body , and your brain feels inflammation . It feels the oxidative stress . It feels that it 's mitochondria are being overwhelmed by this glucose spike , and so your brain has less available energy and you just"
No," amazing so every time there 's a glucose spike glucose rushes to your cells , and it goes straight to the mitochondria , because your mitochondria are the ones that are in charge of turning glucose into energy . That 'S their job ! They'Re really good at"
No," written about that that connection . So it 's like our weight , as you said , is a protection mechanism . It 'S also an energy storage . It 'S like an extra uh charger . You know that we have for our iphone"
No," a lot of uh , it was like basically like a meditation conference that the jane community was hosting this uh religious community out of india , and i went to go , explore it and get more in touch with my roots . I had actually learned . It was the first time that i had heard somebody say"
No," , are being mistreated . You know we want to get people off of dairy they 're , mostly talking to an audience of vegetarians and they 're . All my friends are like cut out dairy . We literally do not eat anything like how the hell are . We gon na"
No," cutting out a lot of foods . That would typically be the foods that would spike you , because i was eating less processed foods right and i was just going to a more whole food diet and within a month and a half"
No," , my skin completely cleared up and everybody was like whoa . What drug are you on ? What thing did you take ? What skin cream did you have , and i tried all that stuff i tried , you know all the gels and the creams and other stuff and it was n't making a difference ."
No," So i 'm off of i went off dairy and then later on in life . I realized a few years ago that you can include high quality dairy into your diet in a way that makes sense for you . So i have a little bit of goats cheese . I have goat , kefir and uh"
No," and i had very intense surgery and for a while , the symptoms were . I was just in a lot of freaking pain like a lot of pain in my back and my legs , etc , but very quickly . My body healed because i was young and i was you know generally"
No," doing well , but then i had a lot of mental health issues . I had this thing called depressionization , which is a really weird sensation . Where you leave your body , it 's close to dissociation . It 'S it was very , very stressful . For me"
No," and i healed , i healed not only my mental health issues . I healed . My skin . My period became regular again . I was able to understand how to wake up in the morning feeling amazing . I had steady energy all day ."
No," feeling amazing and i 'm discovering all this science . So i printed out some scientific papers - and i was like i 'm gon na - show my friends , so they can feel good too , and so i i went to my friends and i was like look thomas . This study says that you should eat your food in"
No," avocado , smaller spike , and i just put them side by side , and then i started showing these images to my friends and then they got very interested . I mean humans are visual creatures and all of a sudden , they were like , oh whoa cool , and they got it , and i was like"
No," yes , i solved it , and so i kept doing it and i kept illustrating the scientific papers with my own data and my friends Started doing the hacks and they felt so much better . So then they started showing the hacks to their"
No," families and their friends and people started feeling better and then they said hey . Can you put this online somewhere because i was just texting these to my friends . These little graphs i had made um , and so i was asked to put these online , and so i"
Environment," training in the communication . In fact , they 're discouraged they 're discouraged to talk about really the practical applications of it because they do n't want to seem like an advocate . They have to say very neutral and they have to end all their statements with and we 've had"
No," makes a huge difference . In again the stickiness of us remembering things so let 's talk about a couple of those that are there and how they help us , maybe understand a context or a category . So one that i"
No," a day single meal a day at dinner , which is very common In the indian community , like my parents before they wore their glucose monitors , would have rice a big bowl of rice"
No," behavior changes , also when you tell people to not do something at all , there 's a little bit of like that child in all of us . That 'S like oh you 're , going to tell me to not do something f , you i 'm going to go and go ahead totally like that , i 'm the worst at this !"
No," now , because , unless they 're diabetic , their insurance is not going to cover a glucose monitor and it 's expensive they 're . Just looking for these simple things that are there and , as we know , heading in the right direction is"
No," a big part of the process , especially when we start talking about accessibility , there 's a whole group of people that do n't listen to podcasts that are not going to pick Up a book and that are working , two or three jobs a day just to survive . So if you can have these"
No," half , which means half the amount of inflammation half the amount of aging half the amount of weight gain , half the amount of crazy hormonal dysregulation , and you know cravings appearance in the afternoon . So"
No," spike and , as i mentioned in the beginning , when your glucose levels are steadier , your hunger hormones are steadier as well . So it 's time for dessert and you probably do n't really crave anything sweet . So maybe you just split dessert with your friends . Instead"
No," make . You feel a certain way and if you eat to keep your glucose levels steady and balanced you 're going to feel amazing , it 's going to feel like a superpower . Your body is going to become your friend and it 's going to be a whole new world ."
No," If they touch your dna , they damage it , and these damages can actually be the mutations that start the proliferation of cancer . That start those cells that are dividing endlessly and that create tumors . And you know in the studies , it 's very"
No," clear . You can see that people who eats in a way that spikes their glucose levels more have a higher risk of developing cancer , and it 's becoming i mean it 's everywhere . I think the stat is one in three children born today are gon na get cancer in their"
Environment," lifetime . It 'S everywhere and it 's very connected to our food . Now , obviously , there are other things that play you know for the development of cancer . You have the big ones like smoking , stress , lack of exercise , there 's a lot , a lot of power in"
No," better . Your sleep is going to improve , but you 're also helping longterm your body not develop cancer and other diseases . So it 's really fundamental to today and tomorrow . What 'S crazy is that uh ? You know we live in a time where if somebody goes on"
No," we have to be willing to start connecting the dots and understand that before somebody officially says just like with smoking , we knew that there was a connection Between smoking and cancer for such a long time , but finally , when the government got"
No," around to stamping and saying yes , we know you know , smoking can cause cancer we 're now 30 years . You know well beyond oh yeah , what the [ __ ] a lot of people got sick ."
No," amount of sugar in your diet . The impact is going to be positive , like there 's . There are very few downsides to this , and so in my world i would rather do these things to potentially have an amazing upside"
No," have to take two groups of people . One group feed them a sugarbased diet for 60 years and the other group not and then measure who gets cancer or not . I mean that 's , never going to happen . It 'S just never going to happen . That 'S so true , and we have to understand"
Environment," that , especially when we 're talking to our primary care provider is that , in addition to the fact that many people know on this podcast that physicians , wellintentioned do n't get a lot of education and nutrition are"
No," , including all the things that we 're talking about with diet um . Yes , i want to . I want to pivot to longevity and aging uh . I think i saw that you had an endorsement from the book from david sinclair . Is that correct ? That 'S correct , yeah ! That 'S great !"
No," for stuff because you never know they might say . Yes , so i 'm very grateful to him and all the other amazing endorsers um that have read the book and see the value in it . I think it 's really cool that we 're all on the same team and we all just want people to be happy and"
No," healthy . So it 's lovely to be part of the crew . It 'S so true , and i 'm glad you did that . I 'M glad you put yourself out there and asked for those things . It 'S a great reminder for everybody and , of course , for those who are not"
No," and sometimes , unfortunately , though , when we talk about aging , there 's a lot of focus on the next technology or this miracle drug . That 'S being worked on in the background , which i hope that those things come and even sometimes the silicone valley"
Environment," antiaging pill . But actually food is a really powerful place to start and the second one is exercise i mean exercise is the most powerful antiaging drug and if they could put it in a pill , it would be the miracle pill . So , unfortunately , a lot of times uh . You"
Environment," know antiaging is about stuff , that is , lifestyle related to be honest and peter etia actually posted this nice post on instagram . I think it was yesterday the day before showing this study that showed exactly that , that if you look at exercise"
Environment," it 's one of the most powerful antiaging drugs , you can take one of the most powerful experiences i had from wearing a glucose . A continuous glucose monitor is that it made me more accountable to my movement and my exercise ."
No," I would notice the weeks that i did n't hit my sort of goal of like three sort of high intensity . Workouts , again , that 's my goal : that 's not everybody else 's goal . I want to hit at least three high intensity workouts . I was eating the same basic diet , but my average"
Environment," um . So that 's another reason why that again , if you can afford it , i do think that experimenting at least for one month with the glucose monitor is helpful , because you start to see how all these things are connected . What was your relationship with movement and exercise"
Environment," during The workout - and i was like what 's happening - is n't this bad ? Am i supposed to avoid glucose spikes ? So is exercise bad , so i did the research And in fact , actually sometimes , when you 're exercising your body will release glucose from the"
No," liver to fuel . Your muscles , because your muscles need glucose to contract to make energy and help you lift all the heavy weights and stuff and so that spike you 're . Seeing is actually your body releasing stored glucose , and , in that case , even though the spike has the"
No," actually to use your muscles for a little bit , so your muscles need energy to contract and the fastest place the fastest way they get . Energy is from the glucose in your bloodstream . So if you 've just had a meal , that 's creating a big glucose spike . What you can do is just"
No," just ate and it 's pretty cool because oftentimes , especially after dinner , we tend to just kind of sit there . But if we just get up and move a little bit , it has a big impact on our physical and mental health , and for me it has a huge impact on how tired i feel"
No," after eating . If , instead of just sitting there , i go even for a 10minute walk , i do n't have that crash anymore , because i 'm helping my body not experience the glucose roller coaster , i 'm much steadier in how i feel for the rest of the day ."
No," Growing up , my grandparents were religious about after dinner . We 'D all go on a walk around the neighborhood and i thought it was the weirdest thing you know you 're walking around with your entire family around the neighborhood , and it was a beautiful thing . Looking"
No," everybody feel better and even my grandmother , one time told me on my dad 's side that it 'll help you sleep better too and again i did n't know is this like just like you"
No," know home remedies . You know old wives , tales . Other stuff , but i think that she was onto something she was onto something and she knew that if we can bring our blood sugar back in balance , it impacts our sleep and you 've written about this a little bit yeah and you"
No," How does getting good quality sleep play into this conversation , so the biggest impact i see the biggest relationship between sleep and glucose is for one . If you go to sleep with a big glucose spike happening in your body . If you go to bed in that state , you 're going"
No," tempting , because when we 're tired , we just feel like oh sugar 's , going to give me energy actually sugar 's , not going to give you energy sugar is going to overwhelm your mitochondria . Your mitochondria are going to shut down and are not going to be able to give you the"
No," energy you need . We feel that sugar gives us energy , because it makes us feel pleasure in our brain , but that 's not the same thing as actually your body having energy . Another good one to come back to the muscles ."
No," groups from your diet . It 'S really additive stuff , which is what i love so much about this philosophy : we 're not taking away anything we 're just adding fun easy cool habits that have a huge impact on how you 're , gon na"
No," get there . That was my experience , so i know it for a fact , but it 's really important and at the beginning of the podcast you said something about zeitgeist and i really hope that all these hacks will just become part of our culture , and everybody"
No," everything else i share . That 'S my that 's my hope . That 'S my hope , as well and you 're a major contributor to that . I want to run through if you have a little bit more time , a few other categories that people start to unpack"
No," cappuccinos make your own cool little blended , coffee drink in the morning . That does n't include sugar , because , fundamentally , the the shape of your breakfast curve is going to impact so severely the rest of"
No," your day . It is incredible , it 's very important to get this right , because it 's completely going to change how you feel for the rest of the day and my philosophy for breakfast is sugars and starches at breakfast should be for taste"
No," switch , do whole milk . Do almond milk . I mean nothing 's perfect , but in terms of your glucose levels , oat milk is is not the best choice . Yeah , it 's really tough . I will say anecdotally from the friends that i 've"
No," gifted glucose monitors to and the family members you know generally , they all have like compared to the standard american diet or the process . To you know world diet that 's out there . They generally have are headed way more in the right"
No," , but then get a glucose monitor to actually see if it ends up working jesse . What about the category of alcohol ? How do we think about alcohol ? Do you drink alcohol yourself and um ? You know , there 's a few layers to alcohol ."
No," We know that alcohol is n't a health food so to speak right and that there are links to a lot of different conditions that are out there , but a lot of people do enjoy alcohol socially , i 'm one of those individuals ."
No, What have we seen when it comes to the topic of glucose and alcohol and um any kind of caveats that you would add to that conversation around alcohol ? So i would just start off by saying that there 's no health benefits to drinking
No," alcohol . It 'S not something ! That 'S good for your body , it 's difficult for your liver to process , and so when you do drink alcohol think about it . This way think : okay , i 'm already giving alcohol to my body to process . Let 'S avoid , on top of that"
No," , giving it a glucose spike , because then it has to deal with the alcohol and the glucospike , and that 's just a lot for your liver to handle . So here are the things that you can drink if you 're drinking alcohol that do not"
No," , etc , and then you know hard alcohols are also fine from mugduco 's perspective . However , the real kicker here is the mixers . So , if you 're having gin , for example , there 's a massive difference between a gin tonic and a gin soda"
No," , a gin tonic contains extra sugar in the tonic . A gin soda does n't so when you 're mixing hard alcohols with other things . Try to think okay , what 's not going to be too sweet , so the goto that everybody likes and enjoys is soda water with lime or lemon . That 'S a really easy one to be"
No," honest , but then , if you go for cocacola , if you go for fruit juices , i mean all of that is going to create a glucose spike . So what you can do is use your muscles dance . Usually , when we drink alcohol , we like to dance so highly , encourage dancing"
No," about them , but all in all you know also when we drink alcohol . We know that it 's for pleasure and not for health , so it might be one of those cases where you just kind of drink . Whatever do you like and another thing connecting it back to"
No," the beginning . Part of the conversation is that i 've noticed over the years . I 'M turning 40 this year is that as i 've cleaned up my diet , one , i need to drink way less to feel any sort of you know buzz or things like that . Uh"
No," number two uh , because you are so sensitive and you so enjoy your baseline is health , and you feel so good when you wake up first thing in the morning when you 've cleaned up your diet and balanced your blood sugar"
No," get addicted to feeling really good . So you start to wind down and cut down , so in the past it used to be . I never was a big alcohol drinker to begin with . I did n't really start drinking wine until i was in my like mid20s um"
No," and whenever i would have it i 'd say : okay , maybe a glass or two and it 'd be a couple times a month . Now i still am on about the couple times a month . If i 'm out socially , i just went out with a friend uh with my wife and uh . He invited us to his restaurant here in"
No," try this and i was like you know what i 'm with friends . I would love to try it and i was really worried the wine tasted great , but i naturally saw myself not drinking as much like . I do n't even feel i do n't even feel finished the whole glass sometimes now , because i still"
No," enjoy it . I , like the taste of it , i like the romance of it . I like the feeling of it , but i do n't even need to finish it to feel good or to feel anything . So i 've just naturally cut down the amount of alcohol . That 'S there . We also did a big"
No," episode with dr richard johnson who 's , one of the world 's experts in uric acid , and he wanted to remind our audience that sure wine in certain alcohols do n't spike glucose , but there 's a mechanism where"
No," they can actually cause your body to produce its Own fructose , through uric acid , which has other downstream consequences so for all my friends that are posting on instagram after drinking that bot , you know that glass of wine or three or whatever"
No," , you can start drawing wrong conclusions . You can think that , for example , alcohol is good for me because it does n't spike my glucose levels or eating something . Incredibly , fatty is good for me because it does n't spike my glucose levels , because , if you put enough"
Environment," fat on something it 'll keep your glucose levels steady , but it wo n't be good for you um . So i think context is very important . Education is very important . I hope that anybody out there who wears a glucose monitor is thinking about . It will also"
Environment," like - Is exercise bad for me and wine is good for me , like i do n't understand so it 's complicated glucose is not everything . Glucose is a really powerful lever to start with , but it is not everything you also have to think about other stuff . You know relationships"
No," , medical care , sleep happiness stress , but in my experience , if you get your glucose levels under control , as you just said , all these other things start falling into place . You do n't actually want to drink that much anymore , because you wake"
No," So walk us through a day on the life of uh , glucose goddess and by the way uh do you have a term for the men that want to identify inside of your community ? Is it a glucose homie , a glucose bro like what do you call the god"
No," and as a result , i Feel amazing , i do n't have hunger at 11 am and my energy is super steady then i would probably add to that a whole milk cappuccino and then i would go to work or wherever i 'm going , and i try to avoid snacking too much in the morning , because One i 'm"
No," i 'll have the cake that i bought or the cookie that i Bought um and then i will go for a walk after lunch 100 and then in the evening . Let 'S say i 'm having friends over , for example , um i 'll"
No," starches , i love starches in the evening . They just make me feel really cozy and nice and warm so whether it 's potatoes or pasta or rice . You know , i know , to eat the starches after the veggies , the proteins and the fats and by now my friends also know to do this"
No," and then a dessert . Let 'S say maybe like some strawberries and some clotted cream or like maybe some pastries , i made something like that and then i 'll take all my friends and i 'll go for a walk with them around the block , as your grandmother does , because that"
No," way , when everybody comes back , They actually have energy and they want to help me clean up the house . It 'S a trick very good trick , that 's a sample day , but you know , obviously it changes every day and some"
No," i hope soon in the lives of everybody , listening well jesse , it 's been a fantastic episode and i so appreciate your commitment to making this work accessible and also fun . Fun is a important part of this process ."
No," Just hearing you walk through your day , there was a resounding feeling of well that not only seems doable , but it feels like fun because you 're integrating your friends , you guys are walking together . You are slowing down"
No," that you want to present to people in this world where health can feel so all or nothing . I think the allornothing mentality leads to suffering and it leads to guilt and it often does n't work because if we do something , that 's so"
No," challenging and difficult like cutting out carbohydrates entirely from our diet or doing some sort of complicated , very restrictive new lifestyle . It does n't make us happy and we ca n't sustain it . So really . What we 're looking"
No," remove all the guilt that they might have accumulated around eating , carbs or feel guilty or feel like they do n't have enough willpower like i feel like this is the way and the resounding message i get from people who Started playing the hacks , is they tell me they 've"
No," reconnected with their body and they feel , like their body , is their friend now and instead of beating their body up and being like , why do n't you look this way ? Why do i feel like this ? The relationship shifts and they 're able to find that happiness again"

No," , the heartbeating fast , if they 're other than that . What happens is people usually mistake them uh for other symptoms and and then they get caught in a cycle of trying to work them out and being then , then , that sort of makes health ocd often feel worse"
No," , because you think this is a real thing . This is different , and so on . So what happens with these ? If we , if we look at some of the physical symptoms , i 'm going to go through , some of them is when you 've had now you 've been anxious for a very long time . Obviously"
Environment," happened is , i would have say , for example , very bad , neck pain , right and , i would sort of say . Oh , that was just from the gym or whatever , but it was n't it was the muscles in the neck were latched on and tightened up , because uh the anxiety was firing that up , even though at that point"
Environment," in time i was n't triggered or felt latched in an anxiety Loop , the nervous system was still firing up , so i used to get very bad neck pain that used to hurt a lot when i was working out in the gym , made it difficult to sleep but i 'll go through the body very quickly about some"
No," of the physical Symptoms that people can experience and why they are usually often mistaken and people go down all kinds of routes , then trying to investigate them in great depth when they do n't actually need that they need leaving and just carrying on with life"
No," but um , but getting more comfortable With them and seeing them come up rise and fall , the sort of peaks and troughs of the physical anxiety . So if we look at the body and i 'll start from the head um , you can obviously you can get really tight"
No," jaw pain . I used to get tmj , which is a very tight muscles in here , which used to give a sort of clonking sound in the jaw and then , when i used to eat it used to feel like the jaw was coming out of place on each one and biting Used to feel like it"
No," was all off and not on center , so that used to happen . I used to get very bad hay fever , uh , really bad symptoms of hay fever . I used to get a dry eye very bad dry eyes from anxiety , uh . I used to get very bad rosacea that"
No," used to come up from anxiety uh . All of these things from anxiety . I do n't need to say that because going through it , but some of them were obviously genetically predispositioned anyway , so and already did n't have had some skin conditions . Like eczema that were then exasperated"
No," by anxiety much further , so things like rosacea was made more prominent um things like a pale , very pale skin uh that always almost felt translucent because uh and i could see all the veins very blue in my arms and so on . Because i because it that anxiety used to do that"
No," in relation to circulation , um , then coming down obviously very bad neck pain um . Then i used to have what other things did . I have i had very bad um . I had very bad tightness , uh of of muscles . In the stomach"
No," like they were happening on their own um , then i used to have um just constant sweating , uh , constant hot and cold sensations , uh aching joints , elbows , hands , fingers , uh , very bad aching joints . When i used to work out , i used to think god . This is"

No," Longterm financial goals can sometimes seem so big that they feel almost unattainable especially when we’re just getting started on our road to financial independence. I and many others like me in the financially independent, retired early community have found it helpful to break down the goal of becoming financially independent into smaller and more manageable levels of financial independence. Not only because it makes it easier for us to track our progress, which in turns helps us to stay motivated throughout the process, but also because it helps us get over that"
Environment," initial hurdle of starting to chip away at this mountain of a task. In today’s video, I’m going to take you through what I consider to be the 10 levels of financial independence as well as give an example on how to go from the first level to the top level in your lifetime. Hey everyone Daniel here and welcome to Next Level Life a channel where you can learn about Investing, debt, retirement, and many other general financial education videos because the school's aren't going to do it for us."
No," So if any of those topics sound interesting to you or if you want to learn how to better handle your money and have more financial freedom be sure to hit that subscribe button and the bell next to my name to be notified every time I upload a video. And if you want to further support the growth of this channel you can check out some of the links I’ve left down in the description below which includes a 30day free trial of Audible and 2 free audiobooks of your choice as well as a list of some books on money I’d recommend checking out, or you can share this video with a friend, and leave a comment below"
Environment," I’ve left some links in the description. With that out of the way, let’s get started. Okay so real quick the 10 levels of financial Independence are Level 0 Financial dependence, level 1 Financial solvency, level 2 Financial stability, level 3 debt Freedom, level four coasting Financial Independence (also sometimes known as freedom from employer), level 5 Financial Security, level six Financial flexibility, level 7 Financial independence, level eight Financial Freedom, and finally level 9 Financial abundance."
Environment," The levels are usually defined as something like the following: Level 0 Financial dependency is when your debt payments and other living expenses are greater than your own income. This means that you are in one way or another dependent on someone or something else to help you pay for your bills or if you happen to be a kid and don't actually have any bills you need someone else, usually your parents, to pay to put food on the table and keep the lights on and have a roof over your head."
Environment," So in a sense, you've worked really really hard and been very frugal in the first few years so that you can coast into your retirement. I have gone into more detail on the various types of financial Independence in a previous video which I'll leave Linked In the description if you're interested in learning more. Level 5 Financial Security is effectively when your cash flow from wealth such as you are investments has grown to large enough that it can provide for your annual basic survival expenses."
No," Now I say survival expenses because I do differentiate that from living expenses survival expenses are just the basic things you need to survive Food, Water, Shelter, some form of transportation, clothing and probably insurance. This does not include things like Netflix subscriptions or cable bills or things like that it is purely survival expenses. So this may not be exactly the ideal spot to retire and I certainly wouldn't want to retire at this point but it is an important level to keep in mind because it does give"
Environment, you well security. If you were to get fired today and you were on level 5 you would be okay you could survive until you found another job. This is essentially the first level that really gives you I guess that piece of mind even if the lifestyle should you have chosen to live it may not be the most lavish. Level 6 Financial flexibility is similar to Financial Security just one step up.
Environment," In all they have credit card debt, two car payments and the student loans which have balances of $5,000, $35,000, and $60,000 respectively, but since they got their jobs they are no longer financially dependent and their incomes have allowed them to become current on all their debt payments without the help of others. In addition to the regular monthly debt payments, their annual expenses are $48,000 a year. So they are currently in level one Financial solvency and trying to figure out a way to move to level 2 Financial stability."
No," much money they need to survive not necessarily on their current level of expenses while they have jobs but purely on Survival expenses which are basically your four walls of your financial house or in other words food shelter including utilities Basic clothing and some form of transportation as well as the insurances that are related to that assuming there are any. In this case, I'm going to assume that their survival expenses are right around $3,000 a month."
Environment," Which means that in order to get a 3month emergency fund they would need $9,000 in order to get a sixmonth emergency fund they would need to save $18,000. Both John and Jane feel that their jobs are pretty darn secure and the market is doing fairly well so it's not likely at least in the nearterm that they would get laid off because the company has to downsize so they decide together that they are comfortable with having just a 3month emergency fund of $9,000. So with $83,200 a year in income, $48,000 a year and expenses, plus minimum monthly"
Environment," And as it turns out thankfully there are many. After taking a look at the options they decide that they're going to work as much overtime as they possibly can (for the sake of Simplicity I'm going to assume that they manage to work on average 5 hours per week of overtime which will increase their monthly income by about $1,300 a month, meaning that instead of $1,660 a month they will have $2,960 a month left over) and they're going to sell both of their cars and buy some nice used cars with cash to help knock down some of that initial debt."
No," After putting out a couple of ads online they managed to find buyers for each of their cars that is willing to give them $15,000. So they take that $30,000 and use $5,000 of it to pay off the credit card balance and another $10,000 to buy a couple of used cars from someone that they know takes good care of their Vehicles whether that be a family friend or just a mechanic that they Trust. The remaining $15,000 is thrown at their car loans. This means that the credit card loan is fully paid off and therefore the hundreddollar"
Environment," Meaning that in theory, they would be able to step down from their jobs to a more rewarding less stressful but probably lowerpaying job just 3 years and 10 months into their financial Journey. That is incredible! But like I said coasting Financial Independence wasn't their end goal. They wanted to be fully Financial Independent so they keep working and investing for now. The next level is level 5 Financial Security which is achieved when your cash flow from"
Environment," your Investments is greater than your annual survival expenses which remember is $3,000 a month or $36,000 a year in John and James case. Because they are debtfree, are making good money at their jobs, and being intentional with their finances they Achieve Financial Security in a little over 4 years with over $367,000 in their portfolio. It is been a mere 87 months or 7 years and 3 months since they began their financial Journey."
Environment," John and Jane are 30 years old and they are able to get by on their Investments alone. In theory, they could retire now, it wouldn't be the most glamorous retirement and it wasn't their goal but it is an option they have. They don't have to worry about losing their jobs anymore because even if both of them lost their jobs today they would be able to make it long enough to either find a new job or some other source of income. This is really the first level where you start to get that piece of mind when it comes to"
No," money at least in my opinion. Next is financial flexibility which as I mentioned earlier in the video has many definitions depending on who you ask but for the purposes of this video, I'm assuming that it is roughly 12.5x your current annual expenses which for John and Jane would be roughly $600,000 or about $855,000 if you account for inflation. This means that they would Achieve Financial flexibility 9 years and 8 months into their Journey not accounting for inflation or about 11 years and 9 months if we do account for"
No," Well technically yes but the reason I split them up is because in my experience taking this journey myself as well as seeing others take it, this journey changes how you view a lot of things and more often than not those changes lead to you valuing things such as freedom of mobility and location and freedom of time to be able to spend with the people you love more and valuing more material things that cost possibly a lot of money less and less. That's not to say that everybody becomes minimalist going through this journey, I'm not saying"
No," that at all but I have seen a lot of people who have gone through this journey become closer to minimalist than they were when they started the journey as they find out more and more things that they used to buy just don’t provide enough value or happiness for them to be worth the purchase. They find better uses for their money and time and as a result, they generally tend to spend less. Which means that even though inflation is technically increasing your expenses by making"
No," every dollar less and less valuable over time, if you're also decreasing your expenses because what you value is changing it may even out or in some cases, you may even see your regular expenses going down yearoveryear as you continue through this journey. So that's why I split them up. And, before I go, I do want to mention that based on what I've seen on various articles and forums some people really like to have even more goals to chase as they go through this journey than what I've laid out today in this video so if that's something that"
No," and hit that Bell next to my name so that you'll be notified of all my future uploads. I generally upload every single Monday, and if you have a friend that would be interested in this kind of content be sure to share it with them and let's really get this information out there and start our own Financial revolution."
No," make a difference . Vote with your dollars and get involved today , here 's your host karina , belizzi , hello , fellow dogooders and friends : i 'm your host karina belizzi , an activist and cause marketer who 's , passionate about social impact and sustainability ."

Environment," chronic diseases are actually preventable , um and largely through a healthy diet and exercise in good sleep and managing stress . And yet what ?"
No," of year . In fact , i think the average household spends more than four hundred dollars on a single child 's gift . It 'S it 's a little bit insane so uh . I think the expectation has even become"
No," i mentioned with That i think it 's uh , we have about three percent of the world 's children in in the us , and yet we have about 40 percent of the toys . So so it just kind of speaks to the fact that we we are , you know vastly over consuming"
No," , let go of it . And so then they pay for storage and the storage fees , pile up yeah , my mother , paid for one . For years and years after we left oregon and we ended up paying a friend to go and review it all and do a garage sale and"
Environment," being you know , really aggressive , but you know really . This opens up the possibility of putting away at least 30 percent , perhaps 70 of your income into investing and"
No," i absolutely love what you are doing , because you know financial independence does not mean that you then sit back and retire and take back and do nothing . I hope that people find the things that they 're passionate about and when they 're passionate about"
Environment," employment today looks like so the typical person today in today 's economy is sitting at a job from eight to five um , largely tied to a computer , followed by sitting through traffic to and from work"
Environment," , and so that leaves one . You know one . Your have almost no exercise there , it 's completely sedentary and two um oftentimes uh folks are rushed and they do n't have time for an adequate"
No," meal that you prepare for dinner for you and your family . It just does n't happen . People do n't have the energy by the end of that time , to to be able to do all that , and so you know what i 'd like to suggest . Is that really is a better way of living"
No, they hear is a burgeoning field and they 're going to get in and it 's going to be wide open and then they graduate college four years later and the dynamics have shifted and there 's covid and and yeah i mean especially if you 're Swamped
Environment," their own right , um , there 's a lot of stance , medical issues , snapping medically any number of things that um you know some people just have very little income for whatever reason there are some folks that will not get to That point of"
No," that um helps you sleep better at night . If nothing else , you know , maybe you have a little bit of cushion . If , maybe you do n't have to work that second job , there is some degree of uh liberation , even then even then uh just by being mindful of"
No," being a mindful consumer or of not doing well enough because you 're , comparing to what someone else has as opposed to what Thinking what about what you have and what you can be thankful for . So i wondered if you had some"
No," perspective , to offer on that in particular , and then i would also like to get into the types of investments that are perhaps , let 's just say , friendly for someone who 's just getting started or thinking"
No," think about these things as essential , but that um in the depression era . It was n't that way like they were n't considered essential items like you might not have them exactly right . I mean you know and um . Adam smith , uh"
No," , um and then looking at how else i might invest . I honestly have n't taken the time to educate myself and investigate what i might want to do . I'Ve heard about mutual funds . I'Ve been thinking about something that 's more environmentally based , that 's kind of in line with the constructs of"
No," um ! You know . Basically , it comes down to live well within your means and then invest the rest . Okay , and so that 's it . That 'S any uh . You could read uh hundreds of financial books and"
No," there 's a time value to money like this is something we spent a bit of time learning about when i was getting my mba at santa clara right and the fact is that uh , you know you have inflation happening at A rate that 's actually higher than a bank"
No," account standard bank account savings account yield would be so even if you 're swirling , money away and you 're just putting it in an account you 're afraid to spend it um , it 's actually losing value with time . It 'S worth less next year than it was"
No," i 'm kind of just been afraid to make those investments so um . If you were to give advice to somebody like me , who might have a little bit of fear about investing . What might you say"
No," grow over time . That 'S real , simple and that right there is probably 90 of it . Okay , so the rest is just kind of finetuning . You ca n't go wrong if you , if you , if you started with that , okay . Well , i um . I have a few friends who"
No," , and yet we do n't have to be this way right , there 's really a much better way out there . That again , you know , i hope folks are listening out . There will will be persuaded about and um , and you know again uh . This has huge implications in terms of"
No," in my husband 's employer , joby aviation who just went public this um this summer . So we 're looking at that - and i think i will just put some money aside and some some basic indexed funds , because it 's not very risky and it will help secure a future and possibly even"
Environment," pay for that education . For my kids , because that 's the one thing that i think is tough right now : um saving for their education um is the thing that i 'm i 'm pretty much . I'Ve got my sights on at this point . There are some excellent 529 uh plans"
Environment," , which are college savings plans out there that everybody should be uh , hopefully um looking into as well . That can you know , get you to that that level of security that you need so yeah . My motherinlaw put it"
No," this way , though , save for yourself and retirement first and then the children , because if you have to cover your own expenses later in life , then they 're just expected to cover yours . So i think he 's right . It 'S just um ! You know . If you kick the"
No," that i have n't asked that you wish i had um and if not then , let 's just sum up and give our listeners that one thing that They should walk into their days . Thinking about yeah um . You know , i hope to convey and and again i i want to"
Environment," some way right , um , so exercise . For example , it engages your body or um . You know , reading a book right . Those are things that engage in mind and make you think about things listening to podcasts"
No," things like that um those things uh , which are you know again , largely free of cost that are are available to us spending time with family and friends um . You know , i hope that you know when we"
Environment," , you know once again , the the book is called health in flames . A doctor 's prescription for living beyond diet and exercise you can find out more information on the website healthinflamescom ."
No, I hope you guys read the book and i i 'm convinced that it will benefit you and for those of you who are interested in in getting to bringing that benefit to the next level to societal level .
No," Uh there 's a place on the website where you can contact me and indicate your interest and i hope , to work with some of y'all to um to build a better society . So look forward to that . Well , one more thing i 'll say about the"
No," for working to ingrain the learnings and try to move forward and into change . So thanks for doing that , i think it 's an incredible book . I also like reading audiobooks , as i 'm out there enjoying the outdoors i 'm kind of an audiophile , so i 'll just put a"
Environment," now you understand that living a little bit more frugally . Just by doing that , you can be help happier , you can be healthier , you can live with greater purpose . You can have a little bit more security . You can understand that you 've got more money"

Environment," may vary in particular , becoming consumer debt free or reaching your first one hundred thousand . This is because no two personal finance journeys are the same . Personal finance is just that personal . The first stage is dependence in this stage , a person 's income that they make"
Environment, disclaimer in the description box below the next stage is break . Even this stage is characterized as living paycheck to paycheck . This means that a person 's income is just enough to cover their living expenses without any money left over after each pay period . The next
Environment," stage is budget optimization . In this stage , a person is moving away from living from paycheck to paycheck and are starting to look at ways to find some surplus cash . This could involve auditing and decreasing expenses or looking at ways to increase income , so ideally"
Environment," stage is a fully funded emergency fund . The general rule here is three to six months worth of living expenses . However , this number can be personal to a person 's situation and the stability of a person 's income list gets loaded . Did a cool guide to work out how much a person"
Environment, the time . I'Ll leave a link to the video that i made in the description . The next stage is fu money . Fu money is having enough saved and invested that a person can walk away from a job or situation without having to worry about finding income straight away . The amount needed
No," enter so for us . I added in our fire number and a growth rate of five percent . Normally , i would do seven percent , but i wanted to be super conservative for this , and then we have 195 years until my husband is 60 and can access his retirement account . I will need to redo"
No," this number soon , as someone is having a birthday . The next stage is for lingo phi , it 's a form of semiretirement , a person works fulltime until they reach 50 of their fire number . They then switch to parttime for approximately 10 years and thanks to the rule of 72 , with a 7 return"
Environment," is generally a person 's annual , essential expenses without any fun money . A very lean budget to calculate it 's simply essential expenses , multiplied by 25 and now , of course , standard fire standard fire is saving and investing as much as your income as possible . Until you reach"
No," Right , so imagine a future where you do n't have to work a job that you do n't enjoy . You might choose to work , but you 'd be doing it on your own terms . You can spend your time doing the things that you want working on your hobbies , connecting with your friends and family"
No," work and work , and then eventually at the age of 65 or 70 , you then retire , and I thought that this concept had been around for ages but actually turns out . It was invented in 1889 by the German Chancellor , Otto von Bismarck and our friend Otto realized that Germany at the"
No," a parttime job as a doctor to be able to do these mini retirements , to be able to travel the world kind of spread out throughout my life . But then , over time , as I 've had more financial success through the businesses through the YouTube channel through the other stuff that I 'm"
No," The reason we call it work is because we are sacrificing something generally . Most of us do n't work for fun , we 're sacrificing something for the sake of making money , we 're trading our life energy for money , so that in the future we can then enjoy the money that we"
No," generate from our work . And yes , of course , work has all these other benefits , bloody blood , etc , etc . But , generally , if you ask most people , if you won the lottery , would you still do your job for fun ? Most people would say no , probably not or I 'd go parttime . If you ask most people"
No," fire is where you 're , financially independent and you have loads and loads of money , because you 've made loads of money from stuff and you 've put it into fairly safe Investments and there 's a concept in the fire Community called the four percent rule , which is the idea that"

Environment," retirement , which is basically where the work that you 're doing to generate income , is the work that you 'd be doing for free anyway . This is where you work with doing what you love and therefore you never have to work a day in your life and it sounds kind of cliche and"
Environment," to reduce my lifestyle costs and thirdly , I want to make sure that the work I 'm doing for active income is the work that I would be doing anyway and the work that I would enjoy . So , let 's break these down a little bit more in detail , and hopefully you can get some tips on how"
No," you might want to approach this as well for whatever that 's worth so . Firstly , with the make lots of money and put it into assets thing , there 's a concept in Rich Dad , Poor , Dad called the the cash flow quadrants or something like that . Basically , the idea is that , initially"
Environment," fulltime as doctors Or parttime as doctors and are building up the side hustles alongside because they recognize the value of having multiple streams of income . So I know a bunch of friends who are doctors who have YouTube channels , for example , and they also do the making"
Environment," courses thing and writing . Ebooks thing and that 's great because now you 're making some amount of active income from your day job as a doctor or a consultant or investment banker or whatever but you 're , making the side income over time and hopefully eventually that will get"
No," chilling on a beach doing nothing because that 's boring and a recipe for depression and burnout and stuff , but then the followup question from that is okay . Once I figured out what I would be doing once I figured out what does my ideal ordinary week actually look like ?"
No," If I was n't worried about money , then it 's about figuring out , okay cool , given that retirement is not about not working , it 's about actually doing the work that you want to do . How much does it actually cost to have a lifestyle where I am just reading , writing learning and teaching"
No," and generally the answer is nowhere near 100 million like I do n't need fancy stuff to make me particularly happy . I just need my laptop nice coffee shop , nice cup of coffee and by hand and broadly doing work I enjoy I Reading , Writing , learning and teaching and"
No," hanging out with my friends and family and then the other question that I ask myself is when I look at My calendar , what are the activities in my calendar that energize me that give me energy and what are the activities in my calendar that drain me that drain my energy and"
No," then for the ones that drain my energy ? I try and either figure out a way to make it enjoyable or figure out a way to not have to necessarily do the thing . So that 's how I 'm personally thinking about the idea of retiring early and , if you 're interested in potentially trying to do"
Environment," In this video we're going to look at some of the major benefits, both physical and mental, that an exercise program can bring to your life. Let's start with the physical benefits. Number one, cardiovascular and respiratory improvement. Over time, you end up strengthening the cardiac muscle that surrounds your heart, you also pump a greater volume of blood with each stroke, which causes a decrease in resting heart rate, you develop a lot more red blood cells, which improves your ability to bring oxygen to your muscles, and your lungs become stronger and better at supplying your body with the oxygen it needs. Number two, reduction in health risk factors. Regular exercise can reduce"
Environment," your risk of cardiovascular disease, developing type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Research also shows that active people have a lower risk of colon and breast cancer, and regular exercise can also increase your chances of living longer. Number three, increased metabolic rate. Metabolic rate is the rate at which your body burns calories. During exercise, you obviously burn more calories than when at rest, however, your metabolic rate at rest is enhanced even after your workout session is completed, as your body uses energy to repair muscle and replenish ATP storage and glycogen storage. This does depend on several factors, including the intensity of"
Environment," the exercise and your current fitness level. Number four, decreased risk of falls. Incorporating balance, coordination and muscle strengthening activities into your exercise program can improve your motor skills, thus reducing the risk of falling. Number five, bone health improvement. Impact activities, such as plyometrics and jumping, and resistance training, can slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Playing sports that involve running and jumping can be advantageous as well. Number six, weight loss and reduced obesity. Physical activity can be a key part of a complete weight management plan to avoid excessive fat gain, and to maintain a healthy"
Environment," weight. Regular exercise burns more calories and increases muscle mass, both of which are key to weight loss and weight maintenance. Now let's take a look at the mental benefits. Number one, increased feelings of wellbeing. Exercising enhances the action of endorphins and enkephalins, which improve natural immunity, and reduce the perception of pain. Regular exercise can also improve mood, feelings of having more energy, and overall quality of life. Number two, better sleep. Research has shown that regular exercise helps people fall asleep faster and enjoy a deeper sleep, it can also improve sleep duration, and decrease middleofthenight wake up's, providing"
Environment," a better overall sleep quality. Number three, better brain function. Regular exercise can reduce fatigue, which can improve alertness and concentration, physical activity improves blood circulation, which delivers oxygen to the brain at a faster pace, which leads to sharper thinking. Number four, increased selfesteem. Regular exercise can improve your body shape, increasing your confidence in your appearance, thus increasing your selfesteem.

Environment, The American Heart Association is out with a new warning on the dangers of too much sitting . It says that even bursts of exercise may not undo the risk from a sedentary lifestyle . The read the review pound adults set an average of six to eight hours a day .
Environment," People are more than 60 move around even less dr Tara . Narula is here Tara good morning , good morning charlie , so we should stand up . All message for a lot of people has been as long as I get in my exercise . It 'S okay ! If I 'm sitting 15 hours of the rest of the day and some of"
Environment," the research has shown that , in fact , if you do exercise , you can attenuate some of the problems that come with sitting . But this new statement really says that , regardless of how much exercise you do , you can not undo the harms of sitting and that we need to think about these as two"
Environment," distinct entities sitting and exercise that work through two different mechanisms and have different health consequences attenuate . This surprises me because I 'm one of those people I exercise , but I have this handydandy Under Armour band , that starts vibrating ."
Environment," If I 've been sitting too long right , it says 60 minutes and I 'm thinking what is what is so bad if you 're already doing the exercise , what does it do for your body if you do n't get up and walk around so in 1953 ? One of the first studies came out that showed that London bus drivers"
Environment," your normal pattern of you have a ratio of you should sit X amount then move XML , so the recommendations for exercise remain and that 's 150 minutes a week of moderateintensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes a week of vigorous exercise . Unfortunately , we do n't have the research"

No, your primary care and learning hey agp learners . Thank you for joining us on this lovely saturday morning and we are going to be going through basically the headline stuff about the pc endeavors contractor 20222023 : we 're going to go through the main
Environment," desk , but this is a comment from liz hair asking us about when our next training the trainers conference is so just let you know that is imminent . It 'S on the 14th of may and that 's our collaboration with tara jones and we 're going to be having an amazing conference on the 14th"
Environment," of may loads of content . I get to show how board games work in general practice , training um , so yeah . If you want to see that as well as loads of other amazing speakers definitely join us and the links for that again we 'll put down below . But if you search for"
No," amount . They are reminding us of that um they 're , reminding us , and it 's interesting that this is a specific point in the cover letter they 're , reminding us that there 'll be the opportunity to employ a second mental health practitioner within each"
No," they recognize there is massive shortage in the mental health workforce capacity . So we 're trying to , i think , maybe polarize people think this is one potential to focus on um . I think it 's important to um . It says on a 50 50 shared reimbursement scheme"
No," and the really interesting part is one word . That 'S changed is to come from , should to can so does this mean that actually networks do n't have to necessarily share it with the mental health care trust and the reason why i say that i know locally in"
No," But the fact that that one word has changed , i think , is potentially interesting and i absolutely would encourage nhs england to clarify . Does this mean , unlike last year , networks had to share it with the mental health care trust ? Do they still have to do that ? For"
No," picked up on that gandhi , uh , but you 're right should and can do have very different meanings . So maybe there 'll be some increased flexibility for primary care networks to employees without a mental health trust which will be really really"
No," like the network managers , that many networks are now big enough to necessarily need , and we 've Talked previously about the value of that you know , tara humphreys has talked massively about then has her own course to help new network managers in terms of"
No," I 'M thinking not , i think , as long as you 're providing some that should satisfy the criteria of the contract . Absolutely clear : i 'm not an interesting one , but yeah yeah it 's difficult , and clarification will be really really"
No," services . So i i remember it took me a long time to actually get this straight in my head , what they were talking about because for us gps , anticipatory care we 're often thinking about endoflife care , but that 's not what this particular"
No," not looked in deep in the document , i guess some of it might be about transfer of people who might be on warfarin or more older treatments for those conditions and might be better suited to go back and moving them across . That 'S we 're just"
No," decisions . It 'S very rare for these , even nice generally do not recommend individual drugs for particular conditions and stuff . It tends to be groups of drugs . However , nhs england have specifically specified that it should be edoxaband , that is , there is a criteria to"
No," pipe thing , so we unveiled this in our previous episode um . If you do want to send a message to us where you can tell us what you actually think and literally tell us , then go to speakpipecom egp learning with the g and the p in capitals and you 'll be able to record"
No," had one about mental health workers um . So where are we here ? We go so um . Let 'S bring that on the screen . So rocky roger are your mhps on 30 minute appointments . It does limit the number they can see . Well , mental health consultations are longer"
No," generally speaking and they are a different level of intensity and different level of qualifications that they do in terms of gdps and stuff um , so actually 30 minutes for a fullblown mental health consultation"
Environment," depending what you 're doing actually may not be A bad thing , particularly as a new content , i think it 's a review - may not necessarily be needed , probably drop down to 20 i 'll do matching , but it does depend on training stuff . I think it really depends on what you 're asking"
No," your mental health practitioners to do , because i know in our area we um . We spoke with the practices and stakeholders and sort of identified that uh there were people who uh slipped between the gaps between our iap services and improving access to"
No, psychology therapy services in our local mental health team and sort of step . Four counseling yeah people sort of fell between that gap and we really wanted people . We wanted the mental health practitioner to focus on those people and actually what we find is
No," those people are falling between that gap for all sorts of reasons . It 'S often because they 're very very difficult to help people um that do n't necessarily the criteria for specific mental health services , but nonetheless , are really"
No, long in those situations . I think it 's that difference between first contact mental health practitioners versus mental health practitioners used to manage the localized challenges . The practice may face - and this is definitely different to what we were originally
No," them . I mean um uh , see cpns , you know we 're in area we 're looking at band six or seven cpns . I think the same nationally uh . There are not many of them around they 're in short supply and many of the mental health services proper are crying out for them"
No," rest of the documents , and i know that you 've been having a a beginning to have a look and pick that apart this morning . Um is there anything that you 've learned that might be of benefit for the egp learners out there ? So so we 've got a couple of uh key"
No, two different domains compared to previous years . So previously this has looked at things like learning disabilities . It 'S looked at early cancer awareness and diagnosis this year is focusing on um prescribing in terms of drug dependency
No," involved in this okay , so we 're going to go through what that is and and stuff and but as andy 's got it under the under the thing and so and basically the first thing you have to do for The prescribing um drug dependency and we 'll read it out"
No," for you , so the contractor can demonstrate continuous quality improvement activity focused on prescription drug dependency as specified across guidance and we 'll talk about in a second and then that gives you 27 points , which is the majority of"
No, one and for the following elements in terms of gp access . Do you welcome the inclusion of this as a qr indicator ? What do you think about this one ? So we 're going to get into this ? I think the drug
No, when we talk about drug dependency - and it is quite broad be very clear on this point so um it talks about looking at particularly medications of um . I forgot the phrase it uses : um dependence forming medications dfms . So if you see that acronym that 's what it
No," then the z , drugs , so the sleeping drugs and stuff and they form in terms of the amount of prescription generated across in total they form . According to nhs england , a 16 19 21 of prescriptions issued across the"
No," pharmacists , largely um and uh . The helpful changes to the nice chronic pain guidelines that occurred last year um . I 'M i 'm quite pleased to see this as an area of focus actually um . You know for the government - and you know and for"
No, few particular chronic pain patients where we 've really focused on reducing um . You know that there 's a there 's no more for their oxycodone prescriptions and you know they seem to have a better time life . So i think this might be an area where we
No," interventions , improved patients , understanding the potential benefits of harm and stuff for the medications and noninitiation of other medication groups in particular identifies ketamine and um diapering because they are potentially sedating drugs that can have"
No," similar impacts in terms of the Opiates and stuff , so it 's looking at those potential outcomes and stuff in terms of achieving the cough ui itself um . There are definitely four three things yeah , so you need to"
No," all . It hopes that you 've already got those in existence or you 've got other things to support patients with yeah , okay yeah , i suppose there 's some . You know there is some funding associated with it , but i guess you get that on"
Environment," completion , not ahead of time um . I know we 've done some of these searches all already and um . I would say i think it 's been a useful exercise . Yeah um , before doing it , i thought gosh talking to you , know this . This group of patients that are on high amounts of opiates suffer"
No," with chronic pain . You know you uh . I thought it might be difficult to make an impact , but actually i mean some with some patients : it 's actually made a real impact for them for for the better um , so um , and i think it 's really important to"
No," underestimate the impact i can have . We know that particularly opiate use , you know , can have a huge issue in terms of bowel implications , because that 's a common side effect , but in terms of hyper allergies here , so they can have an increased pain response results of it ."
No," They can have impact in terms of dementia and cognitive function can decline as a result , so that can increase risk of falls . Obviously that can increase risk of fractures . You know there 's a huge implication in terms of the longterm use of opiates , and we know"
No," that multiple dependence forming medications as they now use the term in combination with things , increases that that 's the driving risk . You know reminding your patients if you 're taking some of these drugs , you may not be safe to drive , you know"
No," towards the chronic element of use and medications , and things so being aware that this does n't mean that you should n't use the drugs at all . It 'S just very much focusing on that . They have their appropriate use and you should use them in those situations , and"
No," , considerable variation in confidence , and it comes to alternative options in terms of prescribing for patients with chronic pain and parallel variation . That 'S the part i 'm struggling with . You know what are the alternative options that we have in"
No," , is , is really really helpful to get hand in hand with reducing their pain , medication . It 'S those sorts of psychological and activity interventions . Um , it 's difficult , i mean often you can use what 's already there in terms of um your"
No," We'Ll come to the timeline for that in a second and then the fourth one is looking at differences in drugs , so you could potentially pick patients who are taking benzodiazepines with opiates or zed drugs with benzodiazepines . Absolutely"
No," good length of time to do some of this stuff , particularly that 120 milligrams of morphine patient workload . That 'S not something that 's going to change overnight ! That is going to take several consultations to support these patients and also to look at the changes and"
No," , meeting probably end of the year , if not sooner potentially , but i think i suspect most people as usual will end up having in january february time um . But then that will give you the opportunity to fill in the rest of the the document , and so , if you scroll down to the bit"
Environment," and 365 that we all get access to uh some forms yeah via you know our nhs subscriptions and uh . It 'S come along a long way in the last few years . It 'S actually a really really helpful exercise , and maybe we could even do an episode uh about that . Just to spell it"
No," at how you can tackle the quaf qi elements for optimizing general practice access . So have a look at that document . If you want to watch the video that shows you , the document detail feel free to check it out on egp learning for yourself as well ."
No," picking a particular population . Your area that may have more challenges in terms of access would probably be a really sensible thing to go for some patients , potentially learning disabilities patients of nonenglish speaking backgrounds and that kind of"
Environment," stuff . How are you tackling those particular health inequalities , improve their access to care and things , and then education , education , education seems to come through in terms of this to then have an outcome in terms of the timeline"
No," lots to cover there um . We hope you found that really useful and effective we 've pretty much hit our time and apologies for the pause . We had in between and we 've had , i think , some extra comments and stuff um can we have the documents to links yet we will do we 'll"
No," to kinda spending the rest of my life, trying to figure out how to be a healthy, productive kick ass 90 year old. Aerobic base, anaerobic peak, stability, strength. How do those things matter when you're 90? And for me, that is the sort of defining principle of health span is sort of understanding cognitively,"
No," Peter is incredibly smart. He's truly innovative in his practice. He's a relentless self experimenter. And on top of all of this, he's also an accomplished endurance athlete. He's among the very few who have swam the Catalina channel in both directions"
Environment," the first in what I hope to be many, focuses on a few very specific topics, zone two training, the applied science of longevity, why we should all be training for what Peter calls, the Centenarian decathlon and metabolic health, all things metabolic health. Peter is a fascinating human."
No," And this episode is a highly educational treasure trove of practical actionable takeaways, certain to improve your current and future wellbeing. I hope you enjoy it. So without further ado, please hit that subscribe button and enjoy. What years were you at Stanford?"
Environment," It was an incredible unbeatable lineup. Yeah. And just to be training in like Pablo's lane, like chasing his feet was like, I can't even believe I'm here, but not the ideal regimen, for me to reach my potential, I think. And Skip is a complicated character."
No," So I've spoke about it at length on the show, yeah. My favorite coach is Jon Urbanchek from Michigan. I don't know if you've ever met him. I did, I got to, so Ed Moses was a friend of mine. I know Ed, I grew up, we were on the same club team in D.C."
No," Oh, no, way! Yeah, he's so much younger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in 2012, when ed was trying to come back to make the Olympic team, we'd become friends 'cause we met at Masters. Right."
No," And then the coach was like, dude do that again. And he was like, oh yeah, this is your stroke. This is what you should have been doing all along. It's just kind of, it's like, it's all about the length of your femur, the flexibility of your hips. Like it's just, it's a weird stroke."
Environment," Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the training. It's unbelievable how different the training is now compared to my era. I grew up in a period where it was just all about volume. Yep. Two hours in the morning, two hours at night."
Environment, The times are so much faster than anything I could have possibly even conceived of in that time. And my only sense of how that's possible is huge strides in training methodology. For sure. And I got a taste of that. I've dropped in from time to time at USC
Environment," And then, basically just the cross training I was doing on the bike got me a little more excited about being on the bike and also kind of, I think part of what was so fun about the Master's program is what a tight knit group we were and we loved competing. We went to every single meet"
Environment," and it was a bit of a hike for me. We moved further north in San Francisco. So I moved to a different Master's club and it was just not, like nobody wanted to go to meets. Right. People were there to exercise, which is fine,"
No," Yep. That they do in conjunction with the Waikiki open water swim. I'm constantly hearing, I have tons of friends who've done it. It's all fine, but like it's not without its shark problems."
No," Yeah, now there's more sharks in the Molokai Channel. So that channel is really sharky. And I've got a friend who's done that in both directions getting, Forrest Nelson. I mean, that's a tough channel. That's about 26 miles. And I mean, there's nothing between you and the ocean."
No," that have become kind of at the forefront of what you talk about and write about through my own experience of dealing with lower back pain. Suddenly, I'm in a position where I can't run without pain. And even if I'm on the bike for more than a couple hours, my back becomes intolerable. I've got an L4 that's kind of out of whack"
No," and sciatic pain. So I was like, alright, well, I'll swim, I'll get in the pool. This should be supportive. And I signed up for the Key West 20 kilometer swim, which was just this past weekend, with the intention of competing in that."
No, Yeah. I just couldn't do a flip turn anymore without pain. And so now I'm sidelined in a way that I haven't been in the history of my experiences of being an athlete and I'm now compelled out of pain to confront and deal with this
No," situation in a meaningful way. And it's been really humbling. And so as I think I messaged to you like the videos that you're putting up about mobility and like glued activation and all of these things, have been like the most important thing in my life as I slowly kind of acclimate to a new way"
No," of thinking about fitness through movements, etcetera. So I think it would be instructive to explain how this became of interest to you. And it's obviously, it's part and parcel with your interest in longevity, but maybe kind of walk us through that. I mean, there's a story that you probably know, but I think it might be helpful to just explain"
No," an unfortunate reality of our species, which is we tend to respond best to pain. A hundred percent. I mean, any change I've ever made is only because I've been forced to out of extreme pain. Yeah. So my first brush with that"
Environment," came in my last year of medical school. So it's June of 2000 at our Alma mater, right? So I'm just on my bike riding to the gym back when it was the Arriaga Center there, I get off my bike, getting ready to lock it up and I'm like, God, something does not feel right in my back,"
No," like a really weird pain. And so bad in fact that I decided, you know what? I'm gonna get back on my bike and ride back to wherever I live. I think I lived in Escondido Village or something. So I do that."
No," And I'm thinking, you know what, I'm gonna be fine. I just need to kind of rest today, which is very unusual for me. Like I'm not that guy who takes a day off. Well, the next day I can't actually get out of bed. So I actually call my roommate, two separate lines. I'm like, dude, you gotta get me up."
No," And to make a long story short, that transitioned into kind of two weeks of debilitating back pain that ultimately led to what I didn't realize at the time was a free fragment. So a fragment of my L5S1 disc broke off, was about four centimeters long and it just parked itself on my S1 nerve route."
No," And I was probably three months of only able to lay on a floor. Wow. Or bed, like those are my only two positions. Mom had to fly down to take care of me, to feed me, didn't lay down. Went from I'm not sure I'll be able to be a surgeon,"
No," I'm not sure I'll graduate on time, to I'm not sure I'll ever walk again. Wow. And then an amazing doctor there, actually a guy who I'd like to have on my podcast at some point, his name's Sean Mackey, he's a pain specialist."
No," He was kind of the guy that broke this cycle and began the treatments that were, that got me outta pain enough to then do the rehab. And amazingly within a year of that incident, I was at Hopkins standing on my feet, operating, as a surgical resident. But that was like kind of an aha moment."
No," I have a friend who works most, exclusively with kind of NFL guys and his take is from the day you sign your first contract after the NFL combine, after you've shown everybody how fast you can run a 40 and how much you can bench press and all that stuff. Like you stop caring about those metrics forever."
No," anaerobic peak, stability, strength and how do those things matter when you're 90 and what what's the standard we should hold ourselves to? What's a realistic aspiration for someone in their marginal decade,"
No," which is the way we talk about the last decade of your life. And the way that you kind of construct an architecture around how to think and approach this, is by working backwards. Yeah. From a perspective of what your values and your goals are"
No," If your vision of the last decade of your life is to be surrounded by family who love you and wanna be around you. But 40 years earlier, you have no relationships. Your kids hate you because you're a jerk and you're working all the time. There's a disconnect."
No," You have to be able, your muscles have to be able to consume this much oxygen per minute. If you actually tell me that you wanna be able to hike up that canyon in that many minutes, if you tell me that you wanna be able to stand up and do X, Y, and Z, it will require this much strength."
No," what are the things that somebody of my age or just kind of in the middle age sector of life, what should we be thinking about and what are some of the practices that we should be starting to adopt? I mean, we would start by being"
No," we ask our patients and this is absurdly specific stuff. And some of it is like things you wouldn't think about, like do you wanna be able to have sex, right? Because if the answer is yes, like there is a certain level of fitness, mobility and strength that's required to do that. Do you want to be able to walk up"
No, this many flights of stairs? Do you want to be able to carry this many pounds of groceries? Do you want to be able to place something of this weight above your head? Do you want to be able to pick up a child of this weight from the ground?
Environment, And we just sort of force people to go through that exercise and you check off the things that don't matter to you and check off the things that do. And what that does is it turns into basically a consolidated set of metrics for strength and fitness and other things that are a bit foreign to people like scapular control.
Environment," So I had incredible efficiency with certain muscle groups, but I wasn't doing any of the kind of gym work required to be balanced in that regard. And as a result, I have certain atrophies and I have like misalignment in my posture and all sorts of things that, now I'm realizing are super problematic,"
No," not the least of which is my balance is terrible. Like if I stand on one foot or I try to put my socks on things like that, like it's hard. And that was like a huge revelatory moment for me to realize there's something terribly awry here. And now I'm on a certain type of protocol. Like you tell somebody you have back pain,"
Environment," And you know, I've only been doing this for like a month, but initially, like I had zero glute. I couldn't even, my brain would signal to that muscle group and it wouldn't do anything. Like that's how bad that situation was. And now I can kind of do these little exercises"
No," I was a hundred percent all in on my Centenarian decathlon, not just sort of in name, but the sort of the ethos of this thing, which is I am no longer making any concessions, 'cause one of the dirty little secrets is, and I love a friend of mine, Kyler Brown, said this to me, he goes,"
No," more whole plants, more fruits, vegetables, seeds, beans, and legumes into their daily routine. Sadly however, without the kitchen tools and support, very few end up sticking with it. So because adopting a plantbased diet transformed my life so profoundly."
No," are the greatest source of joy in my life. My hope is that my kids have kids and that we're in proximity to them. And I just get to do the kind of stuff with them that I get to do with my kids right now. So again, it's silly, simple stuff, but again, I'm fortunate that,"
No," I still have two boys that are young five and eight. And so I realize to play with them is hard. Like they play on the floor. We're building Lego, we're building tracks, we're pushing trucks, we're doing that stuff. And when I look at, for example, my dad, who's 85,"
No, he can't engage with kids like that. And a big part of it is my dad's mentally as sharp as a tack. He can't get on the floor. So something as simple as can you get on the floor. Spend 30 minutes without your back breaking and get up. Now that takes a lot of intro abdominal stability.
No," And so for me, that's something that I would love to be able to continue to do. And that requires not just the strength and the coordination and the mental acuity to do it. You have to be able to tolerate insanely hot temperatures. It gets so hot inside of a race car"
No, is noticing how natural it is for your children to do all of these movements that then become so difficult for us as adults because we've unlearned them. And our sedentary lifestyles kind of detach us from our kind of natural blueprint and ability to do those things.
No," It just had this little nagging pain in my right SI joint. Certainly didn't ever raise to the level of lower back pain, no sciatica, nothing like that. But whenever I deadlifted really, really heavy, 50% of those days, I would be punished with some right SI joint pain. And again, these two things seemed"
No," So now we're just gonna basically reprogramming it. Right, so what is an example of a DNS movement. The first one and the core one. I'm trying to understand. Yeah, yeah, yeah, visualize it. The very first one is something called learning how to access intra abdominal pressure."
No," So I think most people who think about breathing, have a pretty good sense that you aren't just breathing into your thoracic cavity, right? A good breath has to have the diaphragm going down. You have to get into the abdomen. What DNS does is it really explains to you how a child is breathing, which is,"
No," if you imagine the waistband of your pants or your shorts, when a child is breathing, that thing is fully expanding. So they have purely concentric force in their abdomen with every breath. And again, if you look at a really good power lifter or something, you'll see the same thing."
No," I have a very congenitally narrow C spine. And if you look at an MRI of my neck, you wouldn't believe what a disaster it looks like, even though I've never really had an issue, but I'm being very preventative about it. And so one of the other things I'm working on is learning how to use the deep neck stabilizers."
No, So these are muscles that ride on the back. They're inside. You don't see them. So they're not these scaling muscles that are in front. They're the muscles that sit on the vertebral body sort of deep in my neck. And it's learning how to use those muscles
No," six month position where now a child is learning how to roll. Well, they roll in a very connected way. So when they're reaching for something with this arm, they're completely connected across their oblique sling, and they're gonna initiate that movement and down to their foot."
No," scapula's all over the place and all that sort of stuff. And here's the other thing, the best athletes in the world kind of naturally do this. That's another thing I've learned is that there are some really exceptional athletes out there who have never once spent a minute learning DNS."
No," how much further can I get in those things? And then it's part of what we call our dailies. So for our patients, we program things called dailies. Like this is gonna, whether today's a zone two day, a strength day a rest day, you still have your dailies. You got your 10 minutes of daily."
Environment," kind of movement activation type of exercises. I don't think there's anybody who's not gonna benefit from DNS, but I also acknowledge that I don't think it fixes every problem. So there's a whole other system called PRI, Postural Restoration Institute,"
No," So excess lordosis and learning how to relax my ribs has been insane. Yeah. The guy who does my tissue work, who's been working on me for, I don't know, probably 10 years, eight years, he's shown me pictures of what my lower back"
Environment," Yeah. It's so locked up back here. And when I lie flat and I try to do pelvic mobility exercises, it's so incredibly limited, like that pivot is just, I have no range whatsoever. I mean, you'll get it. Once you learn to use the hamstrings,"
Environment," once you learn how to activate those hamstrings and we started doing it single leg at a time. this is where Beth's real brilliance shines, is just being able to come up with these exercises. If you just put your foot on a one inch block and elevate the right foot more than the left and take turns with the activation,"
No," which is the stability component. And that's the foundation. Everything has to be built upon that. And then there are, I sort of think of like three pillars that stand on the foundation, strength and aerobic base, which is effectively a proxy for mitochondrial efficiency"
No," and exceptional fuel partitioning, and then a peak aerobic/anaerobic piece. So kind of think of your V02 Max, your zone two and your strength. And again, I think people have a sort of intuitive sense of what those look like, the devil is in the details and you know,"
Environment," for understandable reasons probably tell people that they don't need to do that much exercise, 'cause we're talking to the average person who's doing none. And it's true that if you're doing no exercise, just getting you to do three hours a week, has an unbelievable impact on your life. Probably more than anything else you could tell"
Environment," So maybe set that aside for now and we can kind of parse the fitness aspect of this, the exercise aspect of this, but when it comes to these other areas, the emotional area and the cognitive area, like how are you thinking about practices in that regard?"
No," And so we think of kind of these three areas of cognition, executive function, processing speed and memory, both short term and long term. Different forms of dementia will take on a different assault on each of those things. And that's become a very interesting study in the field of neurology."
No," there's a lot of different subtypes within there, but we also realize that there are some commonalities with respect to prevention and unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you think about it, prevention is kind of our best hope when it comes to that. This is even more so than cancer"
No," it has yielded effectively nothing. There are some treatments that can probably slow down progression, but the reality is you just wanna be in a position where you're addressing this even before we have what's called mild cognitive impairment. So what do we know about this?"
Environment," Well, I mean, what we know is exercise is the single biggest elixir for brain health. And it's amazing how, how much more powerful it appears to be than nutrition, even sleep and those things are very important, but exercise is in a league of its own."
Environment," could have had a bigger role, but as important as sleep, nutrition are, exercise kind of takes the cake. And I suspect it's because it impacts so many systems. Right. So exercise is going to impact glucose disposal, insulin sensitivity, inflammation."
Environment," It produces growth factors for neurons, BDNF. You tell a person that the most important thing they can do for their brain health is to exercise. That's where you get into the hey, if you could do three hours a week, that's great. If you can do seven hours a week, it's even better. Sleep does matter."
No," With sleep, I think we have, the problem of sort of one, do you have pathology? Yes or no, right? Do you have sleep apnea? I think there's a lot of undiagnosed sleep apnea out there. So we kind of have to make sure we're catching those patients 'cause they don't all look the same, right?"
No," The stereotype is somebody with sleep apnea is overweight and they're snoring all the time, but it turns out that there's a lot of sleep apnea that doesn't fit into that bucket. So we definitely wanna catch those people. And then you get into basically duration and quality. So are you sleeping long enough?"
No," these are diseases that are being built bit by bit for decades. That's right. So we can't start thinking about this soon enough, the earlier in our life that we're adopting the lifestyle measures required to sidestep these things. It cannot be overstated."
No," So in cardiovascular disease, we typically use the threshold of 5% at a 10 year forward looking window. So once your risk of heart attack, stroke or cardiac death reaches 5% for the next 10 years, you are a treatment priority. And I'll give you an example"
No," of why I think that makes no sense. So we know that smoking causes lung cancer. There's no ambiguity that there's a causal relationship between cigarettes and lung cancer. So imagine if we said to all smokers out there, the moment we believe your risk of lung cancer exceeds 5% over the next decade, we're gonna make you quit smoking."
No," Conversely, imagine you just said, the moment you pick up a cigarette, we're gonna tell you to quit smoking because smoking is causally related, totally different framework. And it's the latter framework that I think we have to be thinking about for cardiovascular disease"
No," That's very different from where your focus is. So how are you thinking about this in a way that perhaps matches or does not match what we're seeing from people like David Sinclair and his kind of opponent in that realm? Charles Brenner. Yeah, look, I mean,"
Environment," I think David and Charles basically go back and forth about two different molecules, right? NR and NMN as precursors for NAD. And again, I would say no disrespect to them, but that's like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic compared to exercise. So look, I would say that the data"
Environment," They're certainly not going to be on the order of what we see with exercise. I don't think people and I don't mean not to come back to exercise. I'm not talking about it 'cause it's like fun and it's 'cause it's easy, I'm talking about it 'cause the magnitude is insane."
No," and ultimately produced a drug that was a potent immunosuppressant. So it suppressed the proliferation of T cells. And in the late nineties was approved by the FDA for use in patients with organ transplants. But a decade later, another discovery was made, which was actually, if you dosed it a bit,"
No," a little differently, it was a very potent longevity agent. So potent in fact that it did something no drug or molecule had ever done before or has ever done since, which is it extends life in every organism across the entire spectrum of eukaryotic models. So yeast, worms, fruit flies, mice. We now see it in even other organisms."
No," that we've got funding for. I think we've got the funding to launch it. We're just kind of waiting for the backlog on some of the COVID related IRB stuff, with Iñigo San Millán is to do a study, looking at the use of Metformin in really metabolically healthy people."
Environment," of all of the epidemiologic data that looked really promising that Metformin is especially going to prevent cancer. But once I got really nerdy on my zone two training and was really tracking lactate levels and doing all sorts of stuff, I just couldn't help"
Environment," And frankly, even in patients who are metabolically unhealthy, but whom we're able to push down the exercise pathway. I've been on the let's not even bother with Metformin. But the reality of it is I want to know the answer to this question. And I want to know it very specifically in a subset"
No," is through fuel partitioning. So fuel partitioning is basically a fancy way of saying, how does your body know what to do with the energy you put in it? Where does it put it and how does it access it later? And someone like you, someone like me, like our bodies are pretty good at doing this."
Environment," We know when you eat glucose, fat, protein, this part we should use, this part we should store. And when we go to exercise, we know how to access the right one. So this is where kind of zone two comes back into it. Zone two is basically a test of your mitochondrial efficiency."
Environment," and just how malleable metabolic health is. Fortunately it is quite malleable and there are, different ways that we go about doing it depending on what we think are the contributing factors. So sleep, nutrition, exercise and pharmacology, would be the main contributing factors."
Environment," with the medicine, but you're not getting as much of a benefit as if you fix them sort of with food, sleep and exercise. So when we're trying to evaluate, so let's say, the hypothetical patient comes in and everything is wrong. So then the next question is why, what are the contributing factors?"
No," Sleep is the first thing we always wanna look at, 'cause it's the easiest one to assess pretty quickly. So again, to your point, most of our patients are wearing an Oura Ring. So that's provides some information. We use some sleep surveys that are pretty well vetted, so there's probably four or five of them."
No," And depending on what we see on the Oura data and what we see in the sleep surveys, we then might move to another test to look for, like an at home test that can give us a very quick view on apnea. And depending on what we see there, we might move to a more formal sleep study."
No," We go down with sleep that involves sleep hygiene, that involves supplements. And sometimes frankly includes medications. There's a prescription drug called Trazodone that really helps people who are dysregulated in their sleep because of rumination."
No," So it's a nonhabit forming amazing drug that more importantly, preserves sleep architecture. Most sleep drugs don't really preserve sleep architecture that well. Right. On the nutrition front,"
Environment," And then the next question is, are you over muscled? Pardon me under muscled or adequately muscled. And that plays a hugely important role for our protein strategy and our training strategy. And then once we sort of go through the well, presumably you're over nourished, let's say you're also under muscled."
Environment," Let's make it really hard, 'cause that's a really difficult reconciliation. If someone's over nourished and under muscled, they have to lose weight and gain muscle. So now you need a lot of protein and a lot of training. The question then becomes what is the strategy for intake reduction?"
Environment," You have three strategies, caloric restriction, dietary restriction, time restriction, and go into all the details of the pros and cons of each one. On the exercise front, it really depends on what they're doing to begin with. Each type of exercise has its benefit,"
Environment," but if you're talking about a person who's starting from zero, we're mostly working on movement, stability and zone two. I'm not gonna push them into VO2 Max, not gonna let them get hurt trying to do any significant strength training. It's how do we fix the chassis,"
Environment," who is fairly dysregulated into a zone of relative safety? Yeah, again, it's all comes down to adherence. I think back to a patient that joined our practice about a year ago, liver function tests, on arrival were, 3X, 4X, normal, demonstrating lots of fatty liver disease,"
No," I noticed that when I was experimenting with one meal a day, that was a disaster, especially when that one meal a day comes very late. Disregulates my sleep and the spikes were crazy and they don't come down quickly. And I was like, and I've been doing that for a while. And I was like, I have to stop doing this."
No," a danger with a lot of these trackable types of things, is it gives us all this data, but there's less focus on like what to do with the data and really to kind of figure out, what is meaningful in all of this. So what should I be thinking about and what are some of the common misconceptions"
Environment," People just do really, really well. Right, right, right. So this is very empirical and everyone will have a different carbohydrate tolerance, right? It's a function of your sleep, your stress, your metabolic health, your exercise."
No," It is interesting how much sleep comes into play. Like if I don't sleep well. Oh, your numbers are horrible. It's terrible. Yeah. All over the map. And I thought, well, is that because of the poor sleep or is the lack of stability contributing to the poor sleep?"
No," So you do this test on people and then they were sleep, it was a crossover group. So a control and then a crossover. And the intervention was, I wanna say two weeks of sleep deprivation to four hours a night, which by the way, like that was my residency for five years."
No," So that's not an unreasonable intervention. And then repeat the glycemic clamp and glucose disposal fell by 50%. Wow. So in two weeks of admittedly really bad sleep, you're taking somebody halfway to diabetes. So now imagine a person whose sleep"
No," is compromised for years. So that's why going back to what we said at the outset, if you're not looking at a person's sleep with real seriousness, before you try to address their metabolic health, you could be missing a wolf standing at your door. But the good news, of course,"
No," being this malleability piece that it can be corrected. And you know, in the context of a culture where it appears that by 2030, something like 50% of Americans are gonna be either prediabetic diabetic or diabetic, is this not the most important thing to be thinking about tracking and talking about?"
Environment," in the education space to help people like myself understand how to interpret the data. Yeah, and in that sense, I'm actually empathetic. And I understand why saying like let's slow down a little bit and let's make sure, 'cause again, I think our patients"
Environment," Okay, I won't eat that thing. And then it's become like, how flat can I make my curve? And like how, but there is an engagement there that I can't imagine is a negative thing. Like you are connected to what's happening in your body in real time and with the appropriate amount of education."
No," but I've certainly talked about it. If I said to you Rich, the only metric that matters in life is the number on the scale. And lower is better. If I program that into your mind, there's no reason you wouldn't take up smoking."
No," if I literally ate nothing but bacon every single day. Just nothing but fat, like you'll keep your. You'll keep your glucose low. I'm not convinced that that's an ideal diet Right, sure, sure. So that's why I think I would say this has to be viewed in the context of everything that you're doing."
Environment," And there has to be kind of a whole set of common sense principles that go into this along with just, this is the only number that matters. Right, got it. Let's segue into zone two. My favorite topic of all time. It's so hilarious that like zone two training"
Environment," is now like a thing that people love to talk about. Like I've been talking about this forever. Yeah, Philip Maffetone has been talking about it under different names. Yeah, so I caught on to the Maffetone method at the beginning of my ultra endurance training and I really credit adherence,"
Environment," At talking about this. Please allow me to indulge you in a conversation about zone two training. So I agree. I wish there was a better name for it because as you know, 'cause you've trained with a power meter on a bike. If you're a student of cycling power meters,"
Environment, we use seven zones when we're training and cycling. And so the first thing I say to anybody who's coming to this is please forget everything you know about your numbers and your zones. And this has nothing to do with FTP and the sort of Andrew Cogan sort of stuff. So it's just an energy system.
No," And the way Sam Milan describes it is really through five energy systems and zone two is the one that is basically defined as the maximal level of aerobic output, that you can generate while keeping lactate below two millimole. So you could argue that's an arbitrary definition,"
No," into this other energy source. Instead, you turn that glucose into pyruvate but now you turn the pyruvate into lactate and that does yield a little bit of ATP, literally about 1/16th the ATP you would've received, if you had run that glucose through the mitochondria. So that's a knock on it."
No," That's the trade off is you got a fraction of the energy, but the bigger trade off is that you're generating lactate, which now pairs with hydrogen and creates an acid, that acid effectively makes it very difficult for actin, myosin filaments to uncouple. And if that lactic acid level gets high enough, you start to really feel the inability,"
No," the burn in the muscle that creates the inability for you to continue effectively contracting your muscles. So anybody who's done an all out effort knows exactly what that feels like. Sure. The other variability being the exhaustibility of the energy source, right?"
Environment," You have like something like 45 minutes worth of glucose output at that higher zone training rate, whereas your fat stores are essentially inexhaustible. That's right. Right? So if you can develop a vast zone two capacity, which essentially means being able to be incredibly"
No," metabolically efficient at a certain activity, at a certain level of exertion, that in turn creates mitochondrial efficiency, mitochondrial density, and exten, basically an inexhaustible source of energy to propel you through an ultra endurance event or an endurance event."
No," Nausea is a given. Yeah, you're just puking your brains out. So anything you can do to minimize the requirement for having to feed the glucose engine, especially when you can't really take in a solution in excess of about 6% glucose, 60 grams per liter, you're very limited at how much glucose you can take in."
No," So, absolutely correct. Okay, so now the question becomes what separates men from the boys. Basically when you look at endurance sports, one of the most differentiating factors, is how high is a person's zone two threshold. Let's just use cycling as an example,"
Environment," protein synthesis and some amount of kind of strength that probably factors into it as well. Yeah. Like actual muscular strength. I remember when I was training for, for my first Ultraman. Prior to that, I'd messed around in"
No," I didn't know anything about it. And I was like, ah, I'll be good. Like I go in, that graph was like pathetic. I couldn't believe like how quickly I would go out of zone two. And then my whole program was built upon, this church of zone two where literally for the first year,"
Environment," and he owns all these world records at half marathon and marathon distance running, when he was like 90 and 91. It's amazing. Yeah. That he's able to do that. Talk a little bit about the importance of polarity training."
Environment, You talked about the different energy systems in the context of longevity. So this idea of Z2 and Z5 'cause what I see and I'm sure you see this all the time is people who spend the vast majority of their training time in that gray zone.
Environment," They're not going slow enough to develop their aerobic capacity, their mitochondrial efficiency and density, and they're not going hard enough to really reap the benefits of strength, power, etcetera. Yeah, the no man's land, the garbage training. It's an important zone, by the way, depending on your sport. Like when I was time trialing,"
No," And you know, I made a joke about this once I was like, it kind of occurred to me like how little anybody in the world cared. Like one day I was having dinner with my wife and I was like, do you know what my PR is for 20K? Just outta curiosity. Yeah."
Environment," I use on the bike, I use a WAHOO arm band and that's so that's what I use now. Right. So now I exercise with the WAHOO arm band and this watch. So I defaulted into what everybody told me from the beginning. Got it, alright."
Environment," Well we're starting to fray at the edges here, but let's kind of put a pin on the zone two, zone five thing in terms of what? Well, I didn't answer your question actually. Yeah, we're still in the. Yeah, so I would say if you're, if you're training for a specific sport,"
No," soapy rags there 'cause lactate doesn't wash off with alcohol. So you'll contaminate the whole thing if your hands aren't clean. Nobody's gonna do this. I know you do, but I mean hit the protocol that I've typically done in a lab and maybe it's different"
Environment," So just like when I go rucking, my heart rate is, sometimes I'll hit max heart rate if I'm on a steep enough hill. So I just consider that a separate form of exercise. Like a stationary bike? Yeah, as uninteresting as it is."
No," I know it's coming out in this fall and I don't know how much you can talk about it, but it looks absolutely epic. And like quite the adventure. It was a ton of fun. Darren is a really close friend and you know, Darren kind of pitched this idea to me probably in 2018. He was like, I've got this idea."
No," I'm gonna pitch it to Nat Geo at the time. Of course now it's Disney. And he said, what do you think? And I was like, I think it's a fantastic idea. And he said like, who do you think should be the lead actor? And we have a very close mutual friend in Hugh Jackman. And I was like, what do you think about Hugh?"
No," including ""Music Man,"" and things like that. Of course COVID messed everything up. Yeah. And then I don't know who suggested Chris, whether it was Darren or the networks, but then Chris became involved and that in some ways changed"
No," It was an amazing experience. It took probably twice as long as anyone expected because of COVID. We started filming, we did a, we did January and February a ton of work in 2020, just before COVID hit in Australia and in Norway and just by coincidence and by luck,"
No," was sharing some clips from. Where are you guys in Norway? Yeah. Yeah, and swimming in the freezing water and all of that. And Ross is like, I'm here with Darren and Chris and I'm messaging, I'm friends with Ross. And I was like, what are you guys doing?"
Environment," And I know that he worked really hard in helping to train Chris for Thor and got him in just insane shape. But I'm curious on your perspective on Ross and his kind of training protocol and philosophy, given that he's, attempting to do these ultramarathon swim adventures,"
No," I'm always like confused by his approach. I'm like, dude, you should lose like 40 pounds of muscle and trim down and you would have a better, you'll lose some power, but what you will gain in flexibility and efficiency will completely outweigh that."
Environment," as a kind of body buildingesque type specimen. And he has his whole philosophy around it, this mezzo phasing of the way that he trains. But primarily he's in the gym doing tons of strength training and the swimming doesn't come until much later. But I just know when I put on upper body bulk, I find it very difficult to swim"
Environment," any distances without a lot of lactate buildup. And when I was at my peak ultra conditioning where, when I was training for Ultraman, which is really a cycling race with a long run at the end of it, I made the choice to sacrifice. Ultra is 224 mile race? Yeah, it's a three day double Ironman."
No," this kind of swim he has an aspiration to do. I know about it. I don't think that he's announced it publicly. Yeah, so. What we talked about that interested him was the sleep cycling of it. So a friend of mine, a cyclist named Mike,"
No," well runner ultra runner, ultra cyclist named Mike Travino lives in San Diego. First year, he did RAM. He was second. He almost won RAM on his first attempt. He got really into sort of timing sleep. 'Cause obviously with RAM for people listening,"
No," a whole heck of a lot. And he was talking about how, they're now able to sort of try to wake people up at the right phase of sleep based on rapid eye movement. And so Ross was pretty interested in that, which was if he was about to embark"
No," on a really long swim, we're talking things that would take weeks and probably months, could he really optimize his sleep 'cause what he didn't wanna do is sort of sleep eight hours, swim, it's gotta be micros sleeps in there, which again, I can't speak to how healthy"
No," or unhealthy that is. It just doesn't strike me as a great, longevity play. But in the spirit of sort of pushing the extreme limits of what a human can do, that would be very interesting other than just sort of random, like when we used to do sleep sort of swim relays,"
No," which we did a lot of these. You'd sort of sleep three and a half hours between your legs. And it was just within three days, you're dead. Right. I feel like we're at the very beginning of understanding what's going on with that."
No," that type of pushing. You're done. Yeah, I'm done. And I don't. I'm really looking forward to kinda spending the rest of my life trying to figure out how to be a healthy, productive kick ass 90 year old."
No," Yeah, excellent. Well, I think that's a good place to end it for today. I could literally talk to you for six hours about a zillion different subjects. So I really appreciate you indulging me and I hope you'll come back and talk to me again. I really enjoyed it."
No," that you're giving and I commend you for it. And I just appreciate, your openness to look at conventional wisdom from a different point of view, but a very objective grounded science based perspective. And I've just gotten a lot of value out of what you're doing."
No," , that 's uncomfortable , awkward and difficult , but i 'm doing with my dear friend lewis howes who i admire . I learn so much from who we have these fascinating conversations with every month for hours and hours and hours , and we"
No," loud because it 's kind of scary , it 's scary . It 'S hard to talk about it 's controversial , especially if you 're in a relationship . Today 'S one is a scary one to ask , and these are two men in relationships i 've been married and with my wife for"
No," question we 're starting with and then we 'll kind of get lost in it is . Is it possible to be exclusive with and love one person for your entire life for the rest of your life ? Right , like that 's ? Oh , we put it"
No," talk yeah . We want to encourage you to share this with one person that you think would be interesting to have this conversation with . Maybe that is your partner , a friend or whatever ? Maybe your parents , maybe your parents and listen to this - share this conversation with one"
No," relationship . You have there 's all these shiny opportunities right or these different people that could bring you more joy or love than in the current relationship , and you and i both have friends that are in . Let 'S call it open"
No," early on right . You see something and you 're like i want that , but then there was never like a foundation of values . What you really want in your life together agreements ? You know this conscious conversation around being a couple . Yes , yes , and i would say"
No," i got a lot of joy out of wanting to see if i could get someone like that was the mindset yeah , because that was the mindset that i was brought up in now . Of course , when i look back at this , i do n't believe in that as a value , i do n't think"
No," something to be like . Oh this person 's into me or look what you know , which ultimately , is you trying to prove to yourself that you are worthy so that your friends respect you absolutely and so now you 're going out to obtain this thing . So how long were you doing that up"
No," drug is like there is someone out there that i 'm attracted to , or has something that i want , or i want to be in in contact with them , whether that 's a relationship or"
No," a hookup or whatever it might be right , and then the the Attempt to go after , i guess accomplishing this feat is like a drug . It is like this chemical drug that makes you kind of obsessive"
No," about it right until you get it and then , when you get it from a place that is unconscious , it never was fulfilling or rewarding for me right and it was creating a foundation from something that Wasn'T based on values , vision , lifestyle , things like that"
No," are my values : here 's my mission , i 'm on a mission to be impactful and serve humanity . This is the type of marriage i want to create . This is the type of life i want to have . This is the some of the stuff . I remember you telling me , i think , going into a relationship with"
No," conscious conversations is probably one of the only ways to set yourself up to win for a lifetime together , right yeah . If you want that , if you want to be a wife - and i know a lot of , i know a lot of people who say to me well , i enjoyed the chase in the pursuit like i did and you"
No," the chase again and the drug again , which is a great definition and you keep moving and moving and moving and then the individual has to decide . I think the choice is , do i want a longterm relationship or do i not , and there are gifts and pain points in"
No," conversation ? Because i do n't think that you have to love one person for the rest of your life , i do n't think someone should be forced to believe . That 'S the only way life works , especially because some people dedicate"
No," only one person and i think often the institutions of the world , marriage and religion , often kind of enforced people to believe that . Well , you got married at 21 . You'Ve got to be with this person for the rest of your life or you 're , a failure correct or you made"
No," them . So they try and try and try to make it work and maybe they could have made it work , but they just were n't in alignment or something but a lot of people i think , are in shame when they get a divorce or they 're in guilt or they 're . In sadness"
No," relationship is two individuals , independently living their lives and sharing their lives together . Like she 's gone for a couple weeks , working on a project in a movie right now and i 'm in los angeles doing my thing - i know with you and your wife - she"
No," might be gone or you might be traveling and sometimes you 're doing it together and sometimes depart And having the freedom and flexibility to be yourself and also be in the relationship , i think that 's for me . What is success at this season of my life yeah ? Maybe in 10 years"
No," really want ? What will support that vision , the highest level if you 're , a single guy and your vision is to you know , be really focused on your mission and your business and growth and your health , and , if you 're , spreading your energy"
No," around 10 different women you 're dating at once over A year or something or however many you want to date , there is a lot of excitement to that lifestyle , but then you have to unwind , and essentially you know , reject every person that you 're not going to be with"
No," yeah . So there 's like this unwinding , there 's this hurt phase it 's just phase where you 're you know , having challenging conversations and detaching from that intimacy of those connections and that 's a lot of energy ."
No," It 'S a lot of effort , that 's pulling you from your health or your other relationships or building something deeper and more meaningful when you have 10 service level relationships , as opposed to one deeper . I have different friends who have tried the whole"
No," with one person 's emotions . Yes than to deal with two - and this is what we do as humans - which i find really interesting - is that we make everything extreme so we 're so scared of codependency . So therefore , we go to polyamory yeah"
No," that the people i 've spoken to they 've said to me that they were scared of being codependent , so They believed , if they had more partners , then they would n't be codependent , yeah or they 'd get the excitement that they were missing in their relationship . They"
No," wanted the relationship that would give them support and peace and structure , but if they were missing , excitement . Okay , let me go find the excitement somewhere else yeah and for me that made a lot of sense in my 20s"
No," thinking that way , because i was just like . Oh , i do n't know if you could do this with one person for a long time . That was probably one of my biggest fears that i would be in love with someone or love someone consciously , but that"
No, yeah and that 's where i said like . I need to start therapy so that we have agreements . So i can feel peaceful to be myself . My full expression and dive into the relationship with curiosity and fun and excitement and desire in the relationship
No," Is that it 's it 's not that basically there 's no external shell ! That 'S going to solve your internal trauma and pain , so , whether you 're with one person or whether you 're , with three or two or four people . Neither of those are the cure , like you ca n't say , to"
No," someone like being with one person and being married to them , is the cure for your pain and trauma , or that if you have two people , then you wo n't be codependent like that , does n't solve it sure , and So you 've got to figure out . What is it again that i really want , and so for me"
No," someone knows they do n't want to have children , but they never talk about that with someone who they know wants to have children , because you 're scared of raising that that 's unhealthy , because that is going to come up one day Or if your desire long term is to live"
No," wife get together and say we want to do this for one more year : yeah yeah , and what worked this year ? What did n't work ? How can we make it better and do we want to do this ? For one more year , as opposed to for the rest of our lives , like thinking all the way 50 years away , yeah"
No," Is a recipe for failure ? What is it anything forget , loving another person ? What could you say that you 're going to do every day for the rest of your life ? Apart from shower and brush your teeth"
No," martha , and me early on , i was like here is my vision . Here are my values : here 's the lifestyle i want to have for at least the foreseeable next few years and yeah the next five to ten years . What i my intention is by coming from that space . I was completely clear"
No," happy , then we 're just not in alignment yeah . Thankfully she loved all the things about my values , vision and lifestyle moving forward . It 'S also kind of revealing all the things i 'm not proud of from the past . It 'S like , oh , this is how i was in this relationship and this"
No, society is that we believe that a long relationship is a successful one and really my definition of a relationship is . Are we growing together ? Are we thriving together and are we learning from each other ? Yes and if we say one more time are we are we growing
No," together ? Are we thriving together and are we learning from each other ? If i 'm not doing that with you anymore , then , if we 're not and then the question is , are you willing to change something in order to do that and if you 're not - and i think you have to be"
No," where there 's no more growth , no more learning and no more thriving , and that 's that low attachment . Yes , he 's recognizing that , just as in a business relationship , you would n't stay in business with someone if you were n't growing together , you were n't thriving together and you"
No," were n't learning together yeah and you want to keep your business open . If you were in the negative year after year . You were n't having fun , you did n't see , opportunities for growth . You were in an industry that was eliminating uh year after year , you 'd"
No," Can you be with one person for the rest of your life ? Can you love one person for the rest of your life and it 'd be a healthy overall , healthy , enriching relationship ? And again , i think about a successful relationship where"
No," they may not be part of your life story . They may not have your values , your vision , the lifestyle you want to have in your life . If a lot of those things do n't line up , then maybe you 're they 're , just a seasonal love story , not a longer season"
No," , life story , yeah , there 's , probably lesser people that could be a life story , yes yeah , and so i i do n't . I do n't think that there 's one person that you could be with for the rest of life , because you know again"
No," something could happen in a partnership where uh . If someone leaves this world , then you 're , just gon na say for the rest of my life , i 'm not gon na be in another relationship like there 's , there might be a situation"
No," in your life . Do you make a decision for the rest of your life for 50 ? 60 , 70 years , and so if you do want that with someone make sure that you are checking in regularly that you 're renewing that , like you 're reconnecting with each other regularly"
No," people back as well , and i know a lot of married people With kids , who are thriving , who are having fun every day or consistently , who are enjoying their lives ? Who live independently in the marriage as well and have their own time and flexibility"
No," this relationship for the rest of my life or whatever , but i 'm probably going to make mistakes , but i feel like i have a better awareness of self yeah at 25 . 27 . 30 . It 'S like that 's hard . I do n't know how you did it 10 years ago , yeah i mean nearly 10 years ."
Environment," It was yeah , it was next year would be ten years , but you had four years of month , training where you were just there 's . I mean there 's a bit of everything right like there 's the there was some maturity , but now , when i look back , i go i there was also parts of"
No, you just ca n't ever be scared to look in the mirror . You ca n't be scared to ask those questions . You ca n't ever stop doing that because that 's where it all goes wrong . I think that i have grown more significantly
No," , and that decision to remove that for the first . You know months of us kind of seeing each other and getting to know each other was so powerful for me because i was like do i want to be . I remember asking some friends in the past . I go if you"
No," guys did n't have sex . Would you still be together and a lot of them are like no okay , so remove sex from the relationship or move sexual chemistry from the relationship ? Would you want to spend quality time with this person consistently ? Are you adding value to"
No," their their life ? Are they adding value to your life ? Another person said you know : could you spend ten thousand meals with this person because that 's what it 's gon na be like if you 're getting married and you 're with them for a long time , ten thousand"
Environment," chemically , and you could feel that with people again and again and again and that 's why we get more attached to people that we have sex with in that way . And so for me , obviously through the monk training like that was a big part of it ."
Environment," I mean celibacy was a huge part of monk training and it was all for mental clarity , so you can make better decisions right . It 'S not about saying that you 're never having sex ! It 'S about the idea that can i make better decisions without being clouded from , without actually"
No," think everyone would agree that they 've been in a relationship and whenever there was an argument we leaned on sex and got back to like yeah to a foundation right , yeah , exactly and and they know that that was toxic and unhealthy because they dealt with pain ."
No," better decisions . Mental clarity , like you said , is this person 's behavior matching their words ? Do they have the same values that i have ? Are we in alignment on a lot of these things that we want , or do they do certain things that i 'll just never want"
No," that you both want to See if you can be in a great relationship to see if you can be in a thriving relationship , because human beings are just messed up , yeah yeah and if you 're trying to be like . Obviously , if you 're just someone who 's like i just wan na sleep"
No," was learning how to go . Take myself out on a date go to dinner , go to lunch , go to a movie alone and learn to enjoy my own company . It was so hard to do because i did n't enjoy my company for so long . I had too many negative conversations with myself and i"
No," That 'S when martha showed up . I was like you know , i 'm good , i 'm like so happy alone . I love my life . I'Ve got my business . I got my friends , i am good , that 's when she came in . I was like damn it . I do n't want to be around you right now , but it 's but i can do it because i"
No," together for 20 , 30 . 40 years . At least a lot of them , i feel like have that one day a week where they 're with their friends have that time where they go on a trip alone or with other other people in their life"
No," , they learn other activities . They go to workshops together , but also alone on things that they can add value to the relationship and to themselves feel independent , but also be committed yeah , and i think that is a huge thing to set yourself up to be a healthy"
No, whether it was a cooking class or whether it was pottery or whether it was trekking with gorillas that we just did right now or whether it was going on a hike together like it was doing something active Together and you know even in our relationship as as friends
No," like we were talking about this like when we said our values - fun , fitness and friendship , and we 've decided that we want to make sure that we are going out for dinner . But we also want to play some sports . We'Ve been playing pickleball together or our"
No," yeah . The goal of your relationship ca n't be . How do we stay together , like the goal of the relationship , is how do we serve together ? How do we give together ? How do we help our community together like couples who have that ability to expand their radius of care"
No," and compassion ? That 'S what ultimately goes to that stage , couples that stay together serve together . Yeah , i think that 's a great thing . You know , i think , in the fitness community they 're , like families that work out together stay together type of"
No," the the getting to know dating stage then you 're in the commitment stage , then you 're in marriage stage . And then it 's like what is the next stage , it 's being in service , it 's figuring out ways to serve your family , your friends , your community and the ways that make sense"
No, lots of people . I know a guy right now he 's single and he 's going on dates every week with different people taking people out to dinner and having interesting conversations and what matthew hussey says . Our friend is kind of like eliminating people that
No," i want to learn by meeting lots of people and learning in that way and dealing with what comes with that or do i want to learn in this way , and i think everything in life is simply a learning experience and at this season of my life , Yeah"
No," that one of the biggest values for me is peace , yeah , inner peace right and you kind of piece . If you and i for years , i would interview on camera and off camera older men who were successful in business or in their careers who had"
No," , and there was not one man who was like 50 60 70 years old , who was peaceful and fulfilled with multiple women at the same time or kind of trying to manage That you know that energy , the ones that had peace , which again is a"
No," value of mine , is having peace , because i feel like peace , helps us create mental clarity , which i think is important for you as well , which helps us have more energy towards our mission . Yeah and uh i have n't met one 67 year old man"
No," who was like . I had five girlfriends the whole time and i was peaceful , and so i just thinking what 's your value , what do you want if you want adventure and fun , and you ca n't have all that and peace there 's going to be some letting go ? So i"
No," really like - and this has been my biggest takeaway from today - is that you brought it back to values . If your value is experimentation and freedom , freedom , freedom from commitment"
No," , then that 's a beautiful life and i 'm not and again , i 'm not saying you should do either or i do you know it 's . It 'S all based on your values . Absolutely , and you just said your value is peace . My value is purpose . I want to be committed to my purpose"
No," and i had a really open and honest conversation with a friend recently . He asked me a question . He said jay , like you know , how do you deal with uh temptation and desire ? You know everything else and we had a really honest , vulnerable"
No," conversation mantoman , and i said to him that for me , one of my biggest values in life is history and loyalty . I like longterm friendships , because then you can look back and look at how far you 've come . That 'S cool and you"
No," ca n't do that from shortterm desire . Yeah i like loyalty . I love the idea of , like you 've , been loyal to a friend a person , a partner , and you can look back at how what you 've been through it 's cool . And so , when i look at my life , i love that me and you"
No," have memories from being in new york , together being in la together , doing a project together and in my romantic relationship . It 'S the same thing . It 'S like i 've , been with this"
No," woman when i had nothing when i was broke , pretty cool when i was at the like and i 'm here , and i value that right and someone might say jay , that 's still soft , like i do n't value that at all and that 's cool , Like i respect that , you may say you do n't value history , you"
No," value a onenight stand and that 's great , like there 's nothing wrong with that , but i think you 've got to know what you value and i love that you value peace , and i love that you equate a Committed relationship"
No," to peace and that 's beautiful and some people might say well , every relationship i 've been in is stressful , so i 'm going to value being single yeah and having surface conversations or surface interactions of intimacy that are n't scary to go deeper right where there"
No," could be heartbreak Or pain or frustration or whatever it is , and that 's your season , you know that 's what you value , but i i do . I definitely value intimacy connection , there 's nothing worse than accomplishing like your greatest goals"
No," and uh , something i value with . You know martha being inspired by what she 's , creating and she 's inspired what i 'm creating the mutual respect and inspiration , and i know you and radio the same way so conversation part two"
No, someone to have the same conversation with ask them this question : can you be with one person for the rest of your life ? Send them this audio or this video and have them watch or listen to this and then have the discussion with them shortly after and let us know your
No," thoughts , we 'd love to hear your thoughts on this . Thank you so much for watching everyone uh . I want to make sure that you think about what is your value right now in relationships like think about it , whether you 're"
No," single , whether you 're in a relationship whether you 've been married , whether you 're just broken up ? What is the current value in your life that you 're looking for , and what does that require ? Does that require you to be single ? Does that require you to be"
No," in relationship and what type of relationship uh leave your value in the comments below ? Let us know what your values are . Let us know topics that you want us to dive into deeper . Maybe there was something that we did n't quite get into and you 're like . Please , please talk"
No," in concert with your physician, who you should absolutely talk to before adding or changing anything to your diet or supplementation regime, can help you arrive at a salt intake that's going to optimize your mental, physical health, and performance,"
No," and actionable items. I'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting two live events this May. The first live event will take place in Seattle, Washington on May 17th. The second live event will take place in Portland, Oregon on May 18th."
No," Presale tickets for these two events are now available at hubermanlab.com/tour. I should mention that while I do hope to visit other cities in the near future to do more live events, right now, these are the only two live events I have scheduled,"
No," at least for the six months, so once again, if you go to hubermanlab.com/tour, you can access the presale tickets. I hope to see you at these live events, and as always, thank you for your interest in science. Before we dive into the topic of today's episode, I want to highlight a really exciting new study."
No," they taste sort of not right to them. They don't like the taste, but over time, they actually start to crave that taste. I've experienced this. I used to drink a lot of diet sodas when I was in graduate school, so this would be aspartame,"
No," of any fear of artificial sweeteners, I found that I didn't like the taste. Nowadays, I only occasionally drink a diet soda. I usually do that if I'm on a plane and there's nothing else available to me, so I don't demonize them. I might drink one every once in a while."
No," I like to think that the listeners of this podcast are looking for answers where we have answers, but are also, I would hope, excited about some of the new and emerging themes in what we call nutritional neurobiology, and indeed, the Bohorquez Lab really stands as one of the premier laboratories out there"
No," aka sodium intake, okay? So this is important. I think, right off the bat, a lot of people get themselves into a place of confusion and potentially even to a place of trouble by thinking that table salt in grams always equates to sodium in grams,"
Environment," where neurons are responsible for detecting odorants in the environment, for smell, that is, and in a little subregion of the hippocampus, a memory area, there's probably some neurogenesis, but the bulk of really good data out there point to the fact that in humans"
No," The ovaries and testes have a barrier for, we assume, the reason that they contain the genetic material by which we can pass on our genes to our offspring, progeny, meaning make children, and those children will have our genes, or at least half of them, the other half from the partner, of course."
No," and it turns out that the areas of the brain that monitor salt balance and other features of what's happening in the body at the level of what we call osmolarity, at the concentration of salt, reside in these little sets of neurons that sit just on the other side of these weak fences,"
No," that make you either want to drink more fluid or to stop drinking fluid. There are two main kinds of thirst. The first one is called osmotic thirst, and the second is called hypovolemic thirst. Osmotic thirst has to do with the concentration of salt in your bloodstream,"
No," meaning the salt concentration of the blood, is high, it activates these specific neurons in the OVLT, and by activates, I mean it causes them to send electrical potentials, literally, send electrical signals to other brain areas, and those other brain areas inspire a number of different downstream events,"
No," to increase the amount of urine that we secrete, so there's a complicated set of cascades that's evoked by having high salt concentration in the blood. There's also a complicated set of cascades that are evoked by having low concentrations of sodium in the blood, but the pathway is nonetheless the same. It's OVLT is detecting those osmolarity changes,"
No," If you're bleeding quite a lot, or in some cases, if you vomit quite a lot, or if you have extensive diarrhea or any combination of those, and there are other things that can reduce blood volume, and we will talk about some of those later, but in the classic case of hypovolemic thirst,"
No," will sense the increase in osmolarity, right? The concentration of salt is going to be increased relative to the fluid volume that's circulating. This, of course, assumes that you haven't excreted a lot of sodium for one reason or another, but that increase in osmolarity is detected by the OVLT."
No," well, then, the osmolarity, the salt concentration in your blood, is going to be lower. Your OVLT will detect that because of these osmosensing neurons in your OVLT. Your OVLT will fail to signal to the supraoptic nucleus,"
No," Very simple examples, but hopefully, it illustrates how events within the blood, meaning the concentration of salt relative to the amount of fluid, right? That's what osmolarity is, is detected by the OVLT. The brain then communicates to the pituitary. The pituitary sends a hormone out into the blood,"
No," That would be very uncomfortable. That's not the way it works. It actually causes the tubes headed towards the bladder from the kidney to become permeable, meaning to allow fluid to go back into the bloodstream, into the rest of the body,"
Environment," maybe normal tension, hormone levels, exercise, et cetera, et cetera. A pretty good example of how complicated this can all be is one that some of you may be familiar with. It's pretty well known that during certain phases of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone"
No," that have prehypertension or hypertension. You need to know if you have prehypertension or hypertension. You need to know if you have normal tension, meaning normal blood pressure. Everyone should know their blood pressure. It's a absolutely crucial measurement"
Environment, that has a lot of impact on your immediate and longterm health outcomes. It informs a lot about what you should do. Should you be doing more cardiovascular exercise? Should you be ingesting more or less salt? Should you be adjusting any number of different lifestyle factors?
No," in terms of salt and indeed fluid intake. There is a school of thought that everybody is consuming too much salt, and I do want to highlight the fact that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of quality papers that point to the fact that a, quoteunquote, high salt diet can be bad for various organs and tissues in the body,"
No," including the brain. It just so happens that because fluid balance, both inside and outside of cells, is crucial, not just for your heart and for your lungs and for your liver and for all the organs of your body, but also for your brain, that if the salt concentration"
No," point to the fact that a highsalt diet is detrimental to brain health and function. Most of the studies have focused on that aspect of salt balance and its consequences on brain function. One critical issue with many of those studies, however, is that the highsalt diet is often coupled to other elements of diet"
No," that are also unhealthy, things like excessively high levels of carbohydrates or fats or combinations of carbohydrates and fats, and so while I know there are many burning questions out there about how much salt one needs if they are on a lowcarbohydrate diet"
No," or if they are fasting or if they are on a vegan diet, there have simply not been many studies that have explored the low, moderate, and highsalt conditions on a backdrop of very controlled nutrition, and that's probably reflective of the fact that there are not a lot"
No," that indicate that the amount of salt intake can indeed predict health outcomes or what we call hazardous events, things like cardiovascular events and stroke and so forth, and what's interesting is that indeed a lower, I'm not saying low, right? Because I don't believe that you want your diet"
No," to be truly low in anything except, perhaps, poison, but a lowersalt diet can reduce the number of these socalled hazardous events, but it's a somewhat of a shallow Ushaped function such that, yes indeed, a high salt intake can be very detrimental for your health, both in terms of cardiovascular events, stroke,"
No," Well, because of the osmolarity of blood that we talked about before, where if you have a certain concentration of sodium, meaning sufficient sodium in your bloodstream, that will tend to draw water into the bloodstream, and essentially, the pipes that are your capillaries, arteries, and veins"
No," and other symptoms of things like orthostatic disorders, but, of course, to do that in a safe context and to never play games with your blood sugar or your blood osmolarity that could set your system down a cascade of negative events. Let's look at what the current recommendations are"
No," for people that suffer from orthostatic disorders like orthostatic hypo, meaning too low, tension, orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome, sometimes referred to as POTS, POTS, or idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and syncope. These have the incredibly elaborate names. Those groups are often told to increase their salt intake"
Environment," I simply can't tell you what to eat and what not to eat because I acknowledge the fact that some people are vegans because of ethical reasons related to animals, or some people are vegans because of reasons related to the climate and the environment. Other people do it for specific health reasons. Likewise, I know plenty of people"
Environment," but with respect to salt intake and the fact that salt intake is homeostatically regulated, it is the case that if you're craving salt, you probably need it, so for those of you that are sweating excessively, or even if you're in a very hot environment, and you're not exercising, and you're just losing,"
Environment," you're losing water and salt from your system, remember, also, that you can be in a very cold environment, very cold, dry environments often go together, and you can be losing a lot of fluids from your body, and you will crave fluids and salt even though it's cold and you're not actually noticeably perspiring, so if you're exercising a lot,"
Environment," if you're in a particular cold, dry environment or a particular hot environment, you ought to be ingesting sufficient amounts of salt and fluid. A rule of thumb for exercisebased replenishment of fluid comes from what I, some episodes back, referred to as the Galpin equation."
Environment," The Galpin equation, I named it after Andy Galpin, and I think that is the appropriate attribution there. Andy Galpin is an exercise physiologist at Cal State, Fullerton, I believe, and he's going to be a podcast guest here on the Huberman Lab Podcast. He's an exceptional muscle physiologist."
Environment," He also lives in the practical realm where he gives recommendations about exercise to expert athletes as well as the everyday person, so the Galpin equation is based on the fact that we lose about one to five pounds of water per hour, which can definitely impact our mental capacity and our physical performance,"
Environment," so the Galpin equation suggests that we start exercise hydrated with electrolytes, not just with water, so that means water that has some sodium, potassium, and magnesium. There are simple, lowcost ways to do that we'll talk about, and the formula for hydration, the socalled Galpin equation,"
Environment," is mainly designed for exercise, but I think is actually a very good rule of thumb for any time that you need to engage mental capacity, not just physical performance. Your body weight in pounds divided by 30 equals the ounces of fluid you should drink every 15 minutes"
Environment," and why it might be helpful to follow some of these formulas like the Galpin equation, especially if you're engaging in exercise where you're going to be perspiring, of course, is that your body will tend to adapt to a certain amount of salt intake over time, and then, your appetite for salt"
Environment," is dependent, is not as dependent on external water as once believed, right? What this system probably evolved to do was to adjust to different levels of sodium availability in the environment, and that raises a really key element of salt and its importance in human history"
No," so much so that there are actually written reports of people being paid for labor in the form of salt, and salt, when it's scarce, has been quite expensive in certain regions of the world, especially regions located further away from the sea, and a friend of mine who has deep roots within the culinary community"
No," You certainly don't want to drink seawater. Under conditions where the adrenals are missing, animals and humans will tend to prefer a higher sodium concentration fluid, and they will be willing to tolerate ingesting very high concentrations of sodium. Now, that's a very crude experiment,"
No," that it can cause stress and anxiety. There's some really nice data that point to the fact that low dietary sodium can actually exacerbate anxiety in animal models, and to some extent, there's evidence for this in humans as well, and that should not come as a surprise."
No," but it does point to the fact that if you're feeling anxious, perhaps from low blood pressure, which can also give symptoms of anxiety, as we talked about before, but even if it's independent of low blood pressure, that slightly increasing sodium intake,"
No," but I think that there's some, for most people, especially people who are not hypertensive, prehypertensive, there's some wiggle room to explore whether more intake of sodium could actually be beneficial for suppressing some of the anxiety responses that they might feel under conditions of stress."
No," that we've discussed on the podcast before in different contexts. I want to emphasize that many people are probably getting enough magnesium in their diet that they don't need to supplement magnesium. Some people, however, opt to supplement magnesium in ways that can support them,"
Environment," and there are many different forms of magnesium, and just in very brief passing, I'll just say that there is some evidence that you can reduce muscle soreness from exercise by ingestion of magnesium malate, MALATE. I've talked before about magnesium threonate, THRENOATE, magnesium threonate,"
No," for sake of promoting the transition into sleep and for depth of sleep and perhaps, again, highlighted perhaps, 'cause right now it's mainly animal studies and ongoing human studies, but the data aren't all in. Perhaps magnesium threonate can be used"
No," as a way to support cognitive function and longevity. That was discussed in the episode with Dr. Jack Feldman from UCLA. Typically, magnesium threonate is taken 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime in order to encourage sleep. You can go to our neural network newsletter and look for the one on sleep,"
No," not known to have cognitive enhancing effects, but seems, at least on par with magnesium threonate in terms of promoting transition into and depth of sleep and so on. There are other forms of magnesium, magnesium citrate, which has other functions. Actually, magnesium citrate"
No," is a fairly effective laxative, not known to promote sleep and things of that sort, so a lot of different forms of magnesium, and there's still other forms out there. Many people are not getting enough magnesium. Many people are. Okay, that's magnesium."
No," and, of course, many people opt to make their own hydration electrolyte formulas. They'll put sea salt into some water, maybe even ingest a potassium tablet. It all depends on the context, and an important contextual element is your diet, so, for instance, carbohydrates hold water in the body,"
No," so regardless of how much salt and how much fluid you're ingesting, if you're ingesting carbohydrate and you drink fluids, water, some of that fluid is going to be retained in the body. Now, for people that are following lowcarbohydrate diets, one of the most immediate effects of a lowcarbohydrate diet"
No," is that you're going to excrete more water, and so, under those conditions, you're also going to lose not just water, but you'll probably also lose sodium and potassium, and so some people, many people, in fact, find that when they are on a lower or lowcarbohydrate diet, then they need to make sure"
No," some people who are on lowcarbohydrate diets do ingest vegetables or other forms of food that carry along with them potassium, so it's quite variable from person to person. I mean, you can imagine if carbohydrate holds water, water and salt balance and potassium go hand in hand, and hand,"
No," that if you're on a lowcarbohydrate diet, that you might need to adjust your salt intake and potassium, and conversely, that if you're on a carbohydraterich diet or a moderate carbohydrate diet, then you may need to ingest less sodium and less potassium, and, in fact, a certain amount of water"
No," or at least timerestricted feeding, so they're eating between particular feeding windows, and then, in the certain parts of the 24hour cycle, not just sleep, but during certain parts of their waking cycle, they're also actively avoiding food, banking on, I think, either the possible,"
Environment," and so you're going to have to find ways to bring water, salt, and potassium back in. Again, this has to be evaluated for each of your own individual situations. If you're exercising fasted, and you're doing that after drinking caffeine, then before, during, and certainly after exercise,"
Environment," and so let's talk about what those ranges are, and I'm going to point you to a resource that explores what those ranges are in these various contexts of nutrition, exercise, and so on. The resource is a book that was authored by Dr. James DiNicolantonio. He's not a medical doctor."
No," for instance, for reducing anxiety a bit or for increasing blood pressure to offset some of these postural syndromes where you get dizzy, et cetera, for improving sports performance or cognitive performance, I can only recommend that you do this in a fairly clean context"
No," meaning enough little packets of neurotransmitter have been vomited onto its surface at sufficient concentration, what happens is little pores, little spaces, little gaps open up in the membrane of that cell that separates the inside from the outside, and because it's positive,"
No," and that's one of the primary reasons why dehydration leads to confusion and dizziness and lack of coordination, and I've talked about this a bit in the episode on endurance, but there are instances in which competitive athletes have come into the stadium to finish a final lap of a long endurance race"
Environment," and are completely disoriented and actually can't find their way to the finish line. It might sound like kind of a silly, crazy example, but there are examples of people having severe mental issues and physical issues postexercise when that exercise involved a ton of sweating"
Environment," or hot environments or insufficient ingestion of fluids and electrolytes because included in the electrolyte formula, of course, is sodium, and as you just learned, sodium is absolutely crucial for neurons to function, so to briefly recap some of what I've talked about today,"
No," might be optimal, depending on the context in which that range is being consumed, meaning depending on whether or not you're hypertensive, prehypertensive, or normal tension. We talked about fluid intake and electrolyte intake, so sodium, potassium, and magnesium"
No," in the context of athletic or sports performance, but also, in terms of maintaining cognitive function. Talked about the Galpin equation, which you could easily adapt to your body weight and to your circumstances. Of course, adjusting the amount of fluid and electrolyte intake upwards"
Environment," if you're exercising or working in very hot environments, downwards, maybe, if you're in less hot environments where you're sweating less and so on. We also talked about the relationship between the stress system and the salt craving system and why those two systems interact and why, for some people who may suffer a bit"
No," from anxiety or under conditions of stress, increasing salt intake, provided it's done through healthy means, might actually be beneficial. We also talked about conditions in which increasing salt intake might be beneficial for offsetting low blood pressure,"
No," and, of course, we talked about salt and its critical role in the action potential, the fundamental way in which the nervous system functions at all, so my hope for you, in listening to this episode, is that you consider a question, and that question is"
No," what salt intake is best for you? And that you place that question in the context of your fluid intake, you place that in the context of the diet you're following, the amount of caffeine you might be ingesting, and the diuretic effects of caffeine, and crucially, that you place that in the context"
Environment," of the electrolytes, more generally, meaning sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Someday, there will be an online program or an app, I imagine, where one could put a bunch of different parameters in about their particular health status, their particular diet, their particular exercise, et cetera."
No," It's an incredible substance. Our physiology is dependent on it. Our cognition is dependent on it. Indeed, our mental and physical health and our performance in essentially all aspects of life is dependent on it, and I hope I've been able to illuminate"
Environment, that allows them to detect the levels of salt in our body and to drive the intake of more or less salt and more or less fluid and other electrolytes really just points to the beauty of the system that we've all evolved that allows us to interact with our environment and make adjustments

No," many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like enhancing sleep and focus and so on. One issue with supplements, however, is that the quality of supplements varies tremendously from one brand to the next. For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, THORNE, because Thorne supplements"
No," I 'M going to discuss the mush screening tool in relation to the mental health of ski , which is now being included as a skill , so this is a way of determining if a patient is at risk of or is currently suffering from malnutrition ."
No," We do know that many many hospital admissions um have many patients already suffering from malnutrition and how it impacts on their health , their general overall physical health and their mental health as well . The"
Environment," weight has been lost in the last three to six months now that might not be unusual for somebody who 's on a diet or somebody who 's um , taking a lot of exercise or maybe he 's had some kind of uh episode of being unwell . Um would would account for this , so i i 'm actually"
Environment, going to check with the patient . If she can tell me if there 's been any problems with her diet or any changes to her exercise regime so a bath . Could i just ask you about your weight loss um ? It 'S been noted from your
No," uh current weight uh that you 've actually lost in the last few months . You'Ve lost four kilograms . Would this be due to have you been on a diet , or do you think you 've been restricting what you 've been eating"
Environment," or have you partook in something more physical than usual ? Oh , no ! I 'M eating the same food , i 'm doing the same things . I do n't go anywhere much and i do n't do much exercise . Okay , so uh , you would say , there 's been no changes at all"
No," normally , you would expect somebody with acute disease effects score to um , have some sort of medical problem um or some sort of mental health problem where they are or they 're doing it for some of the religious reason or whatever reason , withholding food"
No," nutritional support or implement local policy , so it says : set goals , improve and increase . Overall , nutritional intake monitoring review care plan in the hospital weekly , the care home monthly and it says in community monthly . So"
No," and it does mention obesity um . Just as an aside and just to say , you know that to record the impressions of obesity for those with underlying conditions , these are generally controlled before the treatment of obesity , but our patient is n't obese , she 's actually underweight ."
No," cheese into your diet and do you like cream or could you add that some of your diets yeah i like cream - i do like cream a lot . I could eat more of it as well . Okay , so try that and also snacking as well um in between meals will help so"
No," anything that does improve your weight but be careful with highly salted foods , because we , you do n't want to have too much salt in your diet , like crisps or some peanuts , salted or Nuts , but just yeah just to"
No," improvement , but um , we 'll just hope for an improvement . Is that ? Okay ? Yes , thank you , okay , so here 's the buzzer and i will leave the patient area i 'll , draw my hands and tidy up the area and"
No," disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorders, and depression among others. He is best known for understanding the relationship between how metabolism and these various disorders of the mind interact. And indeed, today, he describes not only his own fascinating journey into the field of psychiatry"
No, but also his clinical and research experience using diet that is different forms of nutrition in order to treat various psychiatric disorders. He describes some remarkable case studies of individuals and groups of people who have achieved tremendous relief from the types of psychiatric disorders that I just
No," During today's episode, he shares with us his overriding hypotheses about the critical roles that mitochondrial function and dysfunction play in mental health and mental illness, and how various particular types of diets ranging from the ketogenic diet to modified ketogenic diet and even just slight"
No," adjustments in carbohydrate intake can be used in order to change mitochondrial function and bring relief for various psychiatric illnesses. He also highlights the essential and important theme that various diet interventions, including the ketogenic diet, were not first developed for sake of weight loss but rather were developed as treatments"
No," the science and his clinical expertise, but also points to various actionable measures that people can take in order to improve their mental health. I'd like to mention that Dr. Palmer is also the author of a terrific new book. The title is Brain Energy: A Revolutionary Breakthrough in Understanding Mental Health and Improving"
No," Treatment for Anxiety, Depression, OCD, PTSD and More. I've read the book, and it is a terrific read. I came away from this book with a much evolved understanding of how the various psychiatric disorders that I just described, as well as ADHD, emerge in people. And it has completely revised my understanding about the possible origins of various psychiatric disorders"
No," Our first sponsor is Thesis. Thesis makes custom nootropics. And as I've said many times before on this podcast, I am not a fan of the word ""nootropics"" because it means smart drugs.

No," I've talked many times on this podcast about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature. That is, in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night, our body temperature needs to drop by about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely, when we wake up in the morning,"
Environment," that is, in large part, because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now, people have different core body temperatures. And they tend to run colder or hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you to adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment so that you have the optimal temperature that gets you the best night's"
No," sleep. I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago, and it has completely transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper. I wake up far less during the middle of the night, if at all. And I wake up feeling far better than I ever have even"
No," after the same amount of sleep. If you want to try Eight Sleeping, you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman to save up to $400 off their sleep fit holiday bundle, which includes their new Pod 3 cover. Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, select countries in the EU,"
No," with a bad experience, we feel less good in the short term. But I believe that very few people understand or are familiar with the fact that nutrition and our mental health interact in this very intimate, maybe even causal, way and that is something that occurs over long periods of time. Meaning, what I ate yesterday or the day before, maybe"
No," even 10 years ago, could be impacting the way that my brain and body are making me feel now. So if you would, I'd love for you to just tell us about a little bit of the history, in particular, your history with exploring the relationship between nutrition and mental health. And then we can dive into some of the more particulars"
No," of ketogenic diets versus other diets, and some of the truly miraculous findings that you and others are coming up with based on real patients and real experiences of people who suffer and then find relief by altering their nutrition. CHRIS PALMER: Sure. This story really starts with my own personal story."
No," And I don't need to go into great detail. But to set the stage, when I was a kid, I definitely had mental illness, started with OCD. A series of events happened in my family. My mother had a horrible kind of psychotic break, and all sorts of adverse childhood events for me. She and I were actually homeless together for a while."
No," I went on to have subsequent depression, suicidality, all sorts of things. But somehow or another, I pulled myself together and got through medical school actually did quite well in medical school, got an award for being one of the top students, and then was doing my internship and residency at Harvard."
No," And at that point in time, I was diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. So I had high blood pressure, horrible lipids, and prediabetes. And I was doing everything right supposedly. I was on a lowfat diet, and I was exercising regularly. And year after year, my doctor kept"
Environment," telling me diet and exercise. I kept asking him, what diet? What exercise? I was doing everything he kept telling me to do. Everything was getting worse. My blood pressure kept going higher. And at some point, he kind of said,"
No, that the Atkins diet could somehow help people improve their cholesterol in prediabetes. I actually didn't really believe it. I was highly skeptical. And I believed everything I was taught in medical school. Why would my professors lie to me? They knew what they were talking about.
No," Lowfat diet was the thing to do. And the Atkins diet was clearly dangerous and reckless. But I had been trying the medical dogma for years, and it wasn't working for me. And so for whatever reason, I decided this is going to be my last attempt at something different. And then I'll just bite the bullet and go on meds."
No," So I tried the Atkins diet. I did my own special version of it. I still avoided red meat because I was terrified of red meat. I tried to do a healthy version, which it's probably more like the South Beach diet. This was before the South Beach Diet was invented. But within three months, my metabolic syndrome"
No," you switched to this new diet, how was your mental health, if you don't mind me asking? Because it sound like you're very clear that there was metabolic syndrome or you were headed towards more severe metabolic syndrome. You mentioned OCD. I actually am familiar with this."
No," I was still struggling with low grade depression and OCD. Again, it wasn't necessarily interfering with my ability to function because I was functioning at a high level. Anybody looking from the outside, you're a top student. You just got into one of the most competitive actually, at that point, it was the most competitive residency"
No," And I found that those medications, they actually came with more side effects for me than benefits. I was on Prozac for a long time. It totally messed up my sleep. And then the psychiatrist was like, you need pills to help you sleep now."
No," And I'm I just I'm like, that doesn't that's not really resonating very well with me. And I'm now a psychiatrist. I'm in my psychiatry residency. And I'm thinking, you know what? That's just not sitting well with me"
No," that you're going to prescribe more and more meds for all the side effects that you're causing. And yet at the same time, I wanted to feel better. And I was learning chemical imbalances. This is what we do to get rid of depression and OCD. You're supposed to take your pills. And so I was taking my pills."
No, I was in psychotherapy. I had been in psychotherapy on and off for years. I had received much more intensive treatment when I was younger. And that was essentially worthless for me. It actually probably just caused harm at the end of the day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Psychoanalysis?
No," They were horrible. They did nothing beneficial for me. I gave them a decent amount of time to work. I really wanted to feel better. So at the time that I tried this diet, I certainly wasn't impaired in the same way. I wasn't struggling that much."
No," But I was still have these low grade symptoms, was trying to feel better. And the thing that was the most striking to me, after doing the diet for three months, was not the fact that my metabolic syndrome was gone. That was my goal, and it was a seemingly miraculous achievement because I got rid of everything"
No," with one dietary change. But the thing that I noticed was dramatic improvement in my mood, energy, concentration, and sleep. I for the first time in my life, I started waking up before my alarm went off and feeling rested. That never happened to me before."
No," But that was shocking to me, that I felt so good. And one of the things that I've often said to people, prior to the diet, I always felt like there are two types of people in the world. There are ""haves"" and ""havenots."" There are these happy, peppy people, who just are so positive, and they've got energy."
No," And they have the saying, they like to work hard and play hard. And I always understood working hard. I totally got that because I was a hard worker and I understood the value of hard work. And you got to do something useful with yourself. But I never understood who the hell wants to play hard,"
No," like who's got energy for that? Aren't you tired from working so hard? How on Earth do these people have energy to go and play hard? And I assumed that they were just part of the ""haves"" in the world. And they were just lucky and privileged."
No," CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas, the rest and by the way, I really appreciate you sharing some of your personal story because I think it is very important for people to hear and understand that people like yourself, who are extremely high functioning and accomplished,"
No," and that there is an important need for tools to overcome that suffering. So I really just hear you. Even early in our discussion, I just want to extend a genuine thanks because so much of what I hear from people is questions about health, and mental health, and physical health."
No," this in a professional context? CHRIS PALMER: Not yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So what was the journey forward into the work that you're doing now? CHRIS PALMER: So the next step was that I just had friends and family who saw me,"
No," How are you resisting all of this food? And I said, I don't crave it anymore. I don't want it, I'm fine. I'm just I'm having turkey and green beans. And that's good enough for me. So I got them to do the diet. And they too noticed dramatic improvement in their moods,"
No," and energy, and sleep, and everything else. So within a few years, the primary thing I noticed is this powerful antidepressant effect. And now, I'm an attending physician. I've got all these patients in my clinical practice with treatment resistant mental illness. I'm in a tertiary care hospital."
No," So I almost never get somebody off the street with their first episode of depression. Out of the gate, as part of my career, I get treatment resistant mental disorders. So I get people who've already been to 6plus psychiatrists, therapists. They've usually tried dozens of different medications."
No," They've been in decades of psychotherapy. They've often had ECT and other things. And nothing's working. And I'm thinking, well, we're kind of out of options for these other people. And this diet is having this really powerful antidepressant effect."
No," One woman actually became hypomanic within a month. And she had been depressed pretty much nonstop for over five years chronically depressed, suicidal, in and out of hospitals. And I saw her become hypomanic. And I'm thinking, wow, this really is a powerful antidepressant effect."
Environment," This is amazing. This is like a medication but better because it actually is working for her. But I laid low at that point because, at that point, we didn't have many clinical trials of the safety or efficacy of the Atkins diet for even weight loss or diabetes, let alone any mental disorders."
No," And so I really actually felt like I'm on the fringe here. And this is not going to be met with praise by anyone. So I'm just going to lay low. I'm going to offer it to patients. And I went along that way up until 2016. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And may I just ask about the diet? When you say ""Atkins diet,"" so this is low to zero starch,"
No," so low carbohydrate diet, certainly low sugar. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And was it traditional Atkins? Were you tailoring it to the individual patient depending on their psychiatric symptoms, whether or not they were overweight or not overweight? I'm assuming you're not a nutritionist,"
No," CHRIS PALMER: So early on, I was winging it. And I was the first few patients, it was try this Atkins diet. I want to see ketosis, so I was going for ketones. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So they were pricking their finger, and they were doing a blood ketone test? CHRIS PALMER: I didn't know about blood ketone monitors"
No," ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: So I was strongly recommending that patients achieve urinary ketosis. And the interesting thing is I noticed a pattern, that when they were trying the diet and not getting ketones, they often did not get a clinical benefit. It was once they got into ketosis"
No," that I began to notice the clinical benefit and the powerful antidepressant effect. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So probably any nutrition plan, a.k.a diet, that elevated ketones in the urine to the point where you would say, this person is in ketosis or they would say I'm in ketosis that was a step in the right direction,"
No," CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. And as the years went on, the field was advancing, more research was coming out. People were getting a little more sophisticated with blood ketone monitoring, with different versions of ketogenic diets. And I was evolving my practice."
No," CHRIS PALMER: It can be. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So I have it backwards. CHRIS PALMER: So schizoaffective disorder is essentially schizophrenia and plus some mood episodes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah, maybe I'm thinking of schizotypal? CHRIS PALMER: Schizotypal is the low grade,"
No," kind of mild paranoia, or kind of eccentric beliefs, and other things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Folks out there, I have my nomenclature backwards. Schizotypal is the, quote unquote, lower ""low level"" schizophrenia or schizoidlike. Schizoaffective is as or more severe."
No," He had daily auditory hallucinations. He had paranoid delusions. He could not go out in public without being terrified. He was convinced that there were these powerful families, that they had technologies that could control his thoughts. They could broadcast his thoughts to other people. They were trying to hurt him."
No," They had targeted him for some reason. He wasn't quite sure why. He had some suspicions and beliefs about maybe when he did this bad thing when he was 11 years old, that's why they decided to target him. This man was tormented by his illness, tormented. It ruined his life."
No," I have nothing going for me. But I could at least try to address one of these awful, horrible things about myself. And maybe I could lose some weight. So he asked for my help. For a variety of reasons, we ended up deciding to try the ketogenic diet."
No," Now, at this point, I have no anticipation that the ketogenic diet is going to do anything for his psychiatric symptoms because this man has schizoaffective disorder. That's not depression. Depression is very different. They're totally different disorders."
No," So he decides to give it a try. Within two weeks, not only does he start losing weight, but I begin to notice this dramatic antidepressant effect. He's making better eye contact. He's smiling more. He's talking a lot more. I'm thinking like, what's gotten into you?"
No," you know, those voices that I hear all the time? They're going away. And he says, you know how I always thought that there were all these families who were controlling my thoughts and out to get me, and they had targeted me? And I'm thinking, oh, yeah. We've been talking about that for eight years."
No, who's suffering from all the sorts of things that you described. How does somebody like that organize themselves in order to stay on a ketogenic diet? And I say this with all the seriousness in the world. I think there are a lot of people who do not have schizotypal or schizoaffective disorder
No," who have trouble, they claim, adhering to a ketogenic diet. It's not the easiest diet. Certainly in its extreme form at first, it's not the easiest diet to stick to. So how did he do it? That sounds like a remarkable individual. And I'd also like to just know your general thoughts"
No," about adherence to things when people are back on their heels mentally. How do they get motivated and stick to something? So the questions were, medication, yes or no? If yes, dosage adjusted, yes or no. And if people are suffering from depression or fullblown psychotic episodes,"
No," how does one ensure that they continue to adhere to a diet? CHRIS PALMER: So in terms of medications, he has remained on medication. So early on, I wasn't adjusting anything. I was just in disbelief and shock that this was happening. I didn't know what was going on. Over the years, we have slowly but surely"
No, tried to taper him off his meds. He has been on meds for decades. He started medications when he was a young child. His brain is as developed in response to all sorts of psychiatric medications. And it has not been easy to try to get him off. We continue to try to get him off medication.
No," And it's challenging and difficult. And I just want to say for any listeners, it is getting off your meds is very difficult and dangerous. And you need to do it with supervision, with a mental health professional or a prescriber because it is dangerous. When people reduce their meds too much,"
No, they can get wildly symptomatic. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that true for depression as well? CHRIS PALMER: It's true for any psychiatric medication. The brain makes adaptations in response to psychiatric medications. And when you stop them cold turkey some people are fine.
No," and cautiously, and gradually. So that's the medication piece. The adherence piece was not easy for him and for other patients. It is very rare that I have a patient who I can say, do the ketogenic diet. Come see me in 3 months, and let me know how it was going. That almost never happens."
Environment," and making micro adjustments or macro adjustments to medication or nutrition, could be meaningful. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. So with this particular patient, early on, he was actually pretty adherent. I was seeing him once a week. And so I could do a lot of education."
No," I was weighing him. I was checking his ketones. I was checking his glucose levels. At that point, I had a blood ketone monitor in my office. So I knew whether he was compliant or not, which is so beneficial in doing clinical work and research on this diet."
No," It's the only diet where within seconds, I can have an objective biomarker of compliance or noncompliance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Such a key point and again, brings to mind, for me, the parallel with medication. A patient can say they're taking their medication, and unless they're in a hospital setting, where somebody's checking under their tongue and all of this,"
No, they very well could not be taking it or taking more. And you and I both know that blood draws for neurotransmitter levels are complicated because you want to know what's in the brain and what's functional in the brain. And then we have to imagine that most people there prescribed drugs for any number of different psychiatric
No," I don't any longer. But I've tried, in the past, the socalled cyclic ketogenic diet, where every third or fourth day, get some pasta, or rice, et cetera. That was interesting as an experiment. But to stay in ketosis, what sort of blood levels of ketones do you like to see in your patients?"
No," What is the range that you think most people could aspire to? CHRIS PALMER: So it really depends on the patient and what I'm treating, quite honestly. And I don't think every patient needs the ketogenic diet. For some patients, simply getting rid of junk food can make a huge difference in a mood disorder, for instance. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So a junk food, meaning, highly processed food,"
No," for metabolic health. And lo and behold, we've got emerging data that suggests, that strongly suggests, it's also bad for mental health. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders. And so we have the best data for those disorders. But we actually have a lot of data with even bipolar disorder and schizophrenia that insulin resistance, in particular,"
No," and insulin signaling in the brain is impaired in people with chronic mental disorders kind of across the board all the way from chronic anxiety, depression, to bipolar, to schizophrenia, and even Alzheimer's disease. We know that patients with all of those disorders have impaired glucose metabolism and that the insulin signaling"
No," with schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, especially if it's chronic, if I'm using it as a brain treatment, then I do want a ketogenic diet. And I usually want reasonably high levels of blood ketones. Usually, for depression, I want to see at least greater than probably 0.8 minimal."
No," to see some mental health benefits from changing their diet. You make very clear in your book and we'll go into this in more detail that avoiding insulin resistance, reversing insulin resistance, and essentially trying to reverse what earlier you described"
No," as this metabolic syndrome, which is a bunch of different things, is the target. And for some people, getting rid of highly processed foods and focusing mainly on nonprocessed or minimally processed foods will really help. For others, going straight to the fullblown ketogenic diet will be of most benefit."
No," I'd like to back up a little bit in history and get to something which I find incredibly interesting, which is epilepsy and the longstanding use of ketogenic diet and fasting to treat epilepsy. And the reason I want to kind of rewind to that point in history is that, I think that for a lot of listeners and people out there who are familiar with how changing your diet"
Environment," or changing your exercise can positively impact sleep and weight and all these things, and it cascades into feeling better that makes perfect sense. But for a lot of the world still, the idea that changing or using nutrition as a dissection tool or as a treatment tool to understand and treat"
No, we acknowledge our East Coast CHRIS PALMER: You're the Harvard ANDREW HUBERMAN: friends. CHRIS PALMER: of the West Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We're not going to talk OK. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS]
No," the notion of using diet, they immediately think, ah, well, that makes perfect sense. Or I think there's a category of people who think, well, yeah, didn't Atkins die of a heart attack? I hear that a lot. That was crazy. People immediately discard the Atkins diet"
No," for that reason, which I do think is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. But it's an interesting thing nonetheless. And then I think that the majority of people sit in the middle and just want to see science and medicine come up with treatments that work. And I have to say, I'm very relieved to hear what you said"
No," earlier, which was you never said that people should come off their medication and just become go on a ketogenic diet and everything will be cured. You're certainly not saying that. CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And rather you're saying, if I understand correctly,"
No," that nutrition needs to be considered one of the major tools in the landscape of effective tools and that it can be very effective, evidenced by the story that you shared. And there are many other stories in there as well of truly miraculous transformations. So let's talk about epilepsy and how the ketogenic diet is not"
No," But the thing that immediately got me credibility was I didn't focus on it as a diet. I did a deep dive into the epilepsy literature. So the ketogenic diet, unbeknownst to most people, was actually developed a hundred years ago, 1921, by a physician for one and only one purpose to treat epilepsy."
No," It wasn't developed as a weight loss diet. It wasn't developed as the diet that all human beings should follow. And the reason it was developed is because of this longstanding observation, since the time of Hippocrates, that fasting can stop seizures. Now, fasting is not a healthy diet."
No," Fasting is the process of no diet. So we now understand a tremendous amount of science. Most people think going without food is bad. And they equate it with starvation. But in fact, when we go without food, it causes tremendous shifts in metabolism both brain and body metabolism."
No," And it puts the body into a mode of autophagy, and conservation of resources, and all sorts of things that are beneficial to human health. And this is why fasting has been used as a therapeutic intervention in almost every culture, in almost every religion for a millennia. But for the most part, that was all"
No," on a child with seizures and found that, oh, Lo and behold, this religious folklore stuff has something to it. It actually worked. The problem with fasting is that you can only fast for so long before you starve to death. And that's not a very effective treatment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And this child was ingesting water, correct?"
No," CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was just food elimination fasting. CHRIS PALMER: Food elimination. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. CHRIS PALMER: So no special diet. But the problem with fasting for epilepsy is that as soon as people start eating a normal diet again,"
No," their seizures usually come right back oftentimes, with a vengeance. And so it can be a good shortterm intervention. The fasting can take a few days because it can take a few days to get ketosis. And then you can get some relief from chronic seizures. But it's not a good longterm treatment"
No," because, again, people will starve to death. As soon as they start eating, seizures come back. So it was actually Dr. Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic who developed the ketogenic diet with one and only one purpose. He wanted to see, can we mimic the fasting state, using this special diet, to see if it might stop seizures longterm? And lo and behold, it worked."
No," Early results were extraordinarily positive. 50% of patients who use the ketogenic diet became seizurefree. And another 35% had a 50% or greater reduction in their seizure frequency, so about 85% efficacy rate. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry to interrupt. I didn't mean to do that there."
No," Was it just for pediatric epilepsy or for adult epilepsy as well? CHRIS PALMER: So back in the 1920s, we didn't have many antiepilepsy treatments. And a lot of adults were struggling as well. So they were using it on anybody who would do the diet. By the 1950s, pharmaceuticals were coming out."
No," And we had many more anticonvulsant treatments. And there's no question, they work for a lot of people. That's great. And taking a pill is so much easier than doing this diet. So the diet pretty much fell out of favor. And nobody was using it from the 1950s to about the '70s. But lo and behold, even to this day, people with epilepsy,"
No," about 30% don't respond to the current treatments that we have available. 30% will have treatment resistant epilepsy, which means they continue to have seizures no matter how many anticonvulsants they're taking, even if they've had brain surgery. It just doesn't stop their seizures."
No," And so in the 1970s, the ketogenic diet was resurrected at Johns Hopkins for these treatmentresistant cases. And lo and behold, it works not for all of them, but it works in about 1/3 become seizurefree. And these are people who've tried everything and nothing's"
No," or if that's because the diet's just not working. But about a third, a third, a third seizure freedom, reduction in seizures, or it just doesn't work. And so the reality, the godsend for me is that we have decades of neuroscience research on the ketogenic diet and what it is doing to the brain."
No," We know that the ketogenic diet is influencing neurotransmitter levels in particular, glutamate, GABA, adenosine. It changes calcium channel regulation and calcium levels, which is really important in the function of cells. It changes gene expression. It reduces brain inflammation."
No, It changes the gut microbiome. Gut microbiome is a huge topic right now. And there are some researchers who argue that is the primary benefit of the ketogenic diet it's changing the gut microbiome in beneficial ways. So it's doing a lot of things. It obviously improves insulin resistance.
No," It lowers glucose levels, lowers insulin levels, which improves insulin signaling. The key for my research that I've outlined, the real magic, is that this diet stimulates two processes that relate to mitochondria. It stimulates a process called mitophagy, which is getting rid of old and defective mitochondria,"
No," and replacing them with new ones. And it also stimulates a process called mitochondrial biogenesis, which means that after people have done the ketogenic diet for a while months or years many of their cells in their bodies and brains will have more mitochondria. And those mitochondria will be healthier."
No," And I believe that is the reason the ketogenic diet is such a powerful treatment not only for epilepsy but also for people with chronic mental disorders. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Would you mind listing off a few of the mental disorders? And I know this is not meant to be inside ball, but we should distinguish between psychiatric disorders"
No," We have a lot of mechanistic science papers by some of the leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists in the world and neurologists in the world kind of outlining, this is everything we know that the ketogenic diet is doing. These are the problems in the brains of people with these chronic mental or neurological"
No," disorders. So we know that they should work. But the disorders range from chronic depression to we've got a trial underway for PTSD. We've got one actually decent pilot trial from the National Institutes of Health for the ketogenic diet for alcohol use disorder,"
No," of all things. And we can go into that a little more. We've got a couple of pilot trials of the ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's disease. And those are randomized controlled trials. We've got case studies of the ketogenic diet for chronic depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia."
No," The largest study that we've got in that mental health sphere is a pilot study of 31 patients admitted to a French hospital. 28 of those patients were able to do the diet and stay on the diet. So 10%, off the bat, noncompliant, couldn't do the diet. So we need to include that."
No," But of the 28 patients who were able to do and these are 28 patients with treatmentresistant mental disorders, chronic depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Of the patients who were able to do the ketogenic diet, 100% had at least some improvement in symptoms. 46% had remission of illness. Remission of illness, that does not"
No," happen with current treatments. And 64%, I think, were discharged on less medicine than they went into the hospital on. So it wasn't that the people were prescribing more medicine and that's why. They were being discharged on less medication. We've got at least"
No," with the mental health field and its connection with epilepsy, the reason that it's such an important connection is that we use epilepsy treatments in psychiatric patients every day in tens of millions of people. So a lot of people don't know this, but I'll list off some names that a lot of your listeners"
No," may have heard of. And they probably know them as psychiatric drugs. But in fact, these are epilepsy drugs. Depakote, Tegretol, Lamictal, Topamax, Neurontin or gabapentin, Valium, Klonopin, Xanax those are all medications that stop seizures. And many of them were developed initially for seizures."
No," But we, in the mental health field, quickly steal them and start using them in tens of millions of people, even if they're off label. So that means, we don't have research studies documenting that they're effective. But we go ahead and use them anyway because the reality is far too many patients aren't getting"
No," better with the FDAapproved treatments that we do have to offer. So psychiatrists are just winging it in some cases. And we're just throwing whatever we can at them and we absolutely include epilepsy treatments. So in many ways, using the ketogenic diet as a treatment for serious mental disorders,"
No," is nothing new at all. It's an established evidencebased treatment for epilepsy. We use evidencebased treatments for epilepsy across the board for a wide range of mental disorders. And so in many ways, that's all I'm doing with the ketogenic diet."
No," It just happens to be a diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. I love it. And I should say, I love it because we had a guest on here early days of the podcast. He's a colleague of mine at Stanford. He's a bioengineer, and a psychiatrist, phenomenal"
No," and there are these tools of altering brain chemistry, which are of the sorts of drugs you just listed off, or antidepressants, or antipsychotics, that fall into these major bins of adjusting dopamine or adjusting serotonin or some combination of dopamine, serotonin epinephrine, adenosine, and on, and on, and on."
Environment," And a tool for altering brain chemistry. If I think about the landscape, the sort of sociology out there of again, there seem to be these bins, like a third of people saying, of course, diet, and exercise, and social connection, and limiting stress, that's the good stuff."
No," That's the stuff that we really works. And then about a third of people are sort of unclear. And then a third of people think, well, if it's not a prescription drug, then it just has no place in medicine. And hopefully, that's changing. And certainly, the work that you're doing"
No," is going to be important in that transition that I think we will see. I'd like to talk about mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. I think most people learn that the mitochondria are the energy factories of cells and that indeed, they are. As a neuroscientist, what I know about them is that they are present everywhere in neurons."
No," or several meters rather. And that mitochondria do a lot of stuff besides just produce energy, because I think people hear ""mitochondria,"" ""energy,"" and they think, oh, so these patients felt better. They lost weight. They had more energy."
No," And then they're doing better. But here we're talking about remission of auditory hallucinations, people feeling suicidal and then changing their diet and feeling like life is something they can deal with, and maybe even function extremely well, and et cetera. So maybe we could just talk about mitochondria"
No," in the metabolic field in the aging field. And we can start to pair it with a mental health and neurological health field. So mitochondria one scientist gave me this analogy. He said, if you think of the cell as a computer, a lot of people think of mitochondria as the power cord to that computer"
No," part of the Krebs, citric acid cycle. Some of the intermediate products actually go into making those neurotransmitters. Much more importantly, mitochondria provide the energy for the production of those neurotransmitters. And fascinatingly, mitochondria are directly related"
No," So I've just talked about neurotransmitters, hormones, epigenetic expression, inflammation. For anybody familiar with the mental health field, they know these are some of the key variables that researchers have been struggling with for decades, trying to figure out how do these fit together. We know that all of those buckets"
No," to being important sources of energy production and output in cells which, of course, they are probably have other roles. Maybe someday, what we call mitochondria will actually be two or three different little subcellular or organelles. There may be little bits in there"
Environment," that are controlling gene expression and little bits in there that are controlling neurotransmitter production. But at least for now, the name is mitochondria. And thank you, by the way, for illustrating some of the other things that they do because in the landscape of science education, oftentimes, people will think, OK, energy production."
No," There'll be a picture or a cartoon of mitochondria flexing its muscles. People go, OK, energy, mitochondria, mighty mitochondria. And then they'll think, oh, they're just sort of like a dumb jock portion of the cell. They're not doing anything sophisticated."
No," And then those degradation products get used for either energy or to build new things. Autophagy is always occurring at a low level. But you can really hyperstimulate the process through fasting, calorie restriction, fastingmimicking diets, other things. And this is why fasting and calorie restriction"
Environment," for you comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And where all the noise about antioxidants CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like in the '90s, it was like, it contains antioxidants. Not to say antioxidants are bad, but they are certainly not the beallendall of health."
No," We don't want defective mitochondria and how can we get rid of old ones or defective ones and replace them with new ones. And I think the most powerful signal and tool that we have right now is, in fact, related to diet. It's calorie restriction. That is the oldest, truest, kind of bestproven way to prevent"
No," aging in a wide variety of animal species fasting and intermittent fasting. And again, you can only do those things for so long. And then fastingmimicking diets can also stimulate this process of mitophagy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we talk about mitochondrial biogenesis, if"
No," and I certainly accept the idea that mitochondria are extremely important in physical health and mental health. That's, for me, is a straightforward conclusion at this point, based on what you've said, whatever and elsewhere, et cetera. And if various diets, including ketogenic diet, including"
No," fasting, reducing sugar intake, et cetera, can assist in mitochondrial function and mitophagy and that's at least one of the levers by which diet can positively impact mental health and physical health, can we conclude that there's something special about low blood glucose in the brain? The sort of common pathway of all of those things fasting,"
No," ketogenesis for some people, maybe they maybe some people have great insulin management, so just removing sweets, refined sugars, brings down their blood glucose level substantially. They don't need to go on a ketogenic diet in order to relieve a low level depression"
Environment," was published in Neuron, if you just look at the tuning of a neuron, how well a neuron in the brain represents some visual image in the environment in terms here, we can just generalize and say, more action potentials, more electrical signals from the neuron generally correlates with better high fidelity representation."
No," So how do I get my head around this? You've got me sold on mitochondria not that I needed to be sold. But that's an easy yes, yes, absolutely, yes. The idea that diet can impact mental health and physical health yes, absolutely by way of mitochondria at least in part, great."
Environment, But I tend to do some very hard training at some point during the day. So I imagine I have some glycogen to repack. OK. That's me. I only mentioned that because I'm not in ketosis as far as I know.
No," Do you think and here, feel free to speculate. Do you think that those people might feel far better or even a little bit better if they were in a lower glucose state? And I ask this because I think there are a lot of people out there who suffer from fullblown depression."
No," But there are also a lot of people who suffer from moodiness and feeling not so great, subclinical depression. CHRIS PALMER: Yes, burnout is what I would call it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, or just feeling some days are great, and then other days, they feel lousy for reasons they don't understand."
No," what's the actual root cause and what are effective treatments. And I really see them as two separate things. Just because the ketogenic diet is an effective treatment, does not imply that the cause of the problem was eating carbohydrates. And I think that's a really important distinction."
No," There are many people who disagree with me on that. There's no doubt about it. And everybody's heard people say, sugar is the cause of everything that ails you. Or carbs are the cause of everything that ails you. If everybody does a low carb diet or a ketogenic diet and then they go to, so it must be sugar that was the cause."
No," I don't see it as clearly black and white as that. Calorie restriction, ketogenic diet, carbohydrate restriction are inducing metabolic changes in the brain and body. And regardless of what the person was eating, they are inducing metabolic changes that can be really beneficial to brain health."
No, So let me just give a clear black and white example of this. And then I can speak to the broader topic that you brought up about just the general population. The easy example of the ketogenic diet being an effective intervention for somebody who was not following a bad diet is an infant with epilepsy.
No," The mother's breast milk is, in fact, the optimal food source for that infant. And yet that infant is still seizing. If we put that infant on a ketogenic diet, a lot of those infants seizures will stop. It doesn't mean that the cause of the infant seizures was a bad diet."
No," We don't know what causes obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They don't think excess caloric intake beyond one's daily metabolic needs is causing obesity? CHRIS PALMER: Some will argue that. And so some will say yes, it's all energy balance. But why do we have an epidemic of obesity?"
No," ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm rewatching the Mad Men series now. I love that series, and I'm rewatching it. And I happen to know someone who worked on that series. They researched everything for the props, and the costumes, everything, right down to diet. And if you look at the diet, it was terrible. It was mostly yes, there was a lot"
No," of excessive amounts of drinking and cigarette smoking. But the diets were terrible. It was prepackaged foods. It was frozen dinners. That really came to prominence in the '70s and '80s. But even in the '50s and, from what I've been reading, even in the '30s and '40s, people were not"
Environment," But I actually think we've got a tremendous amount of evidence that continues to point in this direction. I believe that mitochondria are the key to the obesity epidemic, that there is something in our environment. So that is either our food, environmental toxins, stress levels, poor sleep, not getting adequate sunlight, whatever"
Environment," people. I know one, he's actually an employee at Stanford. He's in our media team at Stanford. And this guy, when I take him to lunch, it's like he's in his early 70s, and he can eat. And he's incredibly lean. He exercises a little bit."
Environment," CHRIS PALMER: They're getting increasingly rare. And that leads me to think it may be epigenetic factors in the womb environment, so that kids are actually coming out predisposed to obesity. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let me ask you about that because I had a note here to ask this later. But I'm going to interrupt you now in order"
No," have entire regions of our brain that carry neurons that are of purely of mom's or of dad's DNA, depending on the brain region. This is a wild finding. But it's accurate. And this has actually been known about in terms of heritability of disease, et cetera."
No," Maternal DNA, DNA from mom, genes from our mother not to place blame on mothers at all. My understanding is that the mitochondrial DNA come exclusively through the maternal side. Is that true? CHRIS PALMER: So it's a great question. And I've been asked this before."
No," So that is what you're inheriting from your mom. It's the mitochondria and those 36 genes for the most part. But the majority of proteins that make up mitochondria, over, I think, 1,300 genes that make up mitochondria are actually encoded in the nuclear DNA. And so you inherit a copy from both your mother and your father."
No, So the majority of people who have mitochondrial defects or rare mitochondrial diseases actually could inherit them from either mom or dad because it can be a defect in the nuclear genes that code for proteins that make up mitochondria. The much bigger issue when so when I talk about mitochondrial dysfunction
No," being a primary driver of mental illness, metabolic illness, it's not that people inherit a defective mitochondrion or mitochondria from mom, and then that just ruins their life forever. That's actually not the way it works. The beautiful thing about this theory is that it connects all of the risk factors"
No," that we already know play a role in mental health but also metabolic health. Sleep disruption impairs mitochondria and mitochondrial function. Stress, high levels of stress and trauma, impair mitochondrial function. Drug and alcohol use, alcohol, tobacco definitely"
No," So that means their brain tissue is aging prematurely. It's shrinking prematurely. But the CB1 receptors on mitochondria also seem to play a role in the memory impairment that can be induced from THC. And they also play a role in the kind of lack of motivation, the behavioral amotivational state"
No," so you can get it back, but if you keep doing it chronically, you're probably not helping your overall mental or metabolic health. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I'm glad you brought up THC. We did an episode on cannabis. We also did one on alcohol probably lost some friends from that one."
No," When you look at the data, it's very clear. I'm not arguing that people dislike the effects of these compounds when they take them. But it is clear that, at least to me, based on the data that regardless of what people have read about red wine, that not drinking any alcohol is going to be healthier than drinking alcohol,"
No," and that the thresholds for alcohol ingestion before people start to negatively impact their health is about one or two per week. And then THC, because of the very high concentrations of THC that are present in a lot of products now vaping and smoking THC and even edibles that it can be problematic."
No," You mentioned adolescents that predisposition, and brain atrophy, psychosis, et cetera. In any case, because you mentioned alcohol because it is a commonly used substance, I heard you give a talk in which I think I have this right in which alcohol can disrupt the way that the brain uses fuels of all kinds,"
No," which may disrupt one's response to alcohol, make alcohol seem more rewarding to those that drink alcohol. So drinking alcohol makes alcohol more rewarding to the brains of alcohol drinkers, but that it also might alter glucose metabolism, that basically alcohol is not good for our brains. Do I have that correct?"
No," CHRIS PALMER: You do have that correct. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. What happens if you take an alcoholic or somebody that just drinks two to four nights a week a couple of drinks, which I think is pretty common out there, and you put them on a ketogenic diet? Has that experiment been done?"
No," of Drug Abuse. She's been hot on the trail of metabolic abnormalities in the brains of people with alcohol use disorder, which I will just refer to as alcoholics because that's what everybody knows it as. So she's been hot on this trail for many, many years. And as you said, it turns out that the reward pathways,"
No," in particular, are metabolically compromised in alcoholics. And the metabolic compromise essentially, in a nutshell, means they aren't getting enough fuel from glucose. The interesting thing is that when people drink alcohol, your liver converts alcohol into a molecule called acetate. That acetate travels up to the brain and fuels brain cells, in particular, some of these reward"
No, pathway cells more than others. And so chronic alcoholics have this chronic deprivation of energy in these cells. And so Nora Volkow and other researchers at the National Institutes of Health did a study in which they set out to see if we can change this brain metabolic problem in alcoholics.
No," Will that affect clinical symptoms of alcoholism? And will it do anything? It's clinically useful. And so they actually did a pilot randomized controlled trial, admitted alcoholics to a detox unit. Half of the patients got a ketogenic diet. The other half got the standard American diet."
No," And then everybody else, all of them got the same detox protocol. The patients who got the ketogenic diet required fewer benzodiazepines for their detox. Despite that, they had fewer withdrawal symptoms from the alcohol. They reported fewer cravings for alcohol."
No," would think alcoholism has nothing to do with diet, alcohol is just drinking too much. It's a matter of willpower. Or it's somebody who's addictive. They've got an addictive personality, and it's that simple. You come out of the womb with an addictive personality."
No," But this is one of the leading neuroscientists in the world who's hot on this trail. This is what she believes. And this is what I believe. It's that if we can correct the brain metabolic defects from chronic alcohol use, we might be able to help people be sober and give them a fighting"
No," chance. Or give them an edge up or pull a lever that we can use in their favor, for their benefit. There's one caution to all of this research that I really do want to highlight. And so now, I'm going to get hate mail from all the keto community."
No, what will happen to alcohol levels if an animal consumes alcohol while on a ketogenic diet. So they didn't do this in humans yet. This is a fairly easy study to do. So I'm hoping somebody will do this study soon. But they instead put rats half of them on a standard diet and half of them on a ketogenic diet.
No," And then they exposed them to the exact same amount of alcohol. The rats who were on the ketogenic diet had a fivefold increase in blood alcohol levels. Fivefold increase. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Meaning, they drank more? Or"
No," CHRIS PALMER: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: it was metabolized differently. CHRIS PALMER: It was metabolized differently. The rats all got the same amount of alcohol. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people out there who are ketogenic, I'm chuckling, but who are not alcoholics please, alcoholics, please do something about it"
No, because it's so detrimental. But I guess does this mean that they can drink less in order to get the effect of alcohol that most people are seeking? CHRIS PALMER: Cheap dates. Cheap date is what you call that. You only need a half a drink instead of three drinks. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I would think the keto community would thank
No," you for this unless they somehow have a stake in the alcohol industry. CHRIS PALMER: The reason that I put it as a caution is that if anybody is struggling with alcoholism and thinks hey, I need an edge up. I need a lever to pull because I'm really struggling to give this stuff up."
No," I just find myself going back. And if you're telling me my brain metabolism is messed up, and this might help it, I'm all in favor of that. And yes, that's what the researchers are pursuing. And that's what I'm saying with the following caveat that if you relapse while on a ketogenic diet, you better not drink the same amount of alcohol"
No," And they think that they can handle two drinks safely. And they think, well, I can go out for dinner and have two glasses of wine and drive home safely. I know myself. If you go to a ketogenic diet, please don't drive with the same two drinks because it means your blood alcohol level"
No," if it models anything that we found in the rat study your blood alcohol levels may be five times higher than they would normally be. And that means you are really wasted. And you're probably not safe to be driving. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably the same is true for drinking on an empty stomach, right?"
No," And I guess that raises the question of, when one goes on a ketogenic or low blood glucose diet or fast, has anyone observed changes in the brain? Has anyone had neuroimaging of humans and their brains under conditions of ingesting one diet or another, whether or not they're psychiatric suffering from a psychiatric disorder or not?"
No," And so some people are calling it type III diabetes. At the end of the day, I think the clearest signal that we have is that cells aren't getting enough energy from glucose as a fuel source. That is something that I think I can confidently say that's backed by numerous research studies. There's debate in the research field"
No," CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, ketone esters or ketone salts. And it has actually found that these brain metabolism deficits can be corrected, at least shortterm, by giving a ketone supplement. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is this in the context of people also ingesting some carbohydrate? Because I confess, I've tried the ketogenic diet."
Environment," I probably did it wrong. This was years ago. And then the cyclic ketogenic diet. But in the last year or so, I've started using liquid ketone esters. And I do eat some carbohydrates each day, usually in proportion to how much high intensity exercise"
No," I'm doing. Those liquid ketone esters, for me at least subjectively I feel greatly increase my energy levels and my ability to focus mentally. And they improve my sleep. This is my observation tracking some data but just, again, subjectively."
No," So in this example, are you talking about people taking ketone esters or ketone salts on a backdrop of a ketogenic diet or on the backdrop of a more typical diet? CHRIS PALMER: So he's done both. So he's done studies where patients aren't doing anything special with the diet."
No," Sorry, I have we have to just PET, positron emission tomography, not pets. Although, I'm sure that there are people out there who have their dogs, or cats, or whatever, or their pet kangaroos, whatever you might own, on ketogenic diet. OK."
No," CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. So he's actually moved further. He's done a pilot trial in a nursing home actually, where he did not put the patients on a ketogenic diet. He simply reduced carbohydrate consumption at breakfast and lunch."
No," liquid ketones to people who are challenged with mood disorders or things of that sort could be beneficial, even if they are not willing or able to adhere to a ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER: That is the million dollar question right now. And we don't have good trial data to say yes or no."
No," My speculation, my hunch, having tried that clinically with patients, is it doesn't seem to work. It's not the same thing. The bigger reason for my feeling confident in saying that is that we've had ketone salts and esters available for over a decade now. We have tens of thousands of children and adolescents who"
No," are following a strict, ridiculously strict, ketogenic diet to control their epilepsy. Those kids would love to be off the ketogenic diet. Their parents would love to have them off the ketogenic diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER: There is not one case report of any child controlling his or her seizures using"
No, exogenous ketones without also doing the ketogenic diet. I just find it hard to believe that at least some of those people haven't tried it out to see. I do know some patients with bipolar disorder and even schizophrenia who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet. They have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet using
No," exogenous ketones. Their symptoms came back. And so they found that it just wasn't effective. Now, again, those are anecdotes. My scientific speculation about why is because the ketogenic diet is actually not necessarily about ketones themselves."
No," Ketones are one of a multifaceted story there. And so when people do a ketogenic diet, they're also improving they're lowering glucose levels. They're improving insulin signaling. They're ramping up mitochondrial biogenesis, in particular, in the liver because mitochondria actually make ketones."
No," That's where they're made. And they're primarily made in the liver mitochondria. So when somebody is on in a fasting state or on a ketogenic diet, their liver mitochondria go through the roof because they're being called to action. It's like, hey, body's in starvation mode. Get to work."
No," include you in that, I think ketones can play a really beneficial role, no doubt. I think exogenous ketones may, in fact, proven valuable in clinical use for patients who maybe can't follow a super strict ketogenic diet but maybe could do a low carb diet. And then given the research that's"
No," happening with alcohol use disorder, I could imagine a situation here's the million dollar tip to whoever wants to go out and get this, if it actually turns out to be true. I could imagine a scenario where we use exogenous ketones with alcoholics."
No," And that every time they have a severe craving for alcohol, they drink ketones instead. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which sort of tastes like alcohol. The ketone esters, when I take them, I drink them straight. Sometimes I'll put them in seltzer. And I'm not a big drinker, as I mentioned. I might have an alcoholic drink every once in a while."
No," I just don't ever crave it. I just do it every maybe I think 2020 was the last time I had a drink of alcohol. So obviously, I'm not a good representative example. But the ketones taste good to me. And they obviously don't get you drunk. They do seem to flick on my alertness pretty quickly."
No," it means that it doesn't have enough energy for maintenance and repair functions. As soon as you give that cell a hundred percent energy or close to it, even if you get it up to 90% of its preferred energy amount, it can start to repair itself. That's the beauty of the human body"
No," Thank you for that clarification. I'd like to talk about Alzheimer's and agerelated cognitive decline generally. I know many people out there are just terrified of losing their memory for the obvious reasons. Memory sets context, et cetera. And many people have relatives that"
No," suffer from Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. I've heard that the ketogenic diet and diets like it can be very effective for helping to offset some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's and agerelated cognitive decline. In fact, I even have a friend I won't out by institution, who's the chair of Cardiology, who contacted me,"
No," of all people, asking whether or not I was aware of any studies or whether or not I knew of anybody who had benefited from ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's. And I thought, well, why don't you ask one of your colleagues in neurology? But his response was really interesting. He said there are many books out there for the general public."
No," There are a lot of online discussions about this. There are a lot of assertions about this, and some animal studies. Again, these are his words. There are very few, if any, controlled clinical trials exploring the role of the ketogenic diet for the treatment or reversal of Alzheimer's"
No," And that's been frustrating to the community. So this is a very educated, very accomplished person who's a physician of heart medicine as opposed to something else related to the brain. But what is the story there. And for goodness' sake, why aren't there clinical trials on ketogenic diet and Alzheimer's?"
No," of small pilot clinical trials. The best one was a randomized controlled trial. I think it only included 26 subjects, something like that, randomized to 12 weeks of a low fat diet, 10week washout, 12 weeks of ketogenic diet. Some of the participants got keto first and then low fat. Other participants got low fat then keto."
No," And that trial actually found that when patients were in ketosis, they had statistically significant improvement in activities of daily living and quality of life. And they did have improvement in cognitive function. But it didn't reach statistical significance, that improvement did not."
No," We've got other trials. We've got several animal models showing that the ketogenic diet can improve biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in Alzheimer's models. So it can reduce plaques and tangles, can even improve cognitive impairment in animal models. And we've got a couple of other small pilot"
No," trials of ketogenic diet in humans, showing that it improves biomarkers compared to, say, the low fat diet or the American Heart Association diet. So we've got those. I think one of the biggest challenges that I'll just share openly"
No," and this is I'm somebody who's pretty passionate about this research. And I believe it has a lot of potential. But Johns Hopkins' researchers attempted to do exactly this kind of a study, Alzheimer's patients' ketogenic diet versus the, I think, American Academy of Aging"
No," or something like that diet, is the controlled diet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Which presumably has starches in there. CHRIS PALMER: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that's the key variable. CHRIS PALMER: Probably lots of yeah, lots of ANDREW HUBERMAN: And some potatoes"
No," ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. CHRIS PALMER: Despite that, what they found was that the subjects who achieved ketosis had cognitive improvement. But people on study section are going to look at a study like that and say, even if the science is there, if you can't get people to do this diet,"
No," why would we spend money on researchers trying to get people to do this diet? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I should mention, study section is this closed door panels of 40 or so people. There are many of these panels. Different divisions in the National Institutes of Health use different panels."
No," And then grants are evaluated in a very small, because of the size of the federal budget for research, a very small percentage. Usually, about 10% of these studies are funded. The rest generally don't end up happening. That is very informative. What you just described is very informative"
No," because now it makes sense to me. There's no conspiracy. It's not big pharma, I don't think, is trying to suppress trials of ketogenic diets on Alzheimer's because I would imagine the first thing that pharma would want to do is to see that study done."
No," I think pharma would probably be cheering from the sidelines because they could capitalize on it, because ultimately, the studies are done by scientists. But the treatments are generally doled out by pharmaceutical companies and/or physicians. So I don't believe there's a conspiracy there. That is very interesting."
No," And it's kind of amazing, given our discussion of earlier, which is that you had a patient that was having schizophrenic symptoms who managed to stay on this diet. So is there something special about Alzheimer's patients and people with agerelated cognitive decline? Presumably, they're very dependent on others"
Environment," to cook for them and shop for them. I think that this is almost perfect controlled environment for getting this study done. CHRIS PALMER: I think that is the key issue. So again, I got patients I get patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, extraordinarily impaired people to do this diet"
Environment," that the patient took the pill every day. We just assume they took the pill every day. And studies say they probably didn't. So I think when we think about a dietary intervention, we need to think about more intensive support and education. And that support could be a health and wellness coach."
Environment," It could be a dietician. It could be education of the family. It might even be providing them with dietary meals. That maybe for six months, we actually provide them with ketogenic meals once a week, put them in your freezer. Microwave them when needed"
No," to make this diet as easy and doable as possible. Because if we can get people to do the diet, if we can get them through the first couple of months, most people can learn how to do this diet. More importantly I didn't mention this before. But the number one reason I am so successful at getting patients to stay on this diet for years,"
No," is because of the consequences to them when they go off of it. That is the reason I can get schizophrenic patients and bipolar patients to do this diet, whereas other people can't get an everyday human being to do it for weight loss because the weight loss patient doesn't experience devastating tormenting symptoms when they break the diet."
No," And they never get around to it. My patients, when they go off the diet, they start hallucinating within 48 or 24, 48 hours. And they quickly realize that was a really stupid thing to do. That piece of cake was not at all worth"
No," the torment that I'm experiencing now. So they get back on the diet. I suspect with Alzheimer's disease, we might notice something similar. Some of these people have very mild symptoms. So maybe they won't have that kind of a reinforcement, negative reinforcing kind of experience."
No," But I think some of them will. Some of them recognize that they are impaired cognitively. And if this diet could help them remember better, if this diet could help them function better and again, that's what the pilot trial showed, is activities of daily living. That means these people are able to go"
No," to the bathroom on their own. They're able to get themselves dressed. Whereas, they needed help with those things before. Those are actually really important things to both the patient and the caregiver. And if they go off the diet and then quickly revert into a more symptomatic state,"
No," that might be reinforcing enough for them to figure out a way to do the diet on their own. And if we think about, if this really is an effective intervention and yes, we need longer trials, larger trials, all of that, because there are plenty of stories in the medical field where pilot trials looked really"
No," spectacular and promising. And then larger trials just failed to show the benefits. I believe, based on all the science of metabolism, mitochondria, glucose hypometabolism, all of that, I believe the science makes this an obvious treatment that has real potential. So people will call me biased."
No," But bias based on observation here, I should mention that most of what we know about human memory was sparked by one patient, a famous HM, who I think was living in Harvard Medical, in one of the hospitals around. There are many hospitals on Longwood Campus. But one patient, the reason we associate the hippocampus with memory is because we knew that HM's"
No," the hippocampus was intentionally damaged for epilepsy treatment. So this idea that everything has to be a randomized clinical trial, to me, is crazy. Of course, that's a gold standard. And it's essential. But there's so much information in textbooks, medical textbooks"
No," and in public communication, is assisting this. I have a question about or more of a statement/question about the ketogenic diet. Based on everything that we've talked about, seems to me that the ketogenic diet for weight loss is a very interesting aspect of the diet as is intermittent fasting for weight loss"
No," even though it might just be by way of caloric restriction that occurs with fasting. But then in some ways, the effects of the ketogenic diet on weight loss are a bit of a decoy for most people. That's where their mind goes. This person lost X amount of weight."
No," Maybe that made them feel better. Maybe that actually made them underweight. I think you've talked about it. For some people, it can actually bring them under weight. I'm glad that we got the chance to dive into the description of ketogenic diet for epilepsy because it really is a medical intervention that"
No," has a side effect of weight loss or could be used to treat obesity and induce weight loss. But it's really about far more than that. And that raises a question for me, which is we've been talking about the ketogenic diet as one thing. But I've heard you discuss this before, where just as a physician will prescribe different dosage"
No," ranges of a given drug, you can prescribe different dosage ranges of a nutritional plan, a diet. It's not one thing. It's not necessarily zero carbohydrates or 100 grams or 50 grams. It depends on the patient and a lot of other factors. I've heard you list off various things classic keto."
No," And I know in your book, you talk about not just the science and clinical background but also some actionable steps that people could consider. So they can refer there for more detail. But for somebody who, let's say, is depressed they've had some rounds of depression. Maybe they're on antidepressants, maybe not"
No," and they want to try something like this. Obviously, this has to be done in concert with a physician observing all this. But what is the typical thing that you probe with first? Just like with a drug, you might probe with 20 milligrams of a drug. What's your typical initial dietary intervention probe?"
No," What is their current diet like? And what are they willing to do? I try to meet them where they're at. So if somebody and I want to point out. You mentioned the allmeat version of this diet, which is often referred to as the carnivore diet."
No, ANDREW HUBERMAN: Very controversial diet. CHRIS PALMER: There is no doubt that exists. Some people swear by it. They swear they've tried other versions of ketogenic diets and only when they went to a carnivore diet did they get benefits. But there are vegetarian and vegan versions
No," of the ketogenic diet. So in my mind, this is not at all about the diet wars of animalsourced versus plantsourced foods. It's about inducing a state of ketosis, which is mimicking the fasting state. That is what it's about."
No," And you can do that by not eating anything, by fasting and/or intermittent fasting. And you get your results. So no diet is a ketogenic diet. So it's not about the foods or the types of foods that you're eating. It's about inducing a state of ketosis."
No," Usually, it is a goal of theirs to tap into some of those. And they'd like to lose some weight if they're going to try a ketogenic diet for brain health anyway. And so I'm going to use that. So that person, really, the diet is carbohydrate restriction. And that usually is a sufficient intervention."
No," And it'll make the diet easier and a little more sustainable. But let's say you can have your artificial sweeteners, if that's what you really want. So I'm going to say less than 20 grams of carbs a day for those people. They can have all the protein they want. They can have vegetables."
No," can people ingest, anyway, before they either develop diarrhea no joke or just sort of get tired of coconut oil? Anyway, your point is taken. But they can eat meat if they like meat? CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or they can eat eggs."
No," and drink it just because it tastes so, so good. CHRIS PALMER: It does taste good. So if they're on a ketogenic diet, I'm going to push them away from halfandhalf and toward heavy whipping cream. So you can whip that up. You can freeze it."
No," It turns into ice cream. You can add vanilla. You can add cocoa powder. You can add all sorts of things. And you're off to the races with shakes, and ice cream, and mousse, and all sorts of things that you can have. With any of these patients, the beauty of this diet"
No," is I have objective biomarkers. I'm going to have them measuring ketones. And I'm going to adjust the diet based on their state of ketosis and/or the clinical benefits that I'm looking for. If it's an average person, who is not currently under psychiatric care, not taking prescription medicines but is saying, I'm burned out."
No," I'm exhausted. I want some of that brain energy that Andrew Huberman is talking about. He talks about feeling good. I want some of that. I'm probably actually going to recommend the protocol you describe, which is,"
No," let's see if we can just carb restrict for a while and see if that produces clinical benefit. I have one he's not even a patient, just somebody who read my book. I didn't tell him anything. And he came away from it saying he was ready to start an antidepressant for his anxiety."
No," He had chronic anxiety, was trying meditation, was trying all sorts of things. Nothing those things weren't enough. He was ready to go on prescription medicine. He read an early copy of the book. He took it upon himself without consulting with me to restrict carbohydrates alone."
No," foods in my diet. So I think for some people, it can be that simple. For people with serious mental disorders, if they are chronically depressed, if they're on lots of prescription meds, if they're disabled by their symptoms, and certainly, if you're bipolar or have schizophrenia or something,"
No," those are the people I really do want them to work with a medical professional because meds may need to be adjusted. They need a real shot at this diet. It's not like weight loss. Weight loss, everybody wings it. And either you're successful or you aren't."
No, have a serious brain disorder. It's impairing your ability to function in the world. It's impairing your health and happiness. You deserve a competent medical treatment. And we have that. We have a hundredyear evidencebased. We've got dieticians who know this
No," like the back of their hand. They can monitor your level of ketosis. They can help look for vitamin and nutrient deficiencies that can be a consequence of the diet, and make sure that you're not developing those. They can help tweak the diet if needed. They can give you ideas if you're getting bored with eggs"
No," Is it ever the case that you'll prescribe somebody the ketogenic diet in conjunction with intermittent fasting? So eat keto but eat between the hours of, whatever, 11:00 AM and 8:00 PM or something like that. That's the first question. CHRIS PALMER: Absolutely."
No," And I have one patient with type 2 diabetes and chronic depression. And he will try to follow the ketogenic diet. And sometimes, his blood sugars are still very high. And sometimes I will ask him to do either intermittent fasting or even a three or four day water fast."
No," use the keto diet for weight loss, I have seen definite hypomania. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So these are people that aren't sleeping very much. Are they also getting kind of delusional, thinking they're going to run for president? CHRIS PALMER: No."
No, something every human being probably craves. So it is feeling extraordinarily good. It's getting by on less sleep. But you don't need to sleep. Who needs sleep? I've got things to do. My brain is running on all cylinders.
Environment," I'm obsessed with getting sufficient quality sleep. It's a kind of a repeating theme in our podcast and many of my social media posts. And I always recommend behavioral tools first, then exercise, viewing sunlight, et cetera, at appropriate times, avoiding late night artificial light exposure, et cetera, and occasionally,"
No," for people who are doing all that and still struggle with sleep, supplementation. One of the things that I've seen some data on is that for people who are following a low carbohydrate diet, that inositol, in particular, can be helpful for getting into sleep probably because it's a bit of an has"
No," a bit of an antianxiety effect. But presumably, there are other things out there, too. The magnesiums will generally do that. A hot bath will do that, too, for that matter. But what you're talking about is people who are going, what, a day and a half without sleep? Or they're just two hours of sleep a night?"
No," CHRIS PALMER: So the worst case I saw was actually a mental health professional who didn't recognize it initially. He went six months with two to four hours of sleep every night. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because they were on a ketogenic diet? CHRIS PALMER: He was on a ketogenic diet,"
No," was getting by on two to four hours of sleep every night, did not initially recognize that this was a problem. He was feeling great. He was feeling that keto high. And he was actually waking up at 4:00 AM, going for 10 to 20 mile runs most days. He finally stopped the ketogenic diet after about six months"
No," because he said, I can't maintain my weight. I'm losing too much weight. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just thinking there are some social media personalities associated with nutrition that might be hypomanic. I'll let you do the clinical evaluation."
No," And then at night, I switch over to mainly carbohydrate. It really helps me sleep. It replenishes glycogen stores. I sleep really well, wake up the next morning, repeat. And of course, this goes against a lot of the dogma that, oh, you're not supposed to eat carbohydrates late in the day and [MUMBLES]."
No," This is what works for me. And so I do it. For somebody like this mental health professional, who is hypomanic, would going off the ketogenic diet entirely be the best idea? Or could it be that adjusting when they eat their carbohydrates would be advantageous"
No," in order to make sure that they felt alert and great during the day? Maybe not hypomanic but then could have a four to eighthour a night sleep as opposed to a two to four hours a night, which is really very little sleep. CHRIS PALMER: Yeah, it's not ANDREW HUBERMAN: It can't be healthy."
No," CHRIS PALMER: It's not healthy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Even if you can do it and feel great, I imagine that the brain is suffering. CHRIS PALMER: It is. And the body is suffering. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And your friends and family are suffering."
No," CHRIS PALMER: The body is repairing itself with sleep. And so yeah, it's if it's somebody who is not a patient, they're not a mental health patient. They're not using the ketogenic diet as a mental health treatment. They're simply doing it for whatever."
Environment," I actually start with everything you've just outlined. Let's start with behavioral measures first. And the first intervention is education. You need at least six hours of sleep a night. Period, end of story. That's nonnegotiable. If you're not getting at least six hours of sleep a night,"
Environment," we need to consider this a problem. So figure out a way to get 6 hours of sleep. For some people, that's enough, just the education. They don't get out of bed at 3:00 AM. It might take them an hour to fall back to sleep. They fall back to sleep. For most people, if you can get three nights of decent sleep"
No," in a row, the hypomania goes away. That is the way to extinguish it. And then they still go on feeling a high from it. They feel great. Their brain feels good in terms of memory, concentration, motivation, all of those things. But they're not hypomanic anymore."
No," But if they still can't sleep even with supplements, over the counter supplements, then I'm probably going to go with prescription, sleeping medicines, as a temporary stopgap to try to get them three to seven days of decent sleep. That usually breaks the hypomanic cycle. And then they stay on the ketogenic diet"
No," because it's an antidepressant. And they're already hypomanic. And I certainly don't want to push that further. So as long as it's somebody without a history of addiction, I'm going to use a benzodiazepine or either commonly called the Z medicines for sleep zolpidem or Ambien or something like that."
No," I let them know that up front. We're looking for three to seven days of decent sleep. And then we're going to try to get them off that medicine. And usually, people are off to the races and can sustain it well. ANDREW HUBERMAN: A question about hormones. Many of the Huberman Lab podcast listeners will ask"
Environment," any time we're talking about something like exercise or a drug treatment or behavioral training, people will say, what about the menstrual cycle? How is that impacted by this? How does the menstrual cycle impact its efficacy, et cetera? Carbohydrates and caloric restriction have been implicated in different interactions"
No," are known to interact with the endocrine system. So what do you do if you have a patient who is depressed or could have psychotic symptoms but let's go with depression because that's probably a bit more familiar to most people and then they're on a low carbohydrate or full ketogenic diet, but their menstrual cycles cease."
No," How do you deal with those adjustments? And I guess we could expand this conversation and say, what about male fertility also? Because some caloric diets seem to my understanding is that submaintenance caloric diets, so weight loss diets, will improve testosteroneestrogen ratios in males that are obese."
No," But for someone that's not obese, to go on a subcaloric diet, that it can start to impair testosterone levels and probably not render them infertile but certainly adjust that whole axis. So what about interactions between ketosis, diets, et cetera, and the endocrine system?"
No," CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is, I don't think anybody knows. And there's not a onesizefitsall answer because I've seen examples. And I'm aware of science to back up polar opposite conclusions. So the first general observation that I'll make I know so many couples, husbands and wives,"
No," boyfriends and girlfriends, heterosexual couples, who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together ANDREW HUBERMAN: And end up with a baby? No, I'm just kidding. [LAUGHS] CHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, the men have a much easier time with it"
No," than the women. It's not across the board. But I know so many examples where the women say I couldn't tolerate that diet. It did not make me feel better. It actually made me feel worse. And I think in those cases, it probably"
No," does relate to hormones. I'm aware of animal models, of mice in particular, ketogenic diet in mouse models. One researcher shared with me, the thing that was striking is that the female mice never got pregnant on the ketogenic diet. Whereas, the mice on the standard diet"
No," were just having babies right and left. And it was just shocking, the difference. On the surface, it makes sense. The ketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state. Women who are trying to reproduce should not be fasting. If your body is in a fasting state,"
No," it probably does not want to expend resources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, and other things, to creating a baby because your very life is being threatened by, quote unquote, ""fasting"" or starvation. That even though the ketogenic diet is a sustainable, nonstarvation diet,"
No," we're really using that diet to trick the body into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state. And so just from a kind of evolutionary stance, it makes sense that women's bodies may actually have significant changes in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy because a woman should not"
No," be having a baby when she's starving to death. I know of examples of women who are the opposite, though, who have benefited dramatically and tremendously from the ketogenic diet, have put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder into full remission. And I do actually know of one case, at least one case. A woman, infertile, she and her husband"
No," had been trying for three years, no pregnancy. She went keto. Within four months, she was pregnant. How do I make sense of that? I don't know. And unfortunately, I don't think we really have good control data on what does the ketogenic diet do"
No," to male hormonal systems, what does the ketogenic diet do to female hormonal systems. But clearly, I think changes are happening. I don't have a way to predict it, at least. If somebody else has great insights, I welcome them. But I haven't seen them published. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a terrific answer"
No," announcement that because of these bidirectional effects that you described, please don't use fasting or the ketogenic diet as a reliable form of contraception. CHRIS PALMER: [LAUGHS] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please don't. I have a final question, which relates"
No, to something that is very much starting to get buzz now and maybe more so for people that hang out in the Twitter space or the nutrition space. But there's a new class of drugs that I think initially were developed to treat diabetes but are now being evaluated for their efficacy to treat obesity.
No," And these are the semaglutide drugs that are involved in they tap into these glucagon related GLP1 pathways. And it is a story that we've talked about a little bit on the podcast before. But many people, I imagine, probably haven't heard that conversation. I would simply like to know what you think about these drugs."
Environment," They obviously adjust the way that glucose and insulin are managing energy, both in the body and the brain, and can produce weight loss. So that to me, when I look at the data, it's impressive. But a good logical shift in diet and exercise could achieve similar weight loss. But a lot of people just won't do that."
No," fall right in with the catalog of other approaches that you have available. CHRIS PALMER: The real answer is, I am not at all an expert on these medications. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But what are your thoughts about them? They seem to be weight loss drugs, not unlike the fenphen drugs of the '90s that"
No," ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mother's little helper. CHRIS PALMER: was, yes, was the treatment of choice for women across the United States to keep their slim figures. And we created addicts and all sorts of problems. But they were widely used and probably millions of women because they work."
No," I see obesity as a symptom of metabolic derangement in the body or brain. And that is why people become obese. And that if we're really going to get anywhere, we need to identify what is causing that metabolic derangement. Using a symptomatic treatment like a GLP1 medication,"
No," to the best of my knowledge, is not addressing that core problem. And we're just ignoring it. Maybe I'll be wrong. And maybe these will be the wonder drug that saved the human species, and everybody will be thin and healthy forever and ever."
No," I'm not hopeful, because we've never we've had so many promising drugs come along. FenPhen, Dexedrine, and other things, we've had so many promising drugs. And at the end of the day, when you try to muck with human metabolism using a single processed molecule, manmade,"
Environment," I would much rather see people with type 2 diabetes control their diabetes through diet and lifestyle. And that might be a ketogenic diet, or a low carb diet, or exercise or good sleep, or all of the other thing. All of it. I'd much rather see that because when people try to control their type 2 diabetes with a molecule,"
No," Again, I'm not a clinician. But I've been around this space long enough to know that indeed there there are no wonder drugs. There are drugs that certainly can help alleviate symptoms in some individuals. But that lifestyle and in the case of your work in particular, in the discussion today"
No," diet and, the ketogenic diet, in particular, it's clear, can have incredible effects, miraculous effects, in some individuals. And positive effects in others that might not be of the same magnitude but nonetheless are extremely important, so on behalf of myself, and the listeners, and and certainly,"
No," just on behalf of everybody out there because everyone does need to be concerned about mental health issues, whether or not they have them and in their family themselves. Or otherwise, because they impact everybody. Just really want to thank you for viewing the work that you're doing because it really is pioneering. And it's brave."
No," CHRIS PALMER: Thank you, Andrew, for being brave and having me on your [LAUGHS] show ANDREW HUBERMAN: And a pleasure. CHRIS PALMER: and for a great conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank you for joining me for my discussion with Dr. Chris Palmer. I hope you found it to be as informative, actionable,"
No," and exciting in terms of the various treatments that we can now think about when considering treatments for psychiatric disorders.

No," What can you make your family for dinner that's healthy and tastes good? You can follow the plate method! This healthy eating plan works for everybody, including people with diabetes. Indeed, making nutritious healthy meals will be a snap."
No," What's a healthy plate? It's a way to control your serving sizes where you don't have to count. Simply use a 7inch plate for children and a 9inch plate for adults. First, divide the plate in half and fill one of them with vegetables. There are two types of"

No," Hey guys it 's danny , and today i am sharing my top 15 clean and delicious tips for anybody who is beginning to eat better or wanting to work more healthy habits into their diet or into their lifestyle . For me , when i first began to stop dieting and really commit to eating"
No," not about jumping on a fad diet or onto the next health craze . It 'S really about making a longterm commitment to a lifestyle shift for yourself . This way , you are not feeling , like you , are victim to mood , swings and cravings that come with eating a lot of highly processed"
No," everything at once and everything . At the same time , you do n't need to have all your food perfectly meal prepped , and you do n't need to stop eating all of your favorites . This is going to be a process of learning how to do things a new way and that 's going to take a little bit of"
No," time . So if you notice your brain wanting to go to that all or nothing style of thinking , just recognize that that is diet , mentality and that it does n't work . What you want to do is give yourself a little bit of permission to slow down , create some space and learn ."
No," and you will also notice that your lifestyle will affect the type of healthy diet , you 're eating . So , for example , a young student versus a working mom of two with a family versus a young professional right . All of these people can eat healthy"
No," diets and you will see that their plates look very different , based on the style of their day and the style of their life right . So there 's no hard fast rule here other than that simple tiein , that we are eating real whole unprocessed foods as close to their natural state as"
No, with and here 's the deal that does n't mean that you have to cook every single thing you eat just try to get into the habit of cooking more than you do n't and technically my friends . That is only 51 of the time . Number four focus on quality over calories . Now i have noticed for
No," things that it can add into the diet and all of a sudden food becomes a whole new playground and it 's fun and it 's creative again , and so not only does it feel good , but it Tastes good number , five . What grows together goes together when you buy foods that are in"
No," are eaten in the season they grow in , they both have better Flavor and a higher nutritional value , so it really truly is a winwin to eat . With the seasons . Number six have some back pocket recipes when you are transitioning into healthy"
No," have a keeper , you can add it in to your back pocket . This way , when you feel like you , do n't have any time to think you can always lean on this list to help you stay aligned with your goals . Number seven learn to read your labels . Learning how to read your labels is a"
No," buds with this concentration of fat , sugar , salt . And so we ca n't appreciate the natural , flavor and subtleties of real whole foods . And i do think that this is why healthy eating gets a bad wrap . So if you find that you do eat a lot of highly processed foods , what you"
No," want to start to do is baby step your way out of that , so you can start to appreciate real whole subtle flavors again and of course , you want to work on learning . How to infuse lots of flavor into your foods with herbs and spices and by watching lots of clean and"
No," have to have a instagram or pinterest ready , fridge right . I know that 's what a lot of people think when we think about meal prepping , but i do think it 's a good idea to get in the habit of learning how to cook once and then eat two three four times , because"
No," follow your hunger , so many people are in the habit of eating according to a clock or according to a diet plan or according to what the experts tell Them that we become very out of touch with our natural builtin biological signs that tell us when we are hungry , because , yes"
Environment," where we 're eating , who we are eating with all of these components , can create a healthy or unhealthy eating environment . So , for example , imagine that you 're wanting to eat healthier and you 're like i have to do this . I know i really should do this , so i 'm gon na go"
Environment," i want you to notice that , while you may be avoiding those toxins on your plate , you are still creating toxins in the body as a result of your toxic thinking .

No," and you 're with your family , who you love very much and your mom , is making one of your favorites from childhood . It 'S her lasagna and it 's got lots of white flour and lots of cheese and lots of meat and when your mom cooks it , she makes it with so much love and when you eat it , you"

No," The Ratana cafe podcast episode , 39 , a guide to funeral planning , retired or thinking about retirement . You'Ve come to the right place . Welcome to the retirement cafe podcast . In each episode , we bring you an important conversation with insight , tips"
No," about yourself and your background ? Certainly I 'm Simon Phillip , Robert head , the boys in our family always have three names . The girls only ever have two . I do n't know why . But then we had n't had a girl in our family for five generations over a little bit boy heavy . I suppose my"
No," grandfather George , had began in 1926 in Bournemouth . The family had been here for three generations before that , so grandad looked after the business and then he passed it on to my father , Phillip , who joined it after his service in World War . Two in the Navy he came back and , and now"
No," it 's my turn to look after it now , and we now have two of our sons . We have two sons , both in their midtwenties James and Roberts , who are with us fulltime my wife , Katherine works in the business we 've been at the Lansdowne premises since 1926 , we 're a small family business"
No," with traditional values . But these days you have to have a bit of a modern twist . If that 's what your customers after right tell me what bit all about the modern twist then well , I suppose in the old days it used to be always somebody died more or less at"
No," home or in hospital , and the service would be a service in church , followed By a burial almost always and in chromatin , started coming in in the thirties and forties more overly after the Second World , War , cremation was a more accepted form of ."
No," um one of the things I 'm not sure . I would know what , if someone you know , I was just mentioning before , but pala mines mum has just died . You know he 's kind of out of the area . He 'S got to travel back home he 's got to sort that out . She was on her own ."
No," Where does he start well , it seemed he 'd been contacted by the person who was responsible for letting the family member know . The first question you need to ask yourself is : where actually has the person died ? Does the body actually need to be moved so if , for example , the"
No," lady has died in hospital , then there 's no pressure immediately on him to make further arrangements . The paperwork needs to be sorted out in the hospital administrators will do that . If she 's died in the community , then the body will need to be moved to a funeral directors"
No," you and in this case mum , can have the funeral arrangements that you 've possibly thought about . Yes , and that 's the thing at what point you start thinking about your funeral arrangements , the more modern thinking is sooner rather than later , but you do n't have to"
No," person that 's died . Is there a little bit of guilt in there somewhere mmm ? Do you ? Are you going to make practical decisions , or are you going to make emotional decisions planning ? Something is important , but it ought n't really to be in the forefront of your"
No," mind all the time . So if you do get a thought write it down , put it in a piece of paint on a piece of paper somewhere separately and then revisit that if you get another thought my wife Catherine 's up to about three days of music at the moment . Well"
No," , that 's nice ! I wo n't have that at my funeral . What I mean we 've got three days of music , so she 's gon na have to presumably give as a slide exact you might get . Family rates depends how she behaves and , of course , if she 's still the current mrs head , when she passes , of"
No," course , there 'll be , do anything into that say we talk about unusual requests . What could you give me an example of something not normalized ? Yes , what is unusual to you might not be unusual to me or to the people that come to us . Family backgrounds are important and"
No," they ca n't burn effectively right . So there are smoking missions , issues with that , so your limitation is slightly more with cremation than it is with burial mmhmm , and if the coffin is too big , you ca n't get it in the chromate ER and you have to bury it if it 's too big to go In"
No," Do you think I should get a you know , an insurance plan , this one was from the coop and I 'm sure there are other ones available . Is that a good idea - and I must admit I said so - I see you have any illness . I have no idea , I think , from what you 've just told me : you have significant"
No," before I came into the family business . I did three years with Barclays bank , which was a great experience for me in terms of how a bank account etc . But yes , if you have a funeral account , it can be presented to the bank , who would be quite pleased to pay it ."
No," obviously if funds are in something less tangible , then it we have to wait for probate or the family or the inn would pay for it out of other funds , and if you found the insurance , I suppose you you you . You noted that you 're not in the business of purchasing the insurance . I"
No," suppose you may be in the position of dealing with the insurance companies if , if the events of someone presenting an insurance plan to you , yes , I mean there are two ways with this : you 've got a life insurance policy which pays on death and you and then That sum of money is paid"
No," into the estate that can be used for all sorts of things now going on slightly as a tangent from that with a prepayment funeral plan yeah . Basically , it is an insurance policy , but it 's with a funeral tagon , and that has implications as to who actually is the plan provider . But"
No," who is the provider of the funeral service and the two sometimes marry up right ? In many cases they do n't because the insurance policy is a national policy . And again , it 's like I said in earlier on is no onesizefitsall we 're all individuals , but because it 's a"
No," mind to do an insurance policy , it might be better to do it without any tag ons that they might not like it 's better to have your choice of funeral director . I would have thought if you 're going to actually give them instructions on how to proceed on their behalf , when they 're"
No, know they do n't actually mean that they actually mean something not completely different but slightly different yeah and it 's knowing the family background that can often Help you in that situation sure sure now I 've come across natural burial of few times
No," , you know that 's been fascinating , listening to their talk assignment , what are the ? What are the kind of key messages that you 'd , like our listeners , to take away when thinking about this subject listening over there well morning , call plays well yes all morning"
No," that you like write it down , and This can be ongoing . Your list is probably to be quite long . Mmm , not everybody goes to church these days . We do n't have so many hymns , but you might have three or four hymns that you think so write it down . If you want to formalize it in"
No," appreciate the time for coming to chat to me today and this morning you know you 're always very engaging when when what can be quite a dry , delicate topic , so thank you for so much coming in having a chat just popped into my mind . There was a lovely lady whose husband"
No," was rather on the lazy side and when he died , this is a long time ago , and this is n't a gag . This is actually true and the lady stalls still with us . She put her husband 's ashes in an hourglass and she turns him three times a day , because it 's the most active he 's"
No," topics , we 've discussed on the podcast , please search the retirement cafe page on Facebook and follow our page and if you 've enjoyed this conversation , please please leave a review on iTunes or share with your friends and family . You may think you also may enjoy the podcast"
No," to me last night for me to vet are about the meatiest and the deepest And the most thoughtprovoking - and i just hope i have answers for them . Thank you . I i approached this . As you know , i 've been i 've been reading your work for about 10 years , and i just"
No," with the energy and dedication to continue pushing this ball forward ? Despite intense pushback from multitrillion dollar industries that are threatened by what you have to say , um , those are , you know , shall we say uh"
No," life . Satisfaction by seeing a kid do better because of you know my work and , and you know because of my my advice , um , it 's one of the things that drives me is you know that life satisfaction that doing a good job for a child does"
No," what i realized Growing up is that children are rarely perpetrators , but they are frequently victims and what i saw when the obesity epidemic came around was that children were being uh portrayed as perpetrators ."
No," uh so trying to do right by children has always sort of been my . You know my north star uh in terms of the iconoclast in terms of the you know , wanting to get it right , making sure that"
Environment, the people who got it wrong get their just desserts as it were . I you know i i when you asked me the question . You know last night i i sort of recalled a very specific episode in my own medical school training that i think sort of set
No," work , and so i 've got . You know . I'Ve got this stuff in my background that says , you know , do right by children and do n't let anybody you know um steer you wrong wow . Thank you . Thank you for sharing all that and that that memory that you shared um"
Environment," brings to mind one . That is , in my mind , sort of an indelible memory from my uh surgical training , where i was on my sinus rotation and i brought in a stack of papers about the relationship between certain foods and risk of chronic rhinocerositis"
No," of everyone ? You know thinking . Why are we talking about this ? We do n't counsel people on nutrition , we 're not nutritionists with someone that it was something that someone said um it 's burned into my mind , and it motivates me almost every day ."
No," be and um kind of circling to covet . So it 's i would say it 's been fairly disappointing to see that during like even covid this , the magnitude of this pandemic could not get us as a country on a"
No," from the smoking playbook , which was a bit more of a subtle evolution towards significant progress about what might happen with metabolic health , and i think the the last part of this question is : do you think that we will"
No," provide you know uh , shall we say contrarian views which maybe i 'm one of them . Since i present a contrarian view about diet , you know to what the uh the uh the cognizant they think . So you know the goal . You know the goal of"
No," know what happened to them . So this question about diet . You know it 's one of the ideas that must die amazing . Well , i certainly am looking forward to the day when the idea that there is still a tenuous link between sugar and"
No," You know a drug for every ill that we see today and i think when you start - and this happens , it has to happen independently in medical school . You have to figure out , you have to step back and think and when you realize that the"
No," terms of the medical system , shifting its thinking towards treating the subcellular pathologies that lead to disease and not the downstream symptoms , how is this going to work its way into medical school um ? How are we going to start treating that way , because it 's"
No," research , to figure out how to clinically monitor these things , but since we 're not thinking this way , it 's tough case casey , you have just summed up what 's wrong with modern medicine in you know , In a question so uh and - and i will be very honestly - i do n't"
No," because um , at least in my personal experience - and i i think just from reading your book . You know yours too , it 's like once . You start thinking about these things once you 're exposed to them . You know it 's really hard to go back . Uh yeah , it 's"
No," and empowering future We 'D like to see around food and individual diet , because at the end of the day , the system has to change , but it also there is an element of personal choice and personal accountability that comes into this . Where , like we really just when we choose"
No," try organic matter organic matter that can be turned into energy . Ah , okay turned into energy , not quite that 's like half the definition , but you you 're you 're you 're"
No," to either the growth or burning of an organism . So all of those who said fuel all those who said energy , you got the burning part , but you missed the growth part"
No," substance reduces consumption which reduces health harms so that it 's true for tobacco . It 'S true for alcohol , it 's true for opioids ! It 'S true for sugar Okay , so if you 're trying to get to reduction"
No, by death that perhaps could have been avoided by what we 're all trying to achieve ? I think we all take a step in the right direction by either changing our family around us or ourselves . So i 'd like to point out that maybe one death at a time
No," community that we have somehow keeps getting crushed by this fda big food , big ag , despite our numbers and it 's Either money or or like you said , you know , a generation has to pass in front of us . So where do we see these ? How do we unravel these entities"
No," that are in such control of this thing ? Yeah ? Well , i you know again , if i , if i knew that we 'd already be doing it and it 's it 's pretty tough um , there 's a lot of glad handing here , as i think you know , you know , both fda and usda are called um ."
No," at the trump administration , that 's exactly what happened . So you know , unfortunately , we have to dissociate those . You know it 's the same thing that happened to church and state in all these countries in eastern europe ."
No," right . You have metabolic syndrome and gout and kidney stones . You need a low , refined , carbohydrate sugar , low , purine , low oxalate diet right . Okay , so let 's say you want kitchen chicken cacciatore for dinner"
No, lowest In oxalate then goes to your supermarket and looks at all the skus in the supermarket for the ingredients that meet your biochemical criteria . Orders those delivers them to your house and charges your insurance company for
No," drunk driving . That 'S what happened with you know : bicycle helmets and seat belts . That 'S what happened with smoking in public places ! That 'S what happened with condoms and bathrooms right 30 years ago , if a"
No," That 'S how you affect societal change . You teach the children so we 're going to teach the children . Thank you on that note , scott and everyone . We do have an episode , we 're recording with kelly levesque in actually next week for"
No," with convenience and natalie has a question around people who have profile so sweet green ceo came out publicly and had had some thoughts on the pandemic , but um thinking about where convenience lies uh . In addition to people who have profile and"
Environment," , transport and so high insulin causes water retention . So you have to increase ace2 's and so high insulin . Ie metabolic disease ultra process , food consumption inc increases how fast covid will spread throughout your body"
No," Uh , let me find it . He said 78 of hospitalizations due to covid are obese and overweight people . Is there an underlying problem that perhaps we have not given enough attention to now ? That 'S true"
No," , okay and you know josh and sam and casey and everybody else - you know they 've heard what i 've had to say on this issue . Glucose is just the start . It 'S what we can measure now : okay , yeah , fine ! Fine ! I 'M glad ! I 'M glad levels is doing it and you 're doing a"
No," channels you know for those Analytes on board and i 'm sort of thinking you know if glucose is only 10 , you know like . Maybe we need that insulin , you know first , and so you know i 'm working with some uh other people to you"
No," community , which i think is so important , because i 'm sure many of us feel like we 're like the odd man out . So often i do n't talk about this stuff with a lot of people , even though i 'm really interested in it and"
No," like casey mentioned earlier . I'Ve been so disappointed by covid , because in my naivete i actually thought like this could be a turning point for metabolic health and talking about these things and being open about . Why we 're so at risk and what we can do about it . And"
No," you know what we can do within our own communities to To take a short list of things that do n't feel so overwhelming to people and have a lot of scientific , you know backing and right and try to help at least move things forward in whatever way we can as"
No," healthy . They will live a completely normal life diet , a completely normal age , not cost the taxpayer a dime they 're just fat . They even have normal length telomeres the edges of the chromosomes that determine you know when"
Environment," , well , the genie foundation at uc berkeley actually did this exercise several years ago . First , authors , alston and what they realized was the price . Only two things in the grocery store will go up . Two"
No," i know in my immediate world are um . They are n't obese , but they experience hyperinsulin anemia sure my best friend has told me how metabolically healthy is because he 's wearing levels and he 'll crush bowls of lucky charms and he said"
No," something you alluded to it 's great to have all this insight and all these takeaways as we start to think about ways that we can spread . This information and spread everything that you 've addressed in the book with one friend with one person , and that"
No," draw on at this time do not narrowly imply that our ailment is merely a freakish and pitiable possibility . If we can appeal to images that tease out the universal and dignified themes of our state , so that we do not , on top of everything , else , have to fear and hate"
No," we Could ever be perfect and would instead welcome our griefs and our errors , our stumbles and our follies as no less a part of us than our triumphs and our intelligence . It is japan 's zen buddhism that has historically perhaps best put forward"
No," such notions with its bold declaration that life itself is suffering and its veneration in the visual arts and , by extension , in its psychology of what is imperfect and unglossy rainy autumn evenings sadness . Moss covered roofs"
No," , we can recognize that whatever the particularities of our crisis , which will naturally need to be investigated in due course , Our pains fit into a broad picture of a crisisprone human condition . No one is spared"
No, parents . Our desires will always exceed reality . We will all make some appalling errors . We will hurt those we love and anger those with power over us . We will be anxious and confused woeful and lost . We should accept both that we are profoundly unwell
No," , and yet these marks can be worn with pride and selfrespect . According to zen buddhism 's tradition of kintsugi , an accidentally smashed bowl is n't going to be thrown away in embarrassment its pieces . Can be carefully collected and reassembled with"
No," we can confront our illness without panic or fear with a quiet , intelligent sadness , perhaps best captured by the word melancholy . If we were searching for a patron saint of such a melancholy relationship to mental difficulty"
No," People asked me Brendan : how do i reprogram my mind and I 'm like that 's kind of creepy or you 're cyborg ? Well , why did somebody one time like ninjitsu , your brain and hypnotizing and thinking something horrible like ? Why did n't you reprogram anything ? Most adults , do n't"
No," : hey , dude , we 've thought through this before or hey dude we 're trying to protect you . So it 's running at a very baseline , easy , energetic level your brain loves to optimize itself . It does n't like to have to do a whole lot of thinking . It just likes to say what do we already"
No," know ? How can we apply it to the situation ? So if you had fears in the past and similar situations here , your body just generates those fears and says : hey man run away again . If you had the challenges in the past"
No," stands for relative weight of importance and duration . People often who have negative recurring thoughts and feelings in their life . The reason those keep coming up all the time is because they they at some point in their life or continually , are giving those thoughts"
No," , the negative ones more attention than necessarily any other thoughts . In other words , the relative weight that they give those thoughts is quite high and they give a lot of importance in it . Ilysm . Those thoughts are very important to me right now , and their their duration only"
No," lasts over a period of time . They keep thinking about those thoughts , thinking about those think about those thoughts , and it 's all that repetition that seals it in the back of their head and now their head says . Oh , this is an easy thing . I know this one and it pulls"
No," life . We can give positive thinking , positive questions , positive approaches to life , a lot of importance in our life and a lot of focus and focus on them and give a lot of duration to them over a period of time . And they get sealed in the brain as well . And now the brain says"
Environment," now , just checking it you 're in line in traffic waiting for the next car just sitting like what are my thoughts right now and just notice what you 've been thinking about ? The more did we notice what we 've been thinking about the more"
No," we can interrupt . What we 've been thinking about see if we just allow that feeling to keep coming up and you do n't pay attention to it , and our life can be very frazzled and very highly anxious . But once we say , what 's my mind on right now and we redirect it"
No," closing their eyes just visualizing , A more positive outcome , thinking about the more positive outcome , thinking about more positive outcome , thinking about the more positive outcome focusing on with their eyes closed and that visualization of a more positive outcome of how things"
No," come up with this . I 'M thinking about a new dream , a new goal . I 'M gon na go interview . Some you know major celebrity or we got a bigtime , celebrity client and I get a little nervous and I can start thinking about all these negative things that could happen if I screw up"
No," my mind immediately , interrupts that now , because my mind goes relative weight of importance And duration Brendon , you can either give this thought more time and energy and focus or you can just stop it and force your brain creatively force it to direct it to a different possible"
Environment," into positive orientations . To make healthier decisions to enact healthier . Behaviors , if you can just focus on getting more attentive to what you 're feeling and then do these thought exercises what questions who do I want to be , and you do that over and over"
No," again everything changes last thought our unconscious and our mind is incredibly programmed . Not just by thought , which is what I 've been talking about : relative weight of importance and duration , focusing our attention on you know what"
No, just react to bad situations like this cuz . That 'S how we 've done it . You can actually conditioned your mind without doing any thought other than just behaving in a more positive manner and solely you find yourself thinking more positively . I know it sounds duplicitous
No," your mind so be a person of good positive thinking , be a person of good positive action and suddenly one day you will wake up and you 're like I do n't . I just feel amazing . I feel extraordinary . I feel positive and that 's what it feels like to live the charge life"
Environment," This powerpoint presentation is part one of the introduction to communication in health and social care , adults and children and young people early years and child care . It 'S part of the level one certificate"
Environment," introduction to health , social care and children and young people 's settings , and also the level 2 dementia awareness run by plato , training . The aims and objectives of this session are to understand the factors that influence"
No," To understand how memory impairment may affect the ability of an individual with dementia , to use verbal language and to know different methods of communication and understand how to communicate with individuals ? You will be using your workbook to"
No," , which is speaking and listening , nonverbal communication , so ways to communicate without speaking informal communication , speaking with friends for more communication . So this is when information"
No," we 're communicating with younger people younger children , small children , you know you 'll communicate in a manner that they will understand as opposed to um . If we 're talking to professionals"
No," Taking turns making sure that you do give give people time to to speak , to communicate with you . You know if you 're working with um well young children , adults with additional needs"
Environment," and you 'll , see here the purpose of communication in health and social care and early year settings so to negotiate and liaise with service users , their family Members with colleagues and a range of professionals to exchange"
Environment," that method of communication make some notes on the research it 's good to know for a career in health and social care , and you could also look at the youtube videos . And you know , if you like learning visually , you could"
No," So this is when information is given through signs and symbols and you 'll see on this slide . There 'S a few different signs and symbols there . For some examples . You'Ve got the um the stop the um . You know , children , um crossing you 've got"
Environment," um little cult pegs there . On that picture there so um , you know like if he was in a nursery or a school environment , the children would know where to hang their coats and they 've got pictures on there as"
No," well . So um , you know the symbol , so um a child might know that they 've got a rainbow on their coat peg . So it 's a visual image for them to um that sign for them to go and put their coat on there . You can see the tap with their with"
No," included in inside a communication passport . These are used when someone is either nonverbal or if they have a disability or a learning disability , and actually ca n't tell you for themselves so we 'll talk you through the"
No," probably have 17 pages and you 'll see there . You know there 's and key things you need to know special people , their family , their friends , how they communicate , etc . So just have a look at those and we 're going to talk you through each"
No," mother , the father , the wife , husband or partner son daughter , brother sister - do they have any pets you know so this would this would be different for each individual , so each person 's communication passport"
No," would be different or similar , so this talks about their family . So you know like the example , so my partner , my wife , my husband , is what their name is . We have um so many children , their names"
No," , their ages where they live , and you know if you 've got grandchildren again we have grandchildren how many grandchildren , what their names are . The ages , this page is for friends , so write down . Um"
No," they 'll have the friends who their friends are , what their friends are called and again you know all this information is for you there to communicate . So you can talk about the friends , you know the friends names and you can"
No," the family . Sport work tv , the programs they like on the television what their hobbies are . Do they like gardening music ? Do they go to church ? Do you like watching the news what food they like and you know what"
No," you can talk about the drinks you know ? Have they been on holidays ? All these things are important , so you can communicate with that person . So this page is about places so where they live . Um the family , where the family live"
Environment," look at um . The different needs different communication needs , so you know communication . It varies from person to person when you 're working in a care environment . You need to ensure you"
Environment," communicate to me . Each person 's individual needs it 's very important in health and social care and early years care , and so we need to take time to find out how best to communicate with someone"
No," know what time would you like lunch um observe the individual watch watch the the child communicate with friends , see how their language skills are developing . So by observing them you can pick up the way , the best way for you to"
No," communicate with them , because you 'll find out by observing back through observation , ask other people who have them . They may have useful information . So you know if you 're working with children , young adults"
No," , the parents or family members how best to communicate with the person close to them . So just by asking questions about how best to communicate with someone will help to support good communication . But sometimes you need to ask the"
No," parents , the families or other support services for help . Healthcare workers will often look at a person 's records or care plan and see if there are any . If there 's any information about the best way to communicate with that person"
No," and when you 're working in care , you could be working with people of all ages so from babies to older adults or people with learning disabilities . So it 's really important to communicate in an appropriate way . So that good communication takes place"
No," , and then they begin babbling and gurgling and that 's their way of communicating with you so communication with children . So you know it 's important that you develop a trust in relationship ."
No," You um . You know we talked before about active listening , so active listening skills using signs , pictures , translators and interpreters , a good understanding of nonverbal communication when we 're communicating with children"
No," and it 's important , asking openended questions , questions that will lead to a conversation instead of just yes and no answers . So asking a child about so they may have been for a trip to the zoo . You know in saying , did you go to the zoo ?"
No," You could say ? Oh , what did you see at the zoo ? Tell me about your day . Tell me about the zoo . You know , and so that 's important when you 're communicating with children and communication with young adults , so"
No," brings you to question number two and you need to give three ways to communicate with babies , three ways to communicate with children and three ways to communicate with young adults . You need to write in sentences and um . You know about each example to"
No," demonstrate your understanding and you 'll see you know in the in the lefthand side , you need to write the way to communicate , and then you need to write a sentence to explain what it means when communicating with the babies with the children And"
No," um and in observing an individual while you communicate with them , can give you Visual clues as well about their interests and their understanding . Speaking to the family and friends again we mentioned this earlier , but you know family and friends . They"
No," know those people best better than anyone . So it 's important , you know that you speak to them and you ask them the best way to communicate so reading um somebody 's care plan , so an individual 's care plan should describe"
No," know we 'll look at the first one , so children , older adults or wheelchair users who may be lower down than others . So that 's a barrier to communication and ways to overcome . So make sure you get down to the same level as others , so"
No," that you can make good eye contact and allow the child or person to feel included . Now , on the next one , we 've got the missing box to the barrier , so you 've got to think about what that barrier could be . The way to overcome that barrier is to"
No," is where the social factors um may happen . So the individual may feel unsafe , they may feel fearful or could generally be unhappy . They could be experienced , abuse or neglect and um staff and family using inappropriate"
No," , because They'Ve got their own dementia or mental health issues , and these are the social factors that that may influence this . So question number seven is asking you to identify at least four factors , so no less , but at"
No," To understand how memory impairment may affect the ability of an individual with dementia to use verbal language , know different methods of communication and understand how communicate how to communicate with individuals."

No, grandparent and i help longdistance grandparents stay connected to their grandchildren . But as part of that you know we often deal . I run a membership program for grandparents and what comes up
No," presentation and what a privilege to have you participate in the conversation today , thank you thanks , casey yeah , my name 's , john and um . I 'M just wondering how do you get new older friends when all your friends are"
No," on any of these sites , where you can try to get some kind Of new relationship with older people , so how do you ? How do you do that ? In fact , this two of mine just died two days ago and i do n't go to any of the funeral homes or anything . I have n't even been any of my family 's"
No," weddings or funerals because of my health condition and my uh . You know my doctor said you know you got to be careful very careful . So how do you make ? How do you get new friends ? In fact , one of them called me um last thursday , and i"
No," i saw it on the um , the caller id . I was busy and then get call me back and i went to call him back yesterday and i see his obituary in the in the paper . So i mean uh , you know , try to get new friends somewhere when you do n't go out"
No," there are nine people in our presentation now , including myself , um and two of our friends are joining us on the phone today . Here we go"
No, research shows that oxytocin is shown to decrease our stress and anxiety levels when it 's released in certain parts of the brain . So i want to talk about that stress hormone
No," , which helps to cancel out and decrease that cortisol in our system , decreasing our stress and anxiety levels . So there 's a relationship there , cortisol levels just happen throughout the day , oxytocin through our positive relationships , help to bring it down ."
No," a theory in a moment , uh showing that that will actually bring the oxytocin for us as well selfcare together , either as a family or as a friend unit . Whatever the relationship is , do that that selfcare together those things that uh make you"
No," and the things that we enjoy doing and bring those to The surface spend time with those things a couple . Other tips are to celebrate the strengths , your individual strengths , the other person 's individual strengths and the strengths that you have together in"
No," a relationship and if there are weaknesses present , which there always are we 're only human work on them together independently . However , that may look , but celebrating those strengths and"
No," , and that is the positive relationship hormone . Just strengthening your bond together , so i want to present a theory from salvador , mnuchin and salvador . Mnuchin was a family"
No," therapist born and raised in argentina . He developed structural family theory which addresses problems within a family by charting the relationships between family members , and he describes family relationships as a"
No," two people we 'll keep it simple . So to illustrate this person a will say it 's it 's i 'll use myself and my partner as an example . So let 's say um , my husband is person a"
No," right . So i 'm feeling a little defensive at this point . Thinking , oh he 's mad at me , and so i might be like it 's fine in that same kind of you know , standoffish tone and because i reacted that way"
No," , what comes to mind : you 're , welcome , to put it in the chat or unmute and say it to the group when i say friendship what comes to mind casey , i was Thinking about"
No, you know in my 40s make new friends and what comes to mind for me . It 'S like when i feel that i can kind of you know when i have people around me where like if something goes wrong
No," uh connection to like friendship is really about connecting with people sharing kind of you know . Sharing values is really one of the key things for me in a friendship . Thank you , carrie , and one of the words that you did n't explicitly state , but i 'm"
Environment," hearing you talk about is safety . Is that right , yeah ? Definitely - and you know what as we get like older , i mean it is - i i find sometimes more difficult to make friends , because you know i have some really great friends that live not"
Environment," close to me , and so maybe my standards are kind of up in terms Of you know who i would consider as a friend um , but yeah definitely safety and trust , somebody that you can trust ."
No," thoughts before we move on on what comes to mind with the word . Friendship awesome well , thank you for all of your contributions and uh carrie . Just to the the points about um you you mentioned uh , you have really good friends but they 're not near you"
No," and you know the standards for finding friends . Um , maybe is n't you know , enabling you to connect with with the people immediately around you and research shows that as we age , we actually get choosier"
No," you have people to turn to if needed . Research also suggests that particularly looking at women , the more friends that women had the less likely they were to develop physical problems as they aged"
No," the results were so significant . The researchers concluded that not having close friends is as detrimental to our health as smoking or obesity and in another study , researchers who followed nearly 1500 older people for 10 years found that those with a large"
No," network of friends outlived those with fewer friends by more than 20 percent close relationships with family , however , had almost no effect on longevity . So that 's very interesting . The difference in the impact between friends and family um in that particular study"
No," you know it 's been a particularly tough time during the pandemic um , but what i 've also so i 've noticed that you know he has lost some of his best friends uh . He still has good people around him , his neighbors um , but certainly it 's not the same , and i do put myself in his"
No," shoes and thinking about , like you know when you lose your besties um how how hard that is , and then also that he 's also . You know the last living sibling on uh in his family and so we 're we 're from he 's from ireland and so going home"
No," convenient , if you are a parent with young children and you meet other parents with young children - hey you have playdate friends and you just hang out because that 's the thing to do at that time . Um and"
No," flint , fewer friends and less time spent with friends as we get older . There 'S also a difference captured between men 's relationships and women 's relationships , and research indicates that men 's"
No," we can be connected with people and not in proximity , as carrie mentioned , i think she 's joining us from canada today . She is not in our proximity whatsoever , um , but we are connected , and so through this lens making new friends as"
Environment," happen , whether you 're , male or female , but get involved in activities . You enjoy just to naturally put yourself in environments where other people are and if chances are , you are enjoying the thing that everyone is doing , they 're"
No," and be yourself be yourself as you do that , and this particular point i really think is important . Think about making new friends like dating . You would n't expect to marry the first person you ever dated"
No," , i mean . Sometimes it happens right and good for that , but realistically making new friends it 's hit and miss just like dating can be , and we should n't take it personally when a friendship does n't get off the ground ."
No, and just keep stepping out trying uh the things that you enjoy and meeting the people along the way and see what sticks and the belief
No," that you can make friends at any age is important . I 'M sure you 've all heard the idea that we are what we eat . We are also what we believe , and so really"
No," , if i internalize the message , that 's while i 'm too old to make friends um - or i ca n't make friends because fill in the blank um that will inherently make it more difficult for me um . Just simply because my brain believes"
No," So it 's very important for us to believe that we can make friends at any age and just you know , keep trying and trying again to see what sticks . So i want to ask the group now : these are a couple tips um"
No," and i uh the citations are , of course , at the bottom of the slides , um we 're running low on time , but um . I want to ask the group : what are your tips for making new friends ? Is there"
No, anything that has worked really well for you or that um ? You know you would add to this list this terry yeah . I was just thinking about
No," intergenerational friendships and how kind of being open to um yeah , making friends with people who are younger and older , and so i 'm an i 'm actually an older mom"
No," pandemic about intergenerational friendships and the power , because we lived in this culdesac and there were um . There was a young family who had you know really . Young children and"
No," neighbors are in their early 80s and we were out for drinks with them the other night . So i do n't know , i think it 's just about being open . I think sometimes , when we think about making friends it 's somebody who is similar to us in age as an"
No," example , but i 've learned so much from uh from always having friends who are older and younger than me . So i think that 's . I think it 's a good tip . Yes , thank you so much carrie for naming that one of"
No," the relationships that i developed during the pandemic too . One of my best friends now is in her 70s and lives in canada . We talk every friday um . I love that . Yes , yes , we we met through a meditation group"
No," right ? Your community did n't just start showing up on the lawns and sitting there right . So when someone said hey , let 's try this right , yeah and you know what it 's one thing . I was just being kind of reflective about my own experiences and"
No," when i first moved to houston , i met this lovely um , this lovely guy who his family was in dubai and you know he was older and i was too shy , like i really enjoyed our conversation . I was there , you know in kind of whole foods cafe"
No," the uh chat here . But it 's a it 's all online , like it 's all virtual aldera elderaai , and so you can sign up and uh you 're linked with a child"
No," platform for people 50 plus and the whole express purpose is to help people 50 plus Make friends so it 's kind of a you know it 's a canadian based organization , but they have people from the states and from canada , so just as something to check out"
No, the benefits . We talked about . The the brain and body benefits of friendship - let 's talk about the brain and body benefits of grandparenting research - shows that grandparenting improves our mental and emotional health by combating stress and depression .
No," There 'S that that cortisol right being combated by the oxytocin again , it helps to instill a sense of purpose and confidence , and the innate amount of brain and memory"
Environment," exercise that occurs during a grand parenting . Interaction can protect us against declines in cognition , such as alzheimer 's disease . The positive attachment with grandparents also benefits children , the development of healthy attachment"
No," styles and social skills in younger children . Um is , you know very important for for their own personal developments , and research shows that both the grandparents and grandchildren . This study , particularly"
No, looked at adult grandchildren that positive attachment having a positive relationship reduces depressive symptoms in both both the grandparent and the adult grandchild just by having a positive relationship .
No," So i want to just uh , pose this to the group and see if anything , immediately , bubbles up um any comments on how being a grandparent has been different from parenting , your own child"
No," everything like you always hear . Oh grandchildren are awesome , you know . Sometimes they say we should have the grandchildren , you know first or something like that , but i never really knew it 's different . The relationship until you experience it and"
No," he does n't always have to be your grandchildren . It can be your nieces or nephews , or you know other children that you may bond with the second thing , i think that 's really important that i 've learned um"
No," is that you need to just let the parents , parent and you need to be the grandparent . You know um . Sometimes i see in people around me or friends or whatever and myself that you really want to give your opinion on things and that 's"
No," i 'm going to just name what each of these are and how prevalent they found . Each of them to be . In the grandparents that they were doing the study with so remote grandparents rarely see their children , usually they live far away , but may also have a distant relationship ."
No," does things with the grandchild , but have little authority or control over them . They prefer to spend time with them without interfering in parenting . They are more like friends to their grandchildren and they found that 55"
No," of grandparents studied , met the companion style and finally involved involved . Grandparents take a very active role in their grandchild 's life . The children may even live with the grandparent . The involved , grandparent is"
No," one who has frequent contact with an authority over the grandchild and 15 percent of grandparents studied met the involved , grandparent style . So i 'd like to pause actually and um carrie . I would be"
No," licorice in the background . No , i put you on the spot . I 'M sorry yeah well , because i i mean i this is interesting , because this this research is um . You know in the 1980s and i think that we 're seeing certainly a shift in what grandparent grandchild"
No," mean grandparents from a distance . Now are talking to their grandchildren . You know some some grandparents , i know talk to them every day , because they 're kind of doing virtual , babysitting and reading to their grandchildren every"
No," day or they 're meeting every single weekend . You know on a sunday evening to chat with their grandchildren , so i know that um , you know and even like the companion , you know being a companion . Grandparent is different now because you have that"
No," actively , grandparenting or or has uh young children in your life , um or or older children in your life . I want to invite you to uh . You know consider these , obviously , as carrie was saying , these are not as kind of"
No," identifying with perhaps the remote style , or you know the companion or the involved style if you 're identifying with one of these is that the role you want to have with your grandchildren ."
No," or doing what you can do right still is worth it in a meaningfully connecting kind of way . Other ideas um can include if you have older grandchildren , attending a virtual class or joining a virtual club together or an inperson"
No," uh carrie 's website with just tons more ideas and i believe , a weekly newsletter for different ideas around specifically connecting with grandchildren in meaningful ways and then the last thing i 'll mention is in order for us to meaningfully Connect"
No," David is the chair for the Missouri Department of Mental Health State Advisory Council on substance use, prevention and recovery, and a coordinator for the Recovery Advocacy Project. He was named a Mental Health Champion in 2017 by the Missouri Mental Health Foundation. David's presentation will provide an overview"
Environment," and I am a person in longterm recovery. Would that mean to me is I haven't used the alcohol or other drugs since in January 31st, 2009. And because of that, today I'm able to impact my community in positive ways. One of the things that I've done is I helped to create the certified peer training"
Environment," for the state of Missouri, along with a handful of other peers, the Missouri Credentialing Board, the Department of Mental Health. And then what we were able to do is provide that and I've been able to facilitate some of those trainings. Recently though is I've looked around at other states"
No," And that's what this first definition says, right? Is that it's the breadth and depth, not just an internal, but also external resources that we can draw upon to initiate and sustain recovery from alcohol and other drug problems. And here a lot of times they say severe, I say chaotic, right?"
No," but basically natural recovery is those who have chaotic use at one point that are able to stop using alcohol and other drugs or reduce their use to moderate levels, without going into treatment, without having that rock bottom. Because honestly I hate even the word rock bottom,"
No," as the peer sees it, right? Not as we see their problem, not as clinicians or the criminal justice system sees their problems, right? It's why we actually do recovery plans with the peers that we support, instead of using treatment plans,"
No," because treatment plans tend to be a lot more clinical and they tend to look at reaching these objectives that have been set up by an insurance company, that had been set up by a judge, a probation officer for them to reach, instead of saying, ""You know what?"
No," we're gonna look at every single one of these, right? We're gonna look at personal capital, which has a couple of different rubrics that it falls under, which would be physical capital and human capital that are underneath that. We're also gonna look at family and social capital. We're gonna look at community capital, cultural capital"
No," So, with physical capital, we look at like the available resources that a person has to fulfill their basic needs, right? Like their health, healthcare, financial resources, clothing, food, shelter, residents, transportation, right? So, can they provide for their family? Do they have access to public transportation"
No," or personal transportation that's reliable? And it is when they need it. Are they able to provide for themselves, for their families? Is their neighborhood safe? Better yet is there a place of residence safe? Not only for them, but for their other family members."
Environment," Is the environment that they are typically in, free from alcohol and other drugs or people who are promoting that lifestyle if abstinence is something that they're seeking? Do they have access to clean and comfortable clothes? Do they have insurance or at least access to affordable healthcare,"
No," their values, their educational and vocational skills, credentials, problem solving, selfawareness, selfesteem, selfefficacy. How confident am I that in high stress situations, I can actually make positive choices or choices that are gonna lead me to a positive outcome. Am I optimistic?"
No," Am I hopeful, right? Because as we know, recovery actually comes out you of hope, right? Hope is what? The belief that one has both the ability and the opportunity to create a better life. So, if somebody is hopeful,"
No," here we're looking at them having that ability innately, personally, themselves in this piece of it, right? So, what's their purpose in life? Do they have recovery rituals that they engage in consistently? Are they setting and attaining goals? Do they have hope"
No," that their future will get better and better? Do they now have tools or problem solving skills that they might have lacked during times of chaos in their life to help pull them out, whenever they come into obstacles or start beating themselves up or maybe face a stigma from the community?"
No," Are they an active participant in making their family and their community a better, safer and stronger place? I always say that was kind of one of the secret sauces in my recovery personally, was knowing that I am engaged in my community and my community is a better place because I've lived there. I'm doing things actively to make my community better,"
No," whether it's through like say a stream team that picks up trash out of Missouri river ways to partnering with Springfield Public Schools, going in and painting playgrounds, maybe it's volunteering at NAMI or a dropin center, or a recovery community center to help do classes. Maybe it's going out and joining in PTA"
No," and some of those things, where you're making a difference in your community. So next, we look at family and social capital and here we look at intimate relationships. We look at a family and kinship relationships. So, we're talking about blood, right? We're talking about those nontraditional families"
No," of choice. The way I always say it is, I can't pick my family, but I couldn't pick my blood, but I can pick the people that are in my circle. I also once heard somebody say, you show me your friends I'll show you your future."
No," especially ones that are supportive of our recovery efforts, whatever that recovery may look like for the peer that we're working with. So, family social Recovery Capital is indicated by the willingness of say intimate partners and family members to maybe participate in the recovery process,"
No," in the treatment process. The presence of other people, right? In recovery, within our family or within our social network that can help support, right? Those are maybe accountability partners or mentors or sponsors, right? Because we need both."
Environment," for sobriety based things, like things that we may want to do as hobbies, leisure time, fellowship? Do we have a relational connections to the institutions in our community like school, our workplace, church, other community organizations like I'm in the middle,"
No," And then are we building relationships within those, so that we can live a better life? Next, we look at community capital and with community capital, sorry, one second. My throat got dry. Thanks everybody."
No," We look at things here that encompass the attitudes in our community, the policies, the resources, when it comes to addiction and recovery, those things that maybe promote a resolution of the problems that we're seeing in our community surrounding the chaotic use of alcohol"
No," and other drugs, right? So, community Recovery Capital, would probably include things like a visible and diverse local recovery role models. So, do we have those people in our community that are recovering out loud, showing people in the community"
Environment," and be vocal about where they were and where they are now. And a piece that I would add to that is I would make sure that I go through a, How to Tell My Story Training. We go through that through like the CPS training, the Certified Peer Specialist Training. I know that's another training"
No," that I've come into communities and done is come in for several hours and teach people the importance of the words we use. So, we can shy away from some of those words that may cause people to instantly have a negative thoughts or mind pictures. And instead use words that may garner more compassion"
No," and all the amazing things we've added to our life since then? So, I think those things are extremely important as we look at that community capital and becoming that community capital if our community doesn't already have those recovery role models."
No," Also is there a full continuum of treatment resources? Are there people that just, it's not just faithbased or a 12stepbased, it's also treatmentbased, there's access to medication, there's access to I would say a medication support group, family support group, use support groups,"
No," SMART Recovery, maybe things that we'll talk about here when we get to cultural capital, like maybe Dharma recovery or those things that are going to help people, all the way through, are their recovery community centers or dropin centers or Alano Clubs"
No," where people can go and have friendships and build those relationships with people. Are there those recovering mutual aid resources that I just got through talking about and if they are, are they diverse and accessible, right? Like when we started the Springfield Recovery Community Center,"
Environment," we brought in a faith, we started off with a faithbased meeting. A 12step meeting was actually a narcotics anonymous meeting that they started at the center. And then also SMART Recovery, which is selfmanagement and recovery training, which is secular evidencebased relies"
No," on cognitive behavioral and rational, emotive behavioral therapy tools that people can learn how to use themselves. So, maybe if somebody was turned off by the 12 steps or maybe if somebody, they don't have a Christian faith, they is still something for them to engage in."
No," Also like I said, those local recovery community supports, are really important, whether those are like recovery schools, recovery ministries or churches, Alano Clubs, recovery community centers, those types of things."
No," Maybe even alumni associations, I know I haven't seen a lot of those, but do the treatment providers have alumni associations or groups where they're getting together and supporting each other. And finally are there sources of sustained recovery support and maybe early opportunities for reintervention?"
No," And like when somebody starts to have a little hiccup, it's one of the reasons that the recovery community center here in Springfield, we provide like recovery checkup phone calls and we also provide a free recovery coaching for people in the community if they need it. So, maybe I am starting to have the,"
No," I've completed treatment or maybe I didn't even go through treatment, but it was something I was able to do on my own or through a faithbased or 12step or secular mutual support group or just with the circle of friends that I have that are family and social capital."
No," Maybe I was able to do it that way, but now I'm starting to have some issues that are coming up in my life, it's not bad enough that I really need to see a therapist. It's not bad enough that I need to go to outpatient or inpatient treatment, but I would like somebody to talk to,"
No," to maybe guide me through some of that. So, we have those, right? We also have, do we have things like employee assistance programs that are helping people that are family friendly that are helping them find not just a job, but a job that pays a living wage?"
No," Because a lot of times, it's really difficult if you have felonies, whether they're pending or convictions to find those jobs that are actually going to pay a salary, right? That you can actually support you and your family on, without having to work 70, 80 hours a week. Are there treatment courts,"
No," are there recovery community organizations? So, we kind of look at those different things too and that all falls under that community capital area. And finally, we have cultural capital. And cultural capital tends to be a form of community capital, right? But here it looks at,"
No," do we have culturally prescribed pathways of recovery that might resonate with different individuals and families? So, like in a native native American community, is there something like maybe the Wellbriety Movement, White Bison, The Red Road. AfricanAmerican communities, is there something like a faithbased recovery ministry."
No," For Buddhists or people who practice meditation yoga, things like that. Is there something, like those Dharma Recovery Groups available or recovery yoga available for them? So, is there things that match people's cultural needs? So, I guess the next thing we look at"
No," What the first study says is both its quantity and quality play a major role in determining the success or failure of natural and assisted recovery. So, it doesn't matter if somebody finds recovery on their own or through their social network or family network or if they find it through a treatment"
No," So, people are going to live better lives, because of it, right? Third one and I hate just reading slides, but it says strategies that target family and community Recovery Capital, can elevate longterm recovery outcomes as well as elevate the quality of life of individuals"
No," and families in longterm recovery. So, if we can target the community and the family and build capital there and get those communities recovery ready, what we're gonna see is that people's outcomes, are gonna be better. So, what that means is we're gonna have less recidivism,"
No," less people returning to that chaotic use, where they need help. So, instead of having that revolving door, we're able to actually utilize funds better for treatment. So, instead of seeing the same people over and over again, were able to see different, varied people, because people are actually able to engage"
Environment," with those resources in their community and sustain their recovery, instead of walking out of that quasisafe environment that might be treatment, back into the exact same community and place that they came out of. So again, it's why things like recovery residences,"
No," And we know that there's at least, there's some oversight, most clients that (murmurs), that one says, basically that when people don't have that family and community recovery, it really doesn't matter the treatment that they go through. They really don't gain a whole lot through it,"
No," unless that focuses on surrounding them or helping them find that family, social community resource. So once again, I think that's an important piece for us as peers is helping people build that, right? And making sure that our communities have those and that we're engaging in those."
No," When you have recovery residences, what kind of relationship do you have them? If you have dropin centers, recovery community centers, Alano Clubs, what kind of relationship do you have with those? If there isn't family support groups, is that something that maybe you're working"
No," on bringing to your community? And finally, that last one says that posttreatment recovery checkups when needed, early intervention. So, whenever we're able to get people help, a lot of times we can catch it early, which is why we have accountability partners"
No," that can maybe spot those things early. It's why we have recovery checkup phone calls. It's why we have recovery coaches. It's why we have community centers and dropin centers, so that we're able to engage with those people that may be seeing some issues and actually catch those issues,"
No," before they become huge obstacles, right? I'd rather catch something very early. So, we need to engage people with low Recovery Capital through, I mean just be really aggressive about those, that community outreach, what are we doing, right? Even like hitting bottom,"
No," maybe they don't have hope, they don't feel that they have the ability or they can't see any place that might give them the opportunity to change that chaotic use to address the issues that drive. Because as most of us know chaotic substance use, really isn't the problem for most people,"
No," it's the solution for most problem. There's underlying issues that we have to address. And if we just address alcohol and other drugs, really a lot of times that's the bandaid, that's the scab. And we're ripping that off. And just allowing the wind to gush."
No," What we actually need to do is address the wound and maybe people won't need to use chaotically, once that trauma is addressed, once they are on medication that can help them with their depression, anxiety, other mental health disorders, diagnoses, maybe if we can reduce some of that,"
No," are people getting adequate sleep and rest? Did they have energy or they're fatigued? Are they living in pain and discomfort or are they pain and discomfort free? With psychological, they look at things more like, body image, negative feelings, positive feelings."
No," So, let's work on that concentration, right? Am I able to learn new skills and then translate that into what I do? Do I have the ability to make good decisions, right? When we look at that level of independence with the World Health Organization, they look at things more like a mobility in ADL's"
No," and ADL's are like activities of daily living, right? So, can I bathe? Am I able to get myself up in the morning, get myself dressed? Can I feed myself? Am I able to get out? How reliant am I on medication"
No," or treatment or counseling that I'm going to? Do I have a work capacity? Whether it's paid or volunteer, so that I have something meaningful to engage in. Well, social relationships, pretty easy, right? Personal relationships, family relationships,"
No," kinship relationships, sexual activity, for a lot of people that's a pretty big thing. Honestly, none of us would be here without it, right? So, it's definitely something that's important for us to look at and address and be able to do that in a manner that, a serious manner."
Environment," We talk about it in the CPS training, it's the reason a lot of people stop medication is because of things like that, right? Because it impacts their sexual functioning. It's also a reason that some people may utilize substances, because it gives me, I just don't know how to talk to somebody,"
Environment," unless I've had a few drinks or unless I've done this or that. So, we look at all, they look at all that with social relationships, with environmental, they look at some of the same things we talked about, right? Financial resources, access to services, home environment,"
Environment," physical safety and security, access to transportation, those types of things. And finally spirituality looks at personal beliefs, religion, lack of religion, whatever. And once again, with the CPS training, we have the FICA, which is a tool that you can use to identify, just how important faith and belief is to somebody,"
No," because you may have somebody, in fact I know tons of people that consider themselves extremely spiritual that are atheist and agnostic. So, religion honestly for many people has nothing to do with spirituality and vice versa, for other people it does."
No," but the first time I saw a matrix like this was in treatment court, they have what they call the RANT and that stands for the Risks and Needs Triage. And basically what the RANT does is it looks at risk factors like age of substance use when it started, criminal activity,"
No," had they been to treatment multiple times? And then it also looked at those criminogenic needs, things like mental health diagnosis, chronic medical conditions, unemployment, homelessness, substance use. And it allowed us to see, to place people on kind of,"
No," maybe things that are missing in our community that we can add. Like if you go back, man, 2016 we didn't have a recovery community center in Springfield. So, I partnered with two other people to start one. And for the first year we paid for it out of our own pocket."
No," But at the same time, I also advocated to the Department of Mental Health, over and over and over again the need for it, especially in a world of parody, right? Where we have mental health dropin centers, but no recovery community centers that are funded through the state."
No," is quite a few more questions and right here, once again we're measuring Recovery Capital for people. What my peers do here at the Springfield Recovery Community Center is a BARC 10 . And we do it every time we meet with somebody. And it's 10 questions where somebody rates themselves"
No," Do you strongly agree? Does it fall somewhere in the middle? Once again, we're writing that on a one to six scale. The next question it says, I have enough energy to complete the tasks I set for myself? So, whenever we have those goals and things that we need to get done every day,"
No," are we able to get those done or do we run out of steam? Do we get distracted and then spend our energy on other things, because we don't have that focus? Number four, it says I'm proud of the community I live in and I feel a part of it."
No," And I want to reiterate here. I don't mean the recovery community you're part of, I don't mean the faithbased community you are part of. Here it says the community you live in. And like, I live in Springfield, Missouri. I'm part of a recovery community and a faith community and man, I am very proud of those communities."
No," I would somewhat agree. I'm a little proud of the community I live in. I do feel like we have some amazing things, like the Greenways and we'd gotten some good media attention and focus on some of the substance use problems that are going on. But man, we have a long ways to go,"
No," before we're addressing those things well, right? So, yeah, this doesn't mean this is actually the recovery, the community that you live in, right? Are you proud of it? And do you feel like you're part of it? Do you engage in things that make your community better, right?"
No," And once again, this is where a lot of times people flip to recovery community, ""Well, I set up chairs, I do this."" I mean, yes, but the community you live in, I think a lot of times it was a big shift for me and another one of those secret,"
No," like I said it was one of the secret sauces when I realized that I didn't just have to relegate myself to being part of a recovery community, but I could actually be a contributing member of the community that I lived in and people would support me and interact with me and see me as an equal,"
No," even if we had completely different life experiences. Question five, I get lots of support from friends? This is positive support, not negative support, right? Once again, looking at those friends, are those are the type of people whose lives you'd wanna have? If you have kids, nieces, nephews, younger brothers"
No," with those knuckleheads, right. So, I get lots of positive support from friends. I regard my life as challenging and I don't know why that says if, but I regard my life as challenging and fulfilling, without the need for using drugs or alcohol, right? Once again, one strongly disagree, six strongly agree."
No," I have people in my life that are professionals that I work with to help make my life and my community better. And finally, am I making good progress on my recovery journey? If so, that's amazing. Once again,"
No," that you're willing to do in the next week to move you closer to a well, to get you to maybe where that score improves. I really hope that from here you able to, is there any questions and from here, I really hope that you add a couple more goals to this and you add a few more things to your todo list"
No," and that you consistently focus on doing a few things, every week that are going to increase your Recovery Capital. And if you're a certified peer specialist or a family support provider or a Missouri recovery support specialist, I really hope that this is something that you incorporate into your practice"
No," and start using with the people you're supporting. (upbeat music) So, I think so far I have seen one question and it really didn't deal with the Recovery Capital, but in some ways maybe it does, but it was a how can I help a loved one that's using drugs and alcohol."
No," And I would say one of the best books that I've ever read is ""Beyond Addiction: How Science ""and Kindness Help People Change."" It had kind of taken a craft, which is community reinforcement and family therapy tools and put it into a way so that families can introduce them."
No," And it looks at a lot of things like self care. Like at the end of the day, I still have to make sure that I'm taking care of me and the rest of my family, even though I have a loved one that's actively using, because if we're not well, it's going to be really hard for us"
No," I mean, reach out to people in your community. If you have a recovery community center, I think Sheila you may live in St. Louis. So, next one. Why do people say drug and alcohol is a disease? It's your choice, No one told you to drink that drink,"
No," in our body that can be identified. So, scientifically it's labeled as a disease, just like why do people call lung cancer a disease when you chose to smoke that cigarette? People engage in an activity that leads to the development of a disease in the body. I hope that clears that one up for you Myron."
No," Lorinda, yeah, honestly I think that this can help us deal with a lot of things, right? Recovery Capital I mean, everybody's in a recovery from something, right? So, what I'm thinking is, honestly you can use this in just about every aspect."
No," I mean, do I have the things I need in my community to support me? Do I have the things that I need socially? Do I have the family or friends around? So, I think if we look at that, we can find ways to heal from just about anything we may have"
No," to some people have not really explored that before. So, thanks for bringing that to us today. You are just always a plethora of information and I am just so grateful that you have such a great energy and way of sharing your information and you have absolutely just,"
No," especially a community where a lot of people are either living in recovery from whatever their behavioral health diagnosis is or working with people that are either living with active, chaotic, behavioral health issues or in the process of recovery to give them a tool,"
No," And so that you're not just looking like you say at the big giant picture or the entire elephant, but you're just looking at one meal at a time, one bite at a time. Absolutely, I love that analogy. This has been great. I hope you're able,"
No, I hope you're seeing all of the great comments to you as well. Lots of good information. People's completely agree with the way that you tackle the subject. And I know that they're gonna walk away with some really awesome newly gained information
No," and able to hopefully take it back to their own communities and use this, so awesome. That's why we do the Real Voices Real Choices Conference to begin with. Exactly. So, that we have so many amazing people that are in recovery from whatever that thing is"
No," that they're living with that are coming to this and seeing A, that they're not alone and B getting information from other people that have lived experience with other things that the Department of Mental Health addresses. To me this will always, I'm involved with a lot of conferences."
No," because everyone on here has lived experience. So, thank you guys very much for letting me be part of this conference for another year, it's amazing. Absolutely and you have honored us with your energy, your presence and your information and thank you for the time and commitment"
No," that you put into helping with the committee to help pull this event off every year. And although it has changed, due to the pandemic just a little bit the last year or two, I have a great hope that we will be together again. And I'm looking forward to that. And I know lots of people are looking forward"
No," This video is suggested by one of our viewers, Army & Blink! Thanks for the suggestion! Now, lets get started. Have you been wondering if your mental health is possibly getting worse? Mental health, just like physical health, affects everyone whether you are suffering from a mental illness or not. Your mental and emotional health can fluctuate from time to time depending on the stresses going on in your life. So, it’s always a good idea to check in with yourself and try to gauge the direction your mental health is going in."
No," With that said, here are ten signs that your mental health is getting worse. NUMBER ONE. You’re losing interest in the little things. Do your favorite activities suddenly seem meh to you? If you’ve started to lose excitement for life’s little things, then this is a sign that your mental health might not be at its best. You might be feeling this way because of an overload of stress in your life, or you’re feeling overwhelmed with all of your responsibilities and todo lists. When you lose interest and don’t enjoy the hobbies and activities that you once did, this could also"
No," be a warning sign of depression. If you think this could be what's happening to you, know that you are not alone, and that help is just around the corner. Talk with a trusted friend or a family member, or a mental health professional to get the help you need to navigate these troubling times. NUMBER TWO. You get overwhelmed easier. Do you find that you’ve been getting overwhelmed more often than normal? When you have a todo list for two or three tasks, does it feel more like you have ten things to do? When you start to get overwhelmed easily with everyday things,"
No," this could be a sign of worsening mental health. According to Psychotherapist, Sheri Jacobson, feeling mentally overwhelmed could be an internal reaction to excessive outside stress. To help cope with this overwhelming feeling, you can journal, meditate, or practice mindfulness. NUMBER THREE. You don’t feel like socializing that much anymore. Does it feel more exhausting to interact with people nowadays? Regardless of whether you’re an introvert, extrovert, or somewhere in between, we all have a standard comfort level when it comes to social interaction."
No," Skillshare has a great intro class on animation that we really recommend. The course is called “Creativity Unleashed: Discover, Hone, and Share Your Voice Online” by Johannes Fast. If any of you are interested in learning basic animation, I recommend you go check it out in the link below! The first 1000 people will get a free trial of Skillshare Premium and after that, it’s only around $10 a month. Let us know what Skillshare courses you’re taking in the comments below. FOUR. You don’t have a consistent sleep schedule."
No," Have you developed a seemingly random sleep schedule? Despite wanting to get up at a certain time in the morning, do you wind up sleeping all day? When you have an irregular sleep schedule, this could signify increased stress in your life and a decline in your mental health. If you're struggling to regulate your sleep, you can try setting up a routine to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day. This will get your body back into its regular rhythm of sleep and wake cycles, therefore no longer causing sleep disturbance. FIVE. You always feel drained."
No," Despite getting enough sleep and eating well, do you constantly feel exhausted or drained? According to Healthline, mental exhaustion can set in when you are under longterm stress and this type of exhaustion can make it feel like you are trying to move up a mountain. More than just feeling tired, when you are this drained and constantly exhausted, you might struggle to get anything done. Healthline suggests practicing gratitude, relaxation, and yoga, as well as talking to a mental health professional to provide medication for you if it’s needed. Treatment plans will look different for everyone, but regardless,"
No," there is a way that will work best for you to help pull yourself out of this state of exhaustion. SIX. Your anxiety seems to be increasing. Do you wake up in the morning with a crushing sense of anxiety that stays with you all day? Does this anxiety cast a cloud over your daily activities? Worsening anxiety can often coincide with worsening mental health. Anxiety affects us all, whether or not you happen to suffer from a particular anxiety disorder. It’s important to monitor your anxiety levels because a noticeable change can tell you a lot about your mental health."
No," Anxiety is a response to stress and it can cause a variety of psychological and physical symptoms. When you feel overly anxious, you might notice that your heart rate speeds up and your breathing rate increases, and you might experience a bout of nausea SEVEN. You feel mentally and emotionally scattered. Do you feel like there are so many things happening around you, but you can’t focus on any of them? If so, you’re not alone. From time to time, it’s normal to feel this way, especially when you are going through higher amounts of stress. However,"
No," if you are feeling scattered and like things are spinning out of control, this could be a sign that your mental health is under strain. According to Psychologist Rick Hanson from Psychology Today, you probably feel scattered because you are struggling to find your center. This means that in order for your brain to feel more organized, you need to feel at peace within yourself. Practicing mindfulness, such as yoga and meditation, are great places to start on the road to inner peace. EIGHT. You can’t seem to pay attention. Do you have a harder time focusing and staying on task?"
No," When you’re reading, is it hard to comprehend? Do you have to reread the same passage over and over again? Though it could relate to potential psychological disorders such as ADHD, depression, or anxiety, it is also likely that a lack of focus can be due to stress or poor selfcare. It can be frustrating to start losing focus so frequently and those feelings are valid and normal. Remember to take care of yourself and, as you recover, know that help is available. NINE. You might be struggling with your impulse control. Are you acting more on impulse? Are you possibly indulging in things you shouldn’t?"
No," Whether it’s retail therapy, or binging all of your shows, or playing video games for hours, when you act more on impulse like this, it can signify worsening mental health. You might pick up some unhealthy habits as a way to cope with life stress, fulfill yourself, or distract yourself from a major issue going on in your life. Journaling, mindfulness, and therapy are great ways to start uncovering some of these issues! TEN. You are struggling to feel grounded. Similar to feeling centered, when you are grounded, you are feeling confident"
No," and balanced within yourself. According to Irene Langeveld, an energy worker, and meditation coach, grounding starts with the root chakra at the base of the spine, known to help you feel secure. Activities that connect your body with the world around you– such as hiking, meditating, or walking outside –are all great ways to help you find your sense of grounding! Can you relate to any of these points made in this video? Do you think your mental health could be slipping? If so, know that there is help you can reach out to. You can talk to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health therapist for support."
Environment," Clinical evidence and our eq5d quality of life measures demonstrate that rehabilitation based exercises are absolutely key to successful treatment of bone and muscle conditions , hospitals and health centers do not provide the ideal environment for gym based"
Environment," activities , and we and our patients find that our gyms are An ideal venue , our experience in this video demonstrate people improving in the gym based environment , the transition from being passive patients growing in confidence to become healthier , happier self"
Environment," managing people in the community with less pain . Last month , in Merton over a thousand patients attended , and a hundred percent of respondents indicated that they would recommend our gym sessions in the NHS family and friends . Satisfaction test"
Environment, from Boston University . She 'S worked at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in 2015 and in December 2018 she transitioned to per diem roles at both Spaulding and Shriners Hospital for Children and in 2019 she joined the Boston University . Occupational therapy
No," today 's learning objectives we will first define quality of life and identify factors contributing to quality of life after stroke . We'Ll also understand the social , emotional and physical components , impacting health outcomes and quality of"
No," life for communitydwelling , stroke survivors and I say communitydwelling stroke survivors because most of the literature that I looked at looks at at least 6 to 12 months , post , stroke , post injury and up To almost 5 years , so they 're , typically in the community at"
Environment," suggests quality of life represents the widest range of human experience encompassing constructs beyond health , including such areas as material wellbeing , neighborhood safety , spirituality and the environment . So that means this comprehensive view of quality"
No," of life includes not only physical health but also psychological health , social relationships and environmental quality and personal beliefs . I also like another definition that I found a literature by Patrick and Erickson that emphasizes healthrelated quality of"
No," life , which is the value assigned to duration of life as modified by impairments , functional status , perceptions and opportunities influenced by disease , injury , treatment and policy . So when you consider the what makes up quality of life , we do n't treat quality"
No," of life per se , but rather focus on the individual components looking up the contract . So what are those individual components making up the construct of quality of life , poststroke , there 's emotional distress and depression , activity limitations and"
Environment," , depression I 'll put these up , so you could read through it decrease participation and ability to be independent in ADL 's and functional mobility , selfcare selfefficacy and just overall quality of life and then education level . So extensive"
No," survivors experience , so here are some facts . Taken from the literature post stroke , depression is fairly common . A majority of stroke survivors lacked an important or meaningful activity to fill the day and required assistance with at least one ADL or activity of daily"
No," living , the most affected domains . It 'S indicated on the stroke . Specific quality of life scale was in work , productivity , social roles , personality , energy and family roles and lastly , it has been described that there is a direct association among knowledge of stroke"
Environment," , income and education that impacts adherence to treatment and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle . So we 'll keep these in mind as they will help inform our intervention which we 'll discuss later . So what are the active ingredients that are leading to these predictors of"
Environment," us find a solution to intervene accordingly , since we do know that higher quality of life is associated with greater independence and daily living and mobility , higher education level and better socioeconomic level and Social support , conversely , worse quality of life"
Environment," is associated with anxiety , depression and fatigue . So some of these factors we can adjust , there are modifiable , we can adjust socioeconomic level and status , but we can look at participation and engagement in meaningful occupations . We could look at health , education and"
No," well as health promotion strategies that aim to control risk factors for stroke patients . So it is important to understand these risk factors for lower quality of life , things that could impede community reintegration , and this is in fact where most research has focused , but"
No," arguably , in order to provide effective interventions , it is just as important to understand what sorts of things Are protective or associated with better community reintegration and quality of life ? So we 're going to look at the self efficacy of and building resilience"
Environment," which individuals acquire and maintain behavior , while also considering the social environment in which individuals perform the behavior . It is important to note that , when considering environment , there are most definitely health inequities that exist in various areas ."
No," So it is important to consider availability and accessibility of resources , social and cultural norms and systems in place that can facilitate or impede behavior change when working with clients of different races and backgrounds , and the I 'm just going to"
Environment," typical interaction of person , environment and behavior . And then you have behavioral factors or behavioral capability which refers to a person 's actual ability to perform a behavior through essential knowledge and skills . So in order to successfully perform a"
Environment," behavior , a person must know what to do and how to do it . So people learn from the consequences of their behavior , which also affects the environment in which they live , which leads me to observational learning . So this asserts that people can witness and observe the"
Environment," reinforcements refer to the internal or external responses to a person 's behavior that effect the likelihood of continuing or discontinuing the behavior , so reinforcements can be self initiated or in the environment , and reinforcements can be positive or negative . So this is"
Environment," the construct of SCT that most closely ties to the reciprocal relationship between behavior and environment , and there are expectations which refer to the anticipated consequences of a person 's behavior . People anticipate the consequences of their actions"
No," before engaging in the behavior , and these anticipated consequences can influence successful completion of the behavior . And so it 's important to note , while expectancy is derived from previous experience , expectancies focus on the value that is placed on the"
No," outcome and are subjective to the individual . So that 's really where it 's coming into a very person centred approach where it has to be a high value for that individual and lastly , there 's selfefficacy , which we went over briefly . But that refers to the level of the"
No," come to life having and responding new information and building on inherent strengths and capabilities . So that 's what this is really all about : the strengths based approach . There are a few underlying assumptions that have to be made with this theory , one of which is"
No," that individuals are assumed to understand their own needs better than anyone else and therefore should have the power both to define and act upon them , and all people possess strengths . Upon which they can build empowerment is a lifelong endeavor , which is key to"
No, that will help improve quality of life and help you think more forward ? So the empowerment theory promotes health and wellbeing in the context of the strengths . Focused approach related to active participation in an individual 's personal health will emphasize that
No," active participation through our intervention as rehab professionals . We are getting good at identifying deficits and weaknesses that we target for intervention or compensation , but equally important is to be able to identify retained strengths . As these will be the"
No, enable personalized healthcare . So the koppen was developed as a client centered tool to enable individuals to identify and prioritize everyday issues that restrict or impact their performance in everyday living . So one of the strengths of the measure is its
Environment," broad focus on performance in all areas of life , including selfcare , leisure and productivity . So you can see the three different areas here . Using an interview format . The client , then , is able to self identify specific tasks that are more difficult , now say , poststroke and then"
Environment," intervention goals . And I will say it was to design for use by occupational therapists at a cost and with a training manual , but the overall concepts are relevant and important for non OTS alike , as the principles of rating one 's importance of various activities in"
No," and you can see there are twelve domains that they cover energy , family rules , language mobility , mood , personality , selfcare , social roles , thinking upper extremity , function , vision and work in productivity . So it seems like a lot of domains and a lot of questions , but it 's"
Environment," actually fairly quick to administer . It takes about 1015 minutes to administer no prior training , anyone can do it and it also can be answered by proxies . So that is a plus two , so it is pretty accessible and free . So now we 're going to dive into the or intervention and"
Environment," daily activities as well as workrelated tasks , so we filled out the koppen we 've identified some areas of selfcare and leisure work that are of vital importance to the client and now we 're ready to intervene . So , let 's look at social activities here are some examples"
No," gatherings that may be difficult for our clients , with after they 've experienced a stroke . One of those that I am that I do want to highlight a lot of the barriers . Most of the time is communication , so it 's learning to go back into these social groups with limited communication"
No," in Boston , we have a lot of access them to adaptive sports through the hospital through community groups for any sort of summer winter activity which can be really nice . It 'S not just for people who have had strokes , but it 's for people of all abilities , so it 's kind of nice to"
No," have that it 's social and recreational at the same time , or even just thinking of any other hobbies that someone has and accessing those hobbies . So let 's say someone really likes to read , then it would be our job to find ways to access that more easily to increase"
No," really do n't know what is important to someone until you interview them . It does correlate with caregiver relationships so that we 'll talk about next , but sometimes it 's really important for someone to be able to go to the bathroom independently and they do n't really care"
No," about being able to brush their teeth or put a shirt on . They just want to be able to pull their pants up and down to go to the bathroom independently , so they do n't have to call their caregiver . So it 's really this collaborative goalsetting prioritization that we really need to"
No," focus on and it 's a hundred percent personcentered . I also want to highlight that all of these intervention strategies are using a strengths based approach , we 're using what that person has and building upon those strengths , and another thing to highlight is that"
No," we 're also always integrating energy conservation when we 're doing any sort of physical activity . So that that could be a barrier for participation in social , recreational or occupational activities . The next we 'll talk about social roles and social supports , so there are"
No," oftentimes changes in roles , that 's pretty common following stroke , so there 's either like a role , loss or a role reversal . So let 's say the primary provider is no longer able to work and provide financially for the family . So then that role is switched to the other"
No," husband . Why a partner whatever it may be . So there 's this feeling of sense of purpose to provide in a role . So it 's important to consider these new roles of how you can redefine that purpose . So I 've added volunteering and mentoring , cuz I 've learned from some patients who"
No," about social support and I do want to highlight the importance of a caregiver support . That is a whole other talk for another day , but I do want to note that a majority of stroke survivors when they return to the community implore rely on support in some way or another , and often"
No," longterm from an informal or a family caregiver , so providing support . Emotionally and psychologically prepares patients to face various reintegration challenges with greater ease . So , as that 's the important role caregivers play deserves our attention and"
No," unfortunately many strokes , caregivers may experience financial strain decrease social contact and activity and decrease mental and physical health , so similar risk factors as our stroke survivors , but the health of the stroke caregiver directly affects the Stroke survivor"
No," essentially , as the caregiver is less able to care for themselves . They are less able to provide care and support for their loved one impacting their survivors quality of life . There have found significant correlations between caregivers wellbeing and stroke"
No," , survivors , quality of life and community reintegration . So interventions targeted at reducing caregiver burden may help improve both caregivers and survivors wellbeing in quality of life . So it 's important to address caregivers , health and quality of life and wellbeing , not"
Environment," the focus of today 's talk , but it 's worth diving into it another day . Our third construct providing health education , so one of the strategies that can be helpful . Excuse me , it is learning to control what you can to reduce risk where possible so making lifestyle"
Environment," changes , such as diet exercise , smoking , alcohol use , can increase one sense of control and selfefficacy moving from a passive or a helpless victim into a more actionoriented mode , which is A much healthier frame of mind psychologically right , that 's all about the empowerment"
No," theory , so stress management is another important skill to learn both because stress is another risk factor , but also because poorly managed stress leads to increase in anxiety , depression and substance , misuse which could decrease quality Of life - and it is important to"
Environment," emphasize that education provided should be in a way that promotes selfmanagement of these various risk factors so you 're not just teaching at your clients , you 're , providing selfmanagement strategies , that 's an oven , talking itself as well , providing um"
No," selfmanagement strategies for stroke . Survivors , but there are many resources available that hold clients accountable for taking control of these risk factors , including keeping a health log for food or alcohol , or a sleep log using a recipe book catered specifically for that"
Environment, person and to accommodate any comorbidities medication management tools . Ongoing exercises and some exercise programs for both physical health and brain health as well so contract number for increasing selfefficacy is really highly
No," interpret physiological signs such as anxiety , stress and know what to do about them . So , in order to develop a healthy sense of self and one 's selfesteem , there are certain tasks or challenges that need to be addressed . There are tasks that we are all faced with as we"
No," grow up and make our way into the world as psychologically healthy and functioning adults . So , following a stroke , these may well require different solutions , different ways of thinking about oneself relative to solutions from the past . So again , building on that"
No," strengths foundation , so last one is , it is building resilience , so , lastly , we need to help our clients build resilience again . This is an ongoing lifelong endeavor . It 'S does n't end after you check a box , so stroke survivors may be at risk for low resilience , which was"
No," communicating feelings , life engagement , effective problemsolving fulfilled . So this is again where the empowerment Theory ties in nicely when we think about wanting to build upon the client 's inherent strengths , there 's a lot of emphasis on hope and positivity shifting"
Environment," to an internal locus of control where the client has control over his/her or their attitudes . Preparations and effort and making meaning out of a challenge with a flexible view of success , so the onus shifts the climate again , making that recovery process more active than"
No, conclusions from the literature on resilience that states that those who are more resilient have significantly fewer depressive symptoms and report higher quality of life in spite of relatively high levels of pain or fatigue .
No," Additionally , across a 3year study , stroke survivors with higher resilience demonstrated higher social functioning and less depression . So there are a lot of wonderful health outcomes out of having a high resilience . So , in summary , there are these five constructs that"
No," help with the social supports . I still encourage . I think family members play a huge role in motivating our client . So even when I 'm working with a client we 've had a no visitor policy , then we could call a family member on FaceTime . If we have the technology available to"
No," technology and I think it 's been incredibly useful and I 'm just thinking a barrier that I 've experienced is the communication having to amass yes , whether online or you know virtually with I 'm in a mask and there I 'm talking to a family member . But I ca n't ca n't"
No," enunciation for those who have trouble it 's it 's been a challenge with kovat , that 's for sure , um . Anyone else with questions for our speaker , okay , so this uh presentation can be viewed later on for the rest of the group , we 'll send a link once it 's"
No," Really just gives us um more energy to keep doing what we 're doing in our own little way , whatever it is um . Thank you so much , dr Katz . Thank you . Everyone for joining us and taking the time today to sign on and see you for our next virtual happy hour"
No," therapist ? You know what what do we do ? Right this is a common question that I get from people when I 'm out in the community when you know I 'm out and about and when people know that I 'm a physical therapist , that 's a very common question that they ask me a lot of"
Environment," people actually do n't know What the physical therapist does , or what physical therapy is very common misconception there . So physical therapy is massage , and you know exercise things like that now , so I want to answer you know . I want to answer that question so for me , what is"
Environment," for pain , so yeah pain they try to get rid of the pain or to try to work on the pain or they give you some exercise or some stretching to help you you know get . You know get less stiff or if actually the physical therapy place is , is much nothing much better . They can actually"
Environment," help you restore your normal function , all right , because then you know there 's a lot of different physical therapy places some of them . They , just you know , help you with some pain or and give you a few exercises , and you know basically that 's it . So the physical therapy place"
No," , alright , so and I 'll take you brief you briefly . This , what the steps are so the first is pain relief . So this is the first step in a program pathway , there 's a lot of people when they have an injury , they have certain condition and they have pain . So"
No," we try to address that pain . Try to control the pain , so they 'll be able to move up to the next level the next level . The next step is to restore function right , because that 's everybody wants to be able to get back to normal to be . You know back to fully functioning"
No," to be back to themselves right , so they 'll be able to be productive . You know be with their family play sports with their kids or you know be able to do work , so they can make more money all right . So that 's the next step , that 's the second step now , aside from that , we take"
Environment," they get discharge from physical therapy . I want them to be able to maintain that level of pain , relief or maintain that level of function and to prevent being hurt again , so I we make sure that we give them the patient education exercises that we 'll be able to do that ."
No," So , for me , that 's the next step is to prevent further injuries , to prevent recurring the injury and to maintain that level of function , level of health , all right or level of pain relief , and then , after that , I like to have patients gold a couple of steps . Further , even the"
No," example , you have arthritis which is very common or back pains . Those can be attributed to being overweight , which we see a lot of people being already . If you , if you look online studies , have shown that there 's a very , very big number of Americans that"
No," will have less pain , and I discussed that in some of my videos . Some of the effects of you know having you know , losing weight or having a good diet . How that affects your pain level , all right . So the next couple of steps that I want patients who go to get to is the fitness"
No," and the wellness level . So that way , they 'll be able to live , healthy , they 'll , be able to the pain , free and they 'll be able to live . You know very productive lives . Alright , so different places have different things , but for us we like to"
No," it might be bias , but at least I think physical therapists are the most qualified to guide patients through all those stages . All right . I would like to love to hear your comments feel free to leave your comments below and if you have any pain , any or any questions when"
No," regards to you know restoring function or how to prevent injuries or in terms of the you know . The fitness and wellness feel free to give us a call . You see the number some of the page - most probably it 's gon na , be below and feel free to share this with your friends and family"
No," Welcome to religion , religious experiences and spirituality chapter six , so we will be discussing about um our personal values in religions . So in chapter six , then we will be having two sections or two must expand"
No," because in sections in chapter 6 , as well as chapter 7 and chapter learning outcomes for chapter 6 , which is personal values , first , is looking at the commonality of the golden rule . And then we will be understanding the"
No," religion 's view on compassion and humility , knowing how respect shapes a family and society . We will have to recognize why hope gets us through despair , figuring out , why honesty is n't always the best policy and discover how patients"
No," pays off ? So let 's go to the golden rule or the universal principle , so alumni ask a child um . Well , how would you like it if someone did that to you , so that is the basic principle of golden rule very familiar"
No," what hurt us hurts others and what heals us , heals others . You have to share it with other people , so you meaning nongolden bull , so in nearly all the world 's religion . Personal morality begins with this simple concept treat others , as you would"
No," like to be treated as such . The golden rule is perhaps the most basic of the personal virtues , so in nearly all of the world religions , so the different faith have all have their own version of this universal message so , for example , islam"
No," hadith of an away 13 islam , not one of you , as Is a believer until he desires for his brothers what he desires for himself , hinduism said : wo n't not others . Do"
No, no one injury by thought or deeds . Other no word to pain thy fellow creatures or in words or in action to other people so analytics to in confucianism . It says do not do not do to others what you would not like yourself
No," um in luke , chapter 6 , verse 27 to 36 mahakit . Another young golden is far beyond loving your neighbor by introducing the christian effects of also loving your enemy in chapter 6 , 27 to 36 number of loop ."
No," But i say unto you , which here love your enemies do good to them , which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them , which despitefully use you and unto him that 's thee and on the cheek offer also the other and him that take it away . That"
No," if ye land to them , whom ye hope to receive what thank , what think of ye for sinners , also lent the sinners to receive as much again but great and ye shall be the children of the Highest for he is kind unto the unthankful"
No," so . It is very connected to our next section , which is compassion . So the word compassion means to suffer with having compassion . Compassion means that you can feel other 's pain"
No," the pain of other people . Therefore , we imitate the infinite kindness and mercy of god , therefore , nothing getting closer , the entire , oh , my god , musical chair , so they seem , god has through two thrones throne of compassion and young throne of"
No," did god ? Do ? God got up from the throne of judgment and sat on the throne of mercy from that throne , the throne of mercy , god created the world during the jewish penitential season . The prayer urge god"
No," Maybe it is time for us to repent of our sins and ask for the mercy of god . Ask that god will sit on the throne of mercy instead of the throne of judgment , so on the central virtuoso man . Buddhism is karuna understanding and identifying"
No," that needs them . So in hinduism , compassion is called daya sodaya and , along with charity , selfcontrol is one of the three central virtues of hinduism . Let 'S go now to section three , which is humility"
No," , so humility in most monetaristic religion . It is a sign of respect , for god , an awareness that all blessing flows from god to whom all thinks is jew . In judaism , for example , moses is considered virtuous primarily because of"
No," religious statement of humility in the sermon of on the mount . It says blessed be the might , for they shall inherit the earth matthew chapter 5 , verse 5 . So this is a sermon on the mount jesus pointed here which other religion"
No," prizes , so in islam , humility means surrender . It is a primary virtue for the muslims demonstrate their awareness of the greatness of god and humankind 's place in the world by observing the five pillars of their faith . Each pillar enforces or reinforces"
No," the proper order of the universe . Sadao wesem naman focuses believers thoughts on the awesome , beauty and wonder of nature . As we ponder the magnificence of nature , we learn to respect our place relative to the stars and the season of"
No," a humbling experience . So true , humility , naman , yu , manga buddhist can release anger and learn to live a life free from attachment and suffering . So sabingan is suta nipata . Why are n't you art , thou angry , be not angry . Tusa"
No," meekness is best for thee and to restrain anger . Conceit and hypocrisy is best . It is for this that we live the righteous life . So let 's go to section four , which is respect so respect . It means"
No," um , respect for parents , respect for our ancestor , respect for your teachers and clergy and all find powerful universal support . As a virtue in the world 's religion , so in judaism and christianity , respect for parents is literally means honor , so capacity"
No," them and obey them in islam , naman the quran enjoins muslim to honor and cherish their parents . It says , and thy lord has this decree that you do good to your parents if there is either of both of them . Reach old age with thee . Do not speak one word of contempt to"
No," man and the australian , aboriginals and native american tribal religions . People often pray not to god , but to their dead relatives and holy people of the tribe . They respect and worship the ancestors who are worthy of veneration . Those who live good and fruitful life , so"
No," past to the new generation . So next is the virtue of hope in many secret , jewish christian and islamic texts . The ritual includes the idea of hope in christianity . It 'S one of the three"
No," cardinal virtues so anabayon , three cardinal virtues , faith , hope and love . So union iii , cardinal virtues and christianity , faith , hope love in islaman . It is the understanding that allah knows all what"
No," happens happens for a reason and the faithful will be rewarded in paradise and irreligious punish in hell . So in the world , religions hope is made possible by human limitations . So most people do n't"
No," know the future and because they do n't know it , they fear , it hope , reduces . The fear in religion . Hope is closely linked with what comes after death , so , for example , in some verse chapter 23 , the great poem attributed to king david remains one of the classic"
No," me in the path of righteousness for him for his namesake , even though i walk to the valley of the shadow of that , i , i fear no evil for thou art with me , their rod and thy staff . They comfort me thou , prepare us the table before me in the presence of my enemies . Thou annoyances"
No," , my head with all my cup overflows . Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the dates of my life , and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever . So for christians , young hope is that sustain them in"
No, in the hope for thus be the coming of the lord jesus as christ and eternal life in heaven . So this hopes to stay in christian through what they often perceive to be the immor morality of the earthly kingdom
No," , christian god . You hope that christ will come again . So that is why christ is the living hope . Therefore , you were hoping that christ will come again for the second coming of christ and then everything the immorality of this world will come to"
No," its end . So , of course , monotheistic faith are n't the only one that considers hope , as a virtue in buddhism hope spring from the idea that the person can attain enlightenment . So religious hopefulness is not the same"
No," You do n't see the whole picture because you 're still in that situation and the incompleteness of human , knowing is met by the hope , so young hope you know saturn and push to go through that the world hold more promise than we can see from their limited perspective"
No," and Um , section 6 or last part for this , for this section or part num um chapter six , which is personal values , is young . That is the highest form of happiness , so happiness is somewhat temporal , but joy is something that is eternal ."
No," connected to hope . Joy is also a central because it reminds us to be faithful , although things are not okay , so religious choice connect happiness with selflessness , selflessness rather than"
No," with selfishness , and in this way it offers a real alternative to buy it and you 'll be happy mentality of the culture Based on consumerism , every religion teaches the lesson of joy in similar , yet different ways has many senses and the psalmists tell"
No," anger is , but for a moment for his favor is for a lifetime . Weeping may tie you for the night , but joy cometh in the morning , psalm chapter 35 , verse 9 in my soul , shall be joyful in jehovah or in my soul , shall be joyful in yahweh . It shall"
No," joy , so this uses one of um joy , you say : connect it to the appreciation of god , love and caring , a trust in god 's salvation and hope that um promises of tomorrow will wipe away the burdens Of the present , so new testament um"
No," , the personal quality of joyousness , comes from knowing that god loves you or you carries and partaking in the act of loving unification with god through the eucharist or the remembrance of the lord 's sacrifice , so"
No," it um let jews christian , believes That joy is a gift of god and a response to god 's salvation and love according to christians , the death and resurrection of jesus brings the joy of salvation to christians . They see jesus 's sufferings as a model of living , even in their own"
No," struggle and pain . They can still have the joy knowing that they 're following the example of jesus life , in that , in this way , joy can coexist with pain , because joy transforms the pain into an example of god 's love , as it once was with jesus ."
No," So we see that we can be still be joyful or predict , because jesus is our example as christian people , so in the islam . Let 'S talk about the beliefs in the eastern religion in the"
No," east , boat , buddhist and hinduism are aimed at letting go of attachment and emotions and and illusions of this world . So you may think that could seem to be one of those attachments , but in fact many eastern religions have a deep sense of joy or more accurately , please"
No," buddhism is more intent on releasing the attachment from the world than hinduism , and so it has no real positive meaning for joy , joy or sukha . It 'S a quality that helps a person um , someone meditate better"
No," , eastern religions , discussion for this part . So next week we will be discussing seven more section of chapter chapter six , which is personal values"
No," This film is about mental health . Talking about it and listening to others , mental health is about our feelings , our thinking , our emotions and our moods . Everybody knows how to look after physical health , but looking after our mental health just as"
No," , good morning , sophie good morning , jay good morning , miss this film is all about jay and us we 're her friends , we 're all 10 or 11 years old , all in the same school live in the same area , but we 're all very different To each other"
No," mature and good , at getting her work done . How are big feelings affecting jay ? Am i in a jungle ? Am i in the seat ? My head is going crazy , will you come and save me ? My tummy hurts . I ca n't get to sleep at night . I ca n't concentrate at school . It"
No," feels like . I have a volcano inside of me getting hotter and hotter . Sometimes it might help to talk to someone about our feelings , but it can be hard to find the right person . Do you think your mum might know"
No," something 's wrong ? My mom has her own problems . She 'S not very well . I'Ve been looking after her . What about telling miss evelyn she 's always busy ? What about your sister ? I wanted to talk to her , but how could i say it ?"
No," , how could you be a good listener if you 're listening to someone you can lean forward or sit side by side , make them feel comfortable , always listen to them , give them your time and attention if you 're a friend , you might not Know"
No," Hey Psych2Goers, welcome back to our channel. Have you ever wondered what healthy habits you should add to your list of todo's? We all should give enough time and intention to our mental health, and what better way than to adopt some new, healthy habits along the way."
No," and reduce fatigue. The preliminary studies conclusions suggested that, adopting an upright posture may increase positive effect, reduce fatigue, and decrease selffocus in people with mild to moderate depression. Are you hunched over your phone right now, computer? How's that posture looking?"
No," Number two. Practice positive thinking. Research continues to show that your thoughts about yourself strongly affect how you feel. The best way to change any negative feelings you may have is to counteract them with a positive one. According to psychologist, Patricia Harteneck,"
No," in the Journal of Positive Psychology. A 2019 study from Canadian researchers found that merely five minutes of contact with the natural world improves mood, human health, selfesteem, and general emotional wellbeing. According to the research study, results indicated that brief nature contact"
No," Maybe that's what your parents once told you, and sometimes, they're right. According to findings from a 2011 study conducted by UCLA, oxytocin's receptor gene is linked to selfesteem and optimism. Oxytocin is often known as a cuddle hormone. So I'm sure you can guess what releases oxytocin,"
No," hugging, along with kissing, snuggling, and physical touches. Hugging is a great way to release that hormone and perhaps increase your selfesteem and optimism in the process. According to the study, life scientists identified for the first time,"
No," a particular gene's link to optimism, selfesteem, and mastery, the belief that one has control over one's own life, three critical psychological resources for coping well with stress and depression. Sounds like a good hug is sure to give a boost to your mental wellbeing."
No, Number five. Spend time with your furry friend. Got no one to hug? How about your dog? Don't have a furry friend? Now might be a good time to get one. Need to be convinced?
Environment," providing hands on petting of cats and dogs provides momentary stress relief. So, when you go on that walk in nature, make sure to bring your furry friend with you. Number six. Exercise. Exercise is not only important for our physical health,"
Environment," but our mental wellbeing as well. Regular exercise releases endorphins, which make us happy naturally. According to an article from Mayo Clinic, exercise can release feelgood endorphins, natural cannabislike brain chemicals, endogenous cannabinoids,"
No," and other natural brain chemicals that can enhance your sense wellbeing. Hm, that dog walk in nature really will pay off. Number seven. Get enough sleep. You mean they've heard adults need a good eight hours of sleep each night."
No," Well, you definitely heard right. We need a good night's rest to recharge with enough energy for the next day. Not getting your eight hours of sleep every day has been shown to negatively affect your mental health. What makes things worse is 60 to 90% of patients with depression also have insomnia"
No," according to the Sleep Health Foundation. So, people whose emotional wellbeing may already be suffering are possibly causing further health problems by not being able to get their full rest. Not only do you get grumpy and groggy from not getting enough sleep,"
No," but it's not the best for your emotional wellbeing in the long run. And number eight, keep a gratitude journal. Expressing gratitude can work wonders for our mental wellbeing. Gratitude has been linked to increased happiness, mental health, and improved wellbeing"
No," So, will you practice some of these habits? Which one will you try out first? Let us know in the comments below. If you enjoyed this video, don't forget to click the like button and share it with a friend. Subscribe to Psych2Go and hit the notification bell icon"
Environment," the country , with development should come more better paid jobs , higher disposable incomes , improvements to infrastructure , better diets and improved health , reliable electricity supplies and improved education systems . A key measure of development is Human Development"
Environment," Index or HDI . Hdi is a statistic composite index , basically a score based on life expectancy , education per capita income and standard of living . Over the past 20 years , Nigeria has achieved one the biggest HDI increases on the planet in 2005 . The nation scored not point four"
Environment," Environmental pollution in the Niger Delta certifying areas in the north and sexy fly infestations in the South must be addressed . If you want some figures to quote in your example , life expectancy in Nigeria has risen from 45 in 1990 to 53 in 2013 and infant"
Environment," Welcome to this followup video on how genetic environmental and social factors can affect human growth and development , it 's all part of btech health and social care unit , one generally covering the section b materials of the exam unit . So , let 's begin now , when it comes to this"
Environment," These are all biologically determined , so it all comes down to the genetic code of your parents . Nurture is more likely linked to the influence of external factors , so diet exercise and the conditions in which you live ."
No," and there 's not really much . We can do about it . The idea of maturation theory theories that , as we grow as we mature as we develop , any genetic health problems will develop and appear over time , whether that 's a physical health"
No," condition , a mental health condition they will . We are predetermined and preprogrammed genetically to experience . Those this leads into genetic predisposition , so conditions like cystic fibrosis , brittle bone disease , huntington 's"
Environment," now , bandura said that all our behaviors are a product of the environment in which we find ourselves . His key experiment was the bobo doll experiment where he got a clown . He uh got some children to watch a video of an actor attacking the same clown ."
No," They were then left in a room with a selection of toys and the clown , and what happened in most of the children 's cases was they imitated they recreated what they saw the actor doing on the tv . So it was a real sign that nurture"
No," is a key influence on our behavior on our actions on the way we act . Most of the . As i said , half the children were shown the footage of an adult attacking the model and many of them recreated it"
Environment," other external factors that influence our health is pollution , so this might be outdoor pollutants like traffic fumes , pesticides , industry , waste , commercial waste , building , site waste as Well , as indoor pollutants like"
Environment," cleaning chemicals aerosols cigarette smoke , it could be mold or bacteria carbon monoxide . All these pollutions affect our body in a number of ways . So physical impact might be respiratory conditions"
No," , bronchitis , asthma , emphysema , lung cancer . They could lead to cardiovascular problems , so arteries becoming blocked , heart attacks , high blood pressure , and they can also lead to allergies . So this could be wheezing rashes , allergic reactions , anaphylactic shock , so"
Environment," pollution as an external force can have a lot of physical impacts on our body and therefore our development . Finally , poor housing . Now poor housing can have a lot of impacts . So"
Environment," often it could be the cause of shortterm longterm health conditions , such as poor ventilation and damp . That could lead to mould and respiratory issues . Overcrowding could cause anxiety , depression"
Environment," , the easy spread of illness . A lack of heating could lead to hypothermia . A lack of outdoor space could mean less exercise , exercise or cardiovascular issues developing in the future"
No," , and poor sanitation increases the risk of infections . Now these issues can have a big impact on physical development because they cause physical health conditions , but they also impact on emotional and social um"
No," development . Intellectual development will all be stunted , particularly in children who do n't have access to resources or do n't have places to study . Who are unable to socialize so again , although it 's a small external environmental factor , it can"
No," The stress diaphysis model fits in between , so it suggests that individuals are more likely or predisposed potentially to develop genetic or mental health or physical health conditions ."
Environment," However , it also sits with the nurture side and suggests that actually , the likelihood of these conditions appearing is also influenced by the environment in which we find ourselves so stuff , like"
Environment," um , poor diet , alcohol consumption , um pollution . You know this could cause an underlying health condition , such as cancer , which you may be predisposed to to develop , whereas someone else who 's got the same"
Environment," predisposition , but has a better diet , does n't have as much pollution would be less likely to develop it . So it sort of sits in the middle of maturation theory and in or nurture arguments that bandora puts forward ."
No," One argument that could kind of fit with this would be um conditions like fetal alcohol syndrome , um or babies , developing health conditions because of lifestyle"
No," choices of the mother . So women who drink heavily while pregnant , have babies that are risk of fetal alcohol syndrome . Smoking during pregnancy can lead to babies having a higher chance of developing asthma and respiratory health issues . Uh"
No," drug use can lead to um , obviously risk of miscarriage , but also it can lead to health and mental health or intellectual development delays in children . Because of the the substances they 're exposed to"
No," on external influences and how these may affect us . Some of these external influences might be parenting style , so the way in which parents interact with us how they raise children can influence"
No," how their lives will be affected in the future . So , for example , dysfunctional families where there may be . You know some conflict . There could be civilian rivalry , there could be abuse"
No," , there could be poor parental influence , such as you know , drugs and alcohol . These are more likely to have an impact on the physical and intellectual and emotional development of young people . So , physically you know , abuse"
No," alcohol . Drug use . Could physically harm their bodies emotionally again , it can affect issues like selfesteem . It can affect their attachment their resilience . Their ability to cope with stress"
Environment," all would be affected by this . Intellectually . You know these problems at home would generally spill over into education , so their ability to learn to develop new skills to have successful futures would all be heavily affected by a dysfunctional"
No," family . Some of the ways the family can influence us . It 'S also parenting styles , so whether your parents are supportive or unsupportive , whether they 're , demanding or undemanding . These can"
No, affect the way in which children develop and again it often links to selfesteem selfconcept . Their ability to form relationships and attachments in the future . Bullying could also be a factor here as
No," well . So if you experience bullying as a young person that can influence and affect your ability to interact with others in the future , so bullying can cause stress anxiety . You can withdraw from activities poor selfesteem , poor selfimage"
No," can have a major impact on individuals . Finally , religion and culture . Now this is n't as extreme as some of the other areas , but again you may find dietary restrictions"
Environment," or limitations on medical intervention which could impact on health . On the other side , we have economic factors , so economic factors obviously relate to your income , your level of wealth and again this will influence your ability"
Environment," to take part in activities . It will affect your diet , your living conditions , your education , educational achievement , your opportunities for the future , so most groups who experience lowincome poverty ."
No," You know these might be lone : parents , unemployed , people , older generations , people with longterm , sickness , disabilities or families with only one wage earner . These are groups where they 're more likely to experience poverty"
No," and by experiencing poverty , paxton and dixon found that children who work in poverty underachieved academically . They were less likely to go to university , more likely to experience being victims of crime even polluted areas and also have increased risk of dying young"
Environment," when it comes to diet again , if you 're in a low income family , you are more likely to have an unhealthy diet . So often it 's cheaper food , which is highly processed high in sugars and fats . These are often cheaper than healthier options , and so , if you 're in a lowincome"
Environment," family , you may be more likely to use unhealthy food because it is cheaper and more readily available . Um again , access to health care exercise , these all be limited"
Environment," , and , lastly , employment again coming back to low income , low educational attainment . This will limit your opportunity to seek employment in the future , so this will affect your selfesteem"
No," , your selfworth , your ability to have a good home . A good diet , so employment is really important because it affects your physical development , intellectual , emotional and social ."
No," Finally , stress stress has a major impact on our physical health , mental health and emotional health . If we are stressed , then we 're more likely to experience physical health conditions like headaches . Migraines"
No," I hope this has helped thank you for watching good luck with any essays and i 'll see if you can like and subscribe . That would be really helpful for the channel . As always , thanks for watching and i 'll speak to you soon"
No," access with VIP . I'Ve got where you 're thinking it 's not about having a car , it 's about what are the things that you 're entitled to apply for and and quite usefully . I bet you do n't know about off of these items because they were quite interesting , so we 're going to"
Environment," can get on things like Housing Benefit , job seekers , allowance , income , support , working tax , credit , Employment , Support Allowance and pension credit . These are referred to as premiums and some like the ESA or pension credit are only given . If you get"
No," the PIP okay , the allowance sort of daily living allowance to find out , you could get benefit premiums . You obviously need to talk to the DWP and they may ask to see even though they know you you 've got it , they may need to see the actual benefit"
No," right of PIP , but you can find out more by contacting your local council to see what they can do for you number three on my list of things you can get when you 've got . Pip is an increased housing benefits if you receive PIP on behalf of a child who still lives at home and now"
Environment," between 16 and 20 , and in training or education , you can get help with a little bit more of Housing Benefit . Number four in my list is very obvious , but it may not become a blue badge for parking . Basically , if you get the PIP , then it will make you eligible for a blue badge"
Environment," get when you run PIP is , if you trouble by public transport you 're we 're pleased to hear that pip qualifies you And a friend for a third of most rail fares with a disabled persons , rail card , anyone with a disability can book assistance when they travel , so you could enjoy the"
Environment," discounts available for entertain and leisure activities from swimming to gyms to cinema . Many of these will ask for proof that you are disabled , yeah guy , I 'm in a wheelchair mate . I do n't really want to be the realtor , but hey I 'm disabled anyway . Can you jump it letter in in"
No," , and this This question is relating to what evidence can a person provide in support of their pip claim when they have a mental health condition ? So , as we know , uh , if you have a mental health condition uh that it has a significant impact on your"
No," daily living and maybe affects your ability to be able to work , then you may well be eligible to apply for pip . And while that sounds great in principle , it 's notoriously difficult to be able to demonstrate or get across to"
No," the pip assessors how your mental health condition affects you on a daytoday basis . Part of the difficulty with that is mental health conditions are different for everybody , even if it 's a a condition that many people have each"
No," you 're having when actually those coping mechanisms , maybe are n't working , and you have some kind of relapse or recurrence of your symptoms . That has a significant impact on you . In the case of a person with severe anxiety and depression , it might"
No," professional care agency , or they might be somebody that you employ directly equally , it could be a friend or a family member who helps you out with things have a Chat with them again in the same way and see if they 're able to write a statement about the support that they"
No, So i should not have to worry about that evidence that i 've already submitted well you 'd hope that that would be true . But actually you will find it quite beneficial if you have copies of those reports that you previously submitted or
No," or if the Way , your condition affects you has changed when they do a reassessment . So if that has n't changed , you need to make sure you communicate that it has n't . Another thing to provide information about is any upcoming assessments or treatments that"
No," you may be having through the nhs okay . So it might be that you 're , currently going through further investigations into your mental health condition or they 're looking into new kinds of treatment for you and you 've got some appointments coming up in the"
No," still waiting for those things to come through . So anything that is coming up that shows that you 're still getting treatment and that you 're still going through the nhs is really useful , and please do"
Environment, have any of your medical information at all . What the best thing to do here is get in touch with your gp and see if they can provide you with a copy of your medical records and do remember to specify the period that you
No," to be able to produce what you need before your form has to be returned . Okay , so those are some of the areas of evidence that are quite useful to you when making an application , particularly regarding mental health ."
No," Okay , it 's really important to get across to uh the personal independence payment , assessors , the uh daily living challenges that you have and the adjustments that you make going throughout the day in order to be"
No," help . You with that do bear in mind that they do have quite long waiting lists at the moment and that those waiting lists are generally speaking , compounded again by the whole covid pandemic situation , so , if you 're applying for the first time get in touch with them . First"
No," have a mental health condition and you are receiving support from an organization like mind , it may well be that your support worker is able to to help you fill that form in so do check and see . If you can get any support from somebody who 's quite knowledgeable and"
No, Hi everyone . It 'S me lindsay with equip me ot here today to talk about toileting after a back injury or back surgery . It 'S a very tricky challenge for a lot of folks and one where we see a lot of missteps that can cause problems with your healing process or just cause a lot
No," of extra pain because , as you know , when you 're healing from a back injury or back surgery , The two things you really ca n't do , a lot of is bending and twisting both which are involved in the process of going to the bathroom . So i want to go over how i 'd set up the"
Environment," important for pretty much anybody across the board - to have some sort of security frame , or at least something to hold on to when you 're backing up to sit down . One of the things you can not do during your uh transfer onto the toilet is turn to look where the seat is , so you really"
Environment," necessarily want to do all of the process of installing safety rails , you can do this , and this is actually really nice way to do it safely . Okay , so i 'm standing with my walker , as i probably would , as i approach the toilet , but instead of having the walker in"
Environment," naturally , but again , this is something that 's nice to have as a security . Let me show you how you would wrap around the toilet paper on one of these nice juvo in their instruction manual . They recommend around six squares of toilet paper ."
No," using your bathroom after you 've had a back injury or back surgery . If you 've got some value out of this video , please consider giving me a thumbs up . As always , if you need more information on how to stay safe and independent in your home and community , consider subscribing to"
No," Nearly 2/3 of Americans do not get a full eight hours of sleep . Did you hear that now one researcher is sounding the alarm about what he calls a silent sleep loss epidemic . He has scientists , Matthew Walker , he 's"
No, devoted more than 20 years to studying sleep and his impact on health and disease . So he knows what he 's talking about . He teaches neuroscience and psychology at the University of California Berkeley he 's published more than a hundred
Environment," scientific studies . Walker 'S new book is why we sleep unlocking the power of sleep and dreams . He says sleep . Deprivation has a catastrophic impact on our health work , productivity and children 's education . The book is published by Scribner and imprint of"
No," killing us in developed nations from cancer , Alzheimer 's , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , stroke , even suicide . They all have significant and causal links to insufficient sleep . And if you look at the epidemiological data , it 's quite clear to short : sleep equals a"

No," bad and the ugly tell us why well , firstly , sleeping pills : do not produce naturalistic sleep . I wish they did , but at this stage they do n't there are class of drugs that we call the sedative hypnotics and sedation is not sleep , so you 're simply removing"
No," consciousness you 're , not producing that realistic sleep . The second aspect is that they 've been related to a higher risk of mortality of death and a higher risk of cancer too , so just make sure we get to this . So what do you do to make sure you get as much sleep as you should ?"
No," you do n't need them all limit screen time that will allow . Is that sort of melatonin hormone to build up and get you to sleep ? Keep cool degrees 65 to 67 ? It 'S strange , I 'm turning it down ! Yeah I 've been doing that . Yeah but your body needs to drop"
No," its temperature to get to sleep and you can help it to do that . That 'S the third thing , temperature , the fourth is actually walk . It out , do n't stay in bed if you 've been awake , because then at that point your brain learns . The association between your bedroom being about being"
No," light , dim light , read a book only return when you 're sleepy and then you 'll relearn , the association between your bed equaling sleepiness . Finally , and it makes me deeply unpopular um no caffeine after 2:00 pm and no nightcap alcohol is probably one of the most misunderstood"
No," chemicals . It 'S also a sedative you 're , just knocking yourself out , it 's not naturalistic sleep , and it also fragments your sleep . You wake up many more times throughout the night and it also blocks your dream sleep . So you know imagine food food . The advice right now is do n't"
No, go to bed too . Full do n't go to bed too hungry . Thank you . Thank you . Matt sleep cures . A lot of things why we sleep is on sale now
No," JACQUELINE HOWARD: Good afternoon, everyone. I'm CNN health reporter, Jacqueline Howard. And I'm here to welcome you to our panel discussion on sleep. As we all know, sleep plays a vital role in our health. But many of us aren't getting enough of it, myself included. And so lack of sleep can put our physical and mental health at risk."
No," And that's why today, our group of experts will help us understand what's preventing many of us from a good night's rest. And they'll share their advice on how to improve your quality of sleep. Joining me today, some of the nation's leading experts on sleep and medicine."
No," at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Welcome, panelists. And now let's begin by exploring first, the connection between sleep and physical health. According to the CDC, adults who get less than seven hours of sleep a night are at higher risk for heart attack, asthma, and depression."
No," Dr. Seixas, I'm curious. You've done a lot of research about sleep and specifically cardiovascular disease. So can you tell us what's the connection between sleep and illness, including some of those chronic diseases that I mentioned? AZIZI SEIXAS: Well, thank you so much for having me."
No," Before we delve into looking at that linkage, I think we need to have pretty good understanding of what we mean by sleep health. Sleep health really consists of a wide variety of different things, such as the quality of your sleep, particularly looking at sleepiness, and your level of alertness, and timing, efficiency,"
Environment," whether or not if someone has a sleep disorder, looking at the architecture in terms of the different stages, as well as sleep duration. And in many ways, sleep has significant value, value in terms of helping with significant physiological processes, like homeostasis, which is keeping the biological environment quite equal"
No," and conserving energy, as well as brain functioning. And when you look at all of those functions, as well as the different areas or different ways in which we can look at sleep, not just focusing on duration, there has been a bevy of several studies that have shown that sleep in many ways is associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease,"
No," diabetes, mental health, brain health, looking at Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and Parkinson, immune function, as well as autoimmune function, respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD, cancer, cognitive function and performance, such as attention and memory, falls as well. Increased risk for falls, individuals"
No," who don't get adequate sleep. As well as it can significantly impede kids getting significant or obtaining and achieving developmental milestones. It's been linked with increased risk for accidents and injuries, increased risk for obesity, as well as a wide variety of different cardiometabolic risk"
No," factors, like insulin sensitivity and blood pressure and the like, bone health, quality of life, work productivity, physical activity, as well as sedentary behavior. And the perfunctory question you may ask is, how is it that sleep has such a global effect on us? And my response really would be that in many ways,"
No," sleep is so important to us that it may lead to acute and longterm biological system failure and deterioration, which is why I say that sleep in many ways is fundamental and primordial, meaning everything emanates from it. JACQUELINE HOWARD: And if we turn our attention specifically"
No," to cardiovascular disease, I am curious, Dr. Alcantara, you've looked at racial disparities in sleep and cardiovascular health risks. Can you tell us more about what you've learned and specifically, how sleep can play a role in elevating rates of chronic disease in Black and Brown communities?"
No," is that related to sleep health disparities or sleep disparities. And what we know from the literature from sort of evaluating the evidence is that when you look in the aggregate at the population level, we see that racial ethnic minorities compared to nonLatinx white adults and individuals,"
No," we see that poor people compared to those with higher socioeconomic status, they tend to be at higher risk to experience some of the sleep problems and sleep disturbances along those dimensions that Dr. Seixas had talked about earlier. So there is consistent evidence, and for some of these dimensions more so than others,"
No," in particular for sleeping less than the recommended number hours of sleep that Black and Brown people or people of color are disproportionately at risk to experience those conditions. So that's one important, I think, piece of information is that there is literature already established that those exist. When we then look at the linkages between disparities"
No," and even some of the health conditions that were mentioned earlier, which have also been shown to be pretty persistent and pervasive, we found that sleep in some studies including one that our group here at Columbia had done, where it was adults who came to the hospital after suffering from a heart attack,"
No," We also tracked their sleep for a month after their discharge. And what we found is that specifically for Black adults who slept less than seven hours on average in that month after being discharged from the hospital, they were the only group who were at higher risk of experiencing another major adverse cardiovascular event."
No," here and sleeping less than seven hours of sleep that puts you at this elevated risk of having another cardiovascular event. And so there's I think a lot more research to be done, including more mechanistic research to really try to understand the specific ways in which sleep places Black identified adults at acute risk"
No," for another major cardiovascular event. But we do have established research both to support sleep health disparities along racial ethnic lines and then also, that sleep may be an important some might even say mediator in trying to understand the role of racial ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease."
No," JACQUELINE HOWARD: So Dr. Alcantara, as we think about sleep as a mediator, as you said, or quality of sleep as a social determinant of health, can you break down, what are specifically the environmental and social factors that contribute to poor sleep and how they disproportionately affect Black and Brown communities?"
No," And then a follow up to that would be, how can we then make sure sleep interventions are culturally appropriate? CARMELA ALCANTARA: This is I want to say the million dollar question or two. But I love your question because it really shifts the focus from the individual and focusing on individual level factors"
No," your risk for sleep problems. And so we know, for example, that marginalized communities, racial ethnic minorities are more likely to live in neighborhoods with socioeconomic disadvantage. And so that can include neighborhoods that might have higher policing, neighborhoods"
Environment," that then have greater exposure to noise pollution, greater exposure to light pollution, and all these factors, which we know that impact in the short term sleep, and then can have these cascading long term effects on sleep as well and health as well. So I think it really is about thinking about broadening"
No," the lens beyond just the individual to really those macro environmental level factors. And something that's really important when I often talk about this work and really try to make a convincing case for why there are these racial, ethnic disparities in sleep is to make sure to clarify that what I'm not implying"
No," is that there are genetic differences that are contributing to who's at risk of having sleep problems and how that may differ by race, but really where we have to look at just what you said, those social and environmental factors that place people in neighborhoods that might have more exposures to the kinds of factors that increase"
Environment," their risk of sleep, like I mentioned before, noise pollution, light pollution, et cetera, access to treatment, and whatnot. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, yeah, those environmental and social factors. I'd like to also kind of turn our focus to looking at sleep and your brain."
No," And we know that sleep plays an important role in our memory, particularly in children and teens. So Dr. Spencer, how important is sleep for young people? And how can lack of sleep early on in life affect us in the long run? REBECCA SPENCER: Yeah, so I'll start by saying that the whole role of sleep in memory"
No," is really something that I think is important to think about. And the way I like to put it is when you sleep, you're taking this movie of your day. And you're putting it on replay. And it's this great mnemonic device. It's a way to really solidify the memories that we form during our day."
No," And so if you think that during development you're learning so much and you're processing so much, and some of those things are these emotional things that happen to us that we can then filter out and decide what to spend more time thinking about. And that's really a critical function of sleep for all ages. But when we're young and we're learning a lot,"
No," that's when some of those functions might be most important. And when you're really young, if you miss a sleep out so we can look, for instance, I'm preschoolers. And they are regular nappers. And if a habitually napping child misses their nap for one reason or another, they're"
No," going to forget up to 18% of what they learned in the morning versus if they take that nap, those memories are protected. So that's this really significant difference that sleep can make and why it's so important for learning at such a young age. And it's also important to think that lack of sleep"
No," and possibly things that build up into psychopathologies as they grow up. I mean, the other thing that I think is really important to think about with sleep and young kids is this is the time when they're really learning sleep habits. And so a good sleeping child grows up"
No," into a good sleeping adolescent, grows up to being a good sleeping adult. And so lack of sleep as a child is also building up poor sleep habits that can really stick with them. JACQUELINE HOWARD: You talked a lot about the importance of napping just then. And is there an age when you would recommend a child stops"
No," napping? When do we stop our naps? REBECCA SPENCER: Yeah, well, as adults we would all love to keep napping. And the upside is napping is good for everybody. So if you do take a nap, naps are going to be functional. And naps are going to do something good for your memory"
No," no matter what age you're at. It's just how bad is it to not nap that changes. And so when you look at these little ones, when naps seem to be so essential, that's when they really need them because their brains are so small. They're also learning a ton."
No," So if you think you've got tons of information coming in, you've also got a very little palate to put them on, you have to unload that information more frequently. And so that's what's happening in development and why they have this really huge sleep need. But it needs to be distributed. So they learn a little, they pack it away,"
No," need to have some napping in the middle of the day in order to carry it on and not lose memories. After that point, again, naps can still be beneficial. They're just not as essential as they are for those young ones. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, and at any age, we experience the most significant effects of lack of sleep when we're jet lagged, for instance,"
Environment," want to be up in the middle of the night to study what happens to people in the middle of the night. And yet, there are millions of people awake in the middle of the night either because they have to, because they have a job in security, or transportation, or medicine, or clinical care, or because they don't want to because they have insomnia or they have pain."
No," There is not a lot of direct evidence about what happens. Many studies of sleep deprivation actually ask what happens in the morning rather than in the middle of the night. However, we do know that the brain operates differently in some ways because there tends to be more risky behaviors in the middle of the night."
No," There's more suicides in the middle of the night relative to the amount of people that are awake. There's more sort of rumination. If you're awake, you have these feelings that you have problems sort of breaking out of patterns of thinking. There's some evidence that people"
No," take more risky behaviors, that they are less likely to process things the same way as they do when they're awake during the day. And so I am hoping and trying very hard that a lot of researchers will increase sleep studies of people's wake functioning at night because there are so many people at night."
No," And if they're awake at night, how do they operate at night? And also, how do they then operate during the day? JACQUELINE HOWARD: That is an interesting area of research to watch specifically. And also, when you think about as we age, it can be harder to get a good night's sleep. And you might have some disruptions in sleep"
No," during the night. And we know that sleep impacts our memory. But what about neurological conditions as well, like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's? How could getting better sleep help treat or even prevent these diseases? Dr. Seixas, I'll turn that to you."
No," AZIZI SEIXAS: Sure. So there has been mounting evidence globally that shows that individuals who don't get sufficient sleep and my good colleague, my friend, Dr. Alcantara, had shared one of the things that we can't do is that if you get less than seven hours of sleep, that you're"
No," at an increased risk for dementia, Alzheimer's disease, as well as Parkinsonian conditions and symptoms as well. So I just want to ensure that I provide some context and understanding to your audience as to what might be going on. Why is it that sleep is so important for"
No, these neurological conditions? And I would highlight I think four ways in which I'm going to use them as metaphors as to how sleep operates. Sleep can act as a catalyst or a trigger. Or it could act as a cleaner or a protector or as a defragmentation tool.
No," So let me take the first one, as a catalyst or as a trigger. What happens during sleep? And when you don't get sufficient sleep is that it can trigger what I call epigenetic processes, where you can increase cognitive decline and dementia. What does it mean?"
No," It means, therefore, that if an individual who has a genetic predisposition for neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's and dementia, that not getting sufficient sleep may actually trigger that epigenetic process, that biological mechanism that may accelerate the development of such disease, particularly dementia."
No," Let's focus on sleep as a cleaner. There's been more evidence showing that sleep is really critical as a cleaner, almost like a vacuum system whereby over the given day that your neurons, which are your brain cells, may produce what we call beta amyloid. These are protein debris particularly"
No," in the brain region. And when you sleep, many of these neurons actually shrink. And it allows the brain to wash and to clean itself. And so that is many ways how sleep can help to clean the brain of these very potential toxic proteins that are linked with Alzheimer's disease and dementia."
No," Let's look at sleep as a protector. One of the things that we do know is that outside of Alzheimer's disease, that vascular dementia is a highly prevalent form of dementia. And this is primarily driven by cardiometabolic risks, such as elevated blood pressure, as well"
No," Sleep is critical in the sense that it helps to protect the brain from having these types of lesions, where sleep can help to reduce blood pressure. Sleep in many ways is connected to blood pressure dipping, which is something that we oftentimes see everyone goes through that. And sleep helps to protect us from these vascular risks that"
No," can cause vascular dementia. And the last area, sleep works like a defragmentation. I don't know if anyone still does this with their computers. But the more we pile on ourselves each day, that sleep in many ways helps to consolidate all the different cognitive functionings, all the experiences that we have."
No," And in many ways, sleep can help to recenter in many ways the brain whereby it can reduce cognitive load, reduce brain fog. And therefore, it can increase cognitive speed and processing. So those are the four ways in which sleep in many ways impacts risk for dementia, as well as cognitive function. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, and when"
No," we think about those health benefits of sleep, the way that you broke that down, Dr. Seixas, I think that we should also talk about, well, how can we improve our sleep? How can we really get the most benefit from it? And I know that some people out there might consider themselves early birds, others night owls."
No," But what role exactly does our natural circadian rhythm play in sleep cycles? And while being an early bird is often beneficial in the way that we function in society and the way schools are typically structured, are there other benefits to being an early riser? Dr. Spencer, I'm curious what you think."
Environment," REBECCA SPENCER: Yeah, I mean, I think that being an early riser certainly aligns us with a lot of the expectations of the world, like you pointed to with schools. But being a professor and even in a college environment, we see that a lot of things start early. And you look at what time business is open. And you look at what time meetings are scheduled."
No," And for us in the Northeast, if we have sun to help us wake up in the morning, that's going to be beneficial no matter what chronotype you have. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, yeah. And there's also a lot of mental health interventions that expand into the digital space that actually help"
No," with promoting quality sleep. Dr. Alcantara, is there a role for these types of apps and other digital technology in helping people get a better rest? CARMELA ALCANTARA: Yeah, thanks for that question, Jacqueline. I think something to note is that there's been a proliferation of apps I think targeting sleep problems"
No," and also a proliferation of research, testing whether these apps or digital technologies or digital treatments improve sleep. The best evidence that we have right now are for digital. And that can be online treatments or appbased treatments for the treatment of insomnia and specifically a type of psychological treatment"
No," called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is the gold standard first line of defense for the treatment of insomnia. There's been lots of studies to show that delivered via an app or online actually is as effective in reducing insomnia symptoms in the short term and the long term"
Environment," than sort of a similar type of education or psychoeducationbased program. So there's a lot of reason, I think, to be excited about the potential for these digital technologies to help people improve their sleep. I often think about sleep as a social justice issue."
No," And in thinking about sleep as a social justice issue and considering equity issues in terms of who has access to treatments and who doesn't, I think with these digital therapeutics we have to think about, well, who was a part of the studies that informed the evidence? Who's missing from those studies?"
No," And what we know is that a lot of these treatments have been developed with highlyeducate populations, predominantly whiteidentified individuals mostly English speaking. And what that means is there's a lot of gaps in terms of understanding under what conditions and for whom do these types of digital technologies,"
No," digital treatments work? And in the area of mental health care, as I mentioned, cognitive behavioral therapy is the first line of treatment for insomnia. So if you have insomnia, the recommendation is find yourself a behavioral healthcare provider who's trained in that."
No, But what we know is that there's a major supply and demand issue. Demand for qualified providers is high. But the supply is quite low. And so you can see that being really magnified when you think about nonEnglishspeaking communities.
No," And so digital therapeutics, I think part of why I'm excited about that and pursuing some of these studies where we're testing taking an evidencebased treatment like this, adapting it, then testing it using rigorous methods, and seeing if it's effective is because we're never going to have"
No," enough trained behavioral healthcare providers who speak Spanish. And so we have to think about, for example, how can we leverage some of these digital technologies, digital therapeutics to address this mental healthcare need, particularly if we think that everyone should sleep well? If we think about it as a sleep health"
No," as a social justice issue then it becomes an imperative to really think about, how can we design interventions with an equity focus to try to ensure access I think from the beginning? So there's a lot of excitement, a lot of I think promise, a lot more research to be done. But what's really important is centering equity"
No," in that kind of research and that kind of implementation. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, yeah, like you said, everyone should sleep well. And Dr. Korman, for times when we might not get the recommended amount of sleep, can we make up for lost sleep during the week with longer periods of sleep on the weekends or by napping?"
No," Is there any way to make up for the sleep that we might lose? ELIZABETH KORMAN: Yes, nap. I totally agree. Sleep in on weekends and nap. And related to your question about morning people versus evening people, evening people, evening prototypes are people who want to go to sleep later"
No," and wake up later. And as you noted, they can't get as much sleep as they want during the week because they have usually social obligations. And so they will want to sleep in on weekends. And we say if you can't sleep, you should sleep. There's no evidence that you can oversleep."
No," I saw that one of the questions was, can you oversleep? Unlike chocolate cake or eating, when you can eat when you're not hungry, there is no evidence that you could sleep when you're not tired. You might feel a little groggy when you wake up. And that's because your brain is waking up."
No," But if you want to sleep and it's a safe place for you to sleep, please give yourself a chance to sleep. JACQUELINE HOWARD: And Dr. Korman, a follow up for you. Plus I'll make this a lightning round. So everyone jump in after Dr. Korman. But in just a few sentences, what's"
Environment," your best advice for someone trying to improve their sleep just in general? ELIZABETH KORMAN: So in general, if you're in a safe place to sleep and you can, give yourself time to sleep. There are what are called sleep education or sleep hygiene, where you don't watch a horror movie before you go to sleep. You relax."
No, And you try and go to sleep. Don't have caffeine too late. There are a number of things. But most people don't give themselves enough time to sleep. And hopefully that's not because they have family or work obligations.
No," They're working two to three jobs and they don't. But even for people who don't have those other obligations, they just don't give themselves enough time. And so I say, as the other panelists have said, it's vitally important that you give yourself time to sleep, allow your body to sleep. Sorry about that."
No," REBECCA SPENCER: If I can jump in. I think this is the lightning round portion. If I can jump in, Jacqueline. I think something when I talk to community members about sleep and often these are communities who are working multiple jobs or who are commuting. I'm here based in New York City."
No," And commuting is a normal sort of course of life. And so one of the biggest, I think, or important tips I try to emphasize is just the importance of a bedtime routine. Oftentimes people know this. It's intuitive when thinking about children and helping children establish a bedtime routine."
No," But somewhere along the way, that, I think, practice becomes less common as people enter into adulthood. And so trying to, I think, remind people that sort of our body and our brain needs those cues to help us be at an optimal place to get if we create opportunities to sleep to get good sleep and high quality sleep."
No," So I that's one of the recommendations is reminding people remember what you would do for your if you have children or if you are caretakers of younger kids to help them establish a routine, now think about doing that for yourself as well. CARMELA ALCANTARA: Yeah, I can go next."
Environment," I really like to think of controlling the controllables. So making sure that you have access to light during the day and exposing yourself to light during the day, particularly outside natural light, but then keeping your environment dark at night. And sometimes you don't have a lot of control over the light. So maybe you want to wear an eye mask."
Environment, Maybe you don't have a lot of control over the temperature of your room. But maybe you can open a window. Maybe you don't have a lot of control over sounds in your environment. But maybe you can use a white noise app. So trying to think of ways that you can make that sleep
Environment," environment as comfortable as possible and sleep promoting as possible. And a lot of those things that I mentioned are also portable. So if you find yourself traveling a lot, you can bring the eye mask, and the app, and things with you to help you have a consistent and controlled, comfortable sleep environment."
No," sleep disorders that may interfere with people's ability to sleep. And if you are tired after being in bed for around eight hours or your bed partner says that you snore, or you stop breathing, or you are really kicking and active in your sleep, you should consult a doctor because there may be sleep disorders"
No," that we can treat that will help you sleep better. So I'm sorry. AZIZI SEIXAS: No, that's totally fine. You chose the one that I was going to say. I'm just joking. I'm just joking. I'm just trying to bring some levity."
No, that we can share with folks. And I hope people are hearing this. Two things. One is I oftentimes say start your day with sleep. I know it sounds weird because people usually sleep at night. But here is how I oftentimes break it down. Let's say you have a busy day ahead tomorrow.
No," And you know that the sleep is going to be your fuel so that you can perform at your optimal best. Therefore you must be able to treat your day, meaning the night before, as if it were the beginning of your day because if you have a tough day ahead and all of us have busy schedules and lead very socially demanding lives"
No," that you must start your day with sleep. So therefore, sleep is not seen as something that is shortchanged because oftentimes, we see sleep as a nuisance. It gets in the way of us getting and being productive. So I think start your day with sleep. And the second thing is you must see sleep"
No," as an investment whereby the more you can invest in your health, more you can invest in career and all of those things. Sleep in many ways can be that super thing that can allow you to really allow you to maximize your day. So two things, start your day with sleep"
No," and see sleep as an investment. ELIZABETH KORMAN: Jacqueline, may I add one more to this great list? And I think everyone here would approve. There's been a lot of really great research I want to say in the past decade or recently to emphasize the importance of sleep regularity."
No," And so making sure that you're waking up at the same time every day, regardless of weekday or weekend, and then that you're going to bed at the same time, and then that you're waking up at the same time. And that in some ways it can be very counterintuitive because you want to sort of sleep in. You want to catch up on sleep."
No," But what we know from research is that kind of sleep regularity is really important in terms of promoting good health outcomes. So I just wanted to add to that. CARMELA ALCANTARA: Actually, I'm going to slightly disagree. I'm going to say it depends on how much sleep you get during the week."
No," If you really haven't gotten enough sleep during the week, then I would say you should sleep in on weekends to catch up on sleep. But if you're getting four or five hours of sleep at night during the week, then you need the extra sleep. But otherwise, if you are approximately getting the right amount of sleep,"
No," I totally agree that sleep regularity is very important. It's just that if you're not getting enough sleep, the overwhelming disadvantages of insufficient sleep, I think, my professional opinion override the disadvantages of having irregular sleep. So they're both important. They're just slightly complicated message."
No," Thank you for that. And thank you for that clarification. And I think we've covered a lot when it comes to sleep and health. But I also want to shift the discussion to sleep and policy. And in recent years, there's been a lot of debate surrounding school start"
Environment," times and the education policies there. We know that the state of California now requires middle schools start no earlier than 8:00 AM, high schools no earlier than 8:30 AM. Is this something more schools should consider? Dr. Korman and Dr. Spencer, any thoughts on this."
Environment," So even though on average those little kids can handle an earlier start better, we know there's a lot of cases, particularly kids that come from low income households, that their sleep is going to be compromised with an earlier start time. So for instance, those kids that live in low income households"
No, are more likely to have parents that shift work. They have scheduling things that keep them out later. So now you're going to have a really young kid with an overall shorter sleep out at night. And that has a lot of negative repercussions. So there are things like that we're going to need to be mindful of as this shift continues.
No," framework to research on sleep and sleeprelated health problems. When we think about sleep and policy, can you share more about what do policymakers need to know about this framework? AZIZI SEIXAS: Sure. Thank you so much again for the opportunity to discuss this."
No," It's something that we've created here at the University of Miami School of Medicine, particularly in our Center for Translational Sleep and Circadian Sciences. And here's what we said. We're saying that in order for us to provide policymakers and the entire ecosystem,"
No," and this includes parents, and patients, and the community, and the public, and providers, and payers, and everyone. A way in which we can create, I think, paradigmatic changes into how we roll out policy is by making our research and our evidence more robust. And so what we've proposed is, how is it that we can capture different types of data?"
No," And I think some of my esteemed colleagues have already started discussing the importance of data. But what we've done thus far is that we've laid out exactly the types of data that are needed to be able to take a 360degree perspective to understand sleep. If you want to take a 360degree perspective,"
Environment," And once you've been able to capture all those data, let's say school start time, let's say shift work, let's say the impact that sleep has on health outcomes. Now, once you capture that 360degree perspective, looking at the person's biology, looking at their behaviors, looking at their social context and social environment, looking at environmental factors,"
No," then you need to be able to lay out a really robust analytical plan as to how we can capture that. And what we've been able to demonstrate and I think some of us have already alluded to but we'll be a little bit more direct, that when you look at advanced types of analyzes, you can see sleep as an omniphenomenon."
No," I know we were talking about sleep as a predictor of many health outcomes and potentially a consequence. But we see sleep as an omniphenomenon, meaning that it's a predictor. It's a correlate. It's an artifact."
No," It's a consequence of many different health outcomes. It's sleep and dot, dot, dot. And so when you understand that, then it allows you to translate those analyzes on a continuum, what we call discovery, from description all the way to optimization. And once you understand, what are causes, what"
No," are the causes of disease, what are the drivers of treatments, and why some treatments work for whom across different contexts, then we are able to then look at, how is it that we can make our translation on our healthcare delivery more seamless from awareness then to avoidance, then increasing access, increasing assessments? We know that if you go to your primary care provider,"
No," they don't really ask about sleep. But when we collect those data, what are those providers going to do? Are we going to triage individuals and provide care? We need to be able to find ways of how to do that. It will also allow us to increase, how is it that we can improve acceptance to treatments as well"
No," as adherence? And so what is translational approach in terms of precision, personalized, population health, which is, how is it that we can study the community or the population to inform the individual in terms of particular treatments? It could be personalized treatments. But how can the evidence from that"
No," funnel back into the community for us to understand which treatments work for whom, at what time, at what dosage, across which contexts? And in many ways, I think that's what policymakers want. They want more robust, comprehensive data that will allow them to get to the root of understanding the insights in many ways, from description to optimization."
No," And then they want data, good data that will allow us to increase the healthcare delivery. And that's the value chain that we're trying to do. And I think this is something that policymakers and all of us need to really look into as we try and make sleep health for all. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, I can only"
No," imagine all of the questions left to answer and that we could answer if we do get that population data when it comes to sleep and health. That's a very, very important message there, Dr. Seixas. Thank you for that. Another topic when it comes to policy here, we know that very soon we'll be turning the clocks ahead"
No," for daylight saving time. And last March, the Senate voted unanimously in favor of the Sunshine Protection Act, which would make daylight saving time permanent, year round. Question for everyone, but I'll start with Dr. Korman. How would that impact people's sleep cycles?"
No," And are you in favor of permanent daylight saving? ELIZABETH KORMAN: So not only am I against permanent daylight saving, virtually every scientific community is against permanent daylight saving and for permanent Standard Time. And the Sunshine Protection Act does not protect sunshine. The amount of sunshine is the same,"
No," and didn't request any information and voted unanimously. So the scientific community is a little confused about what kind of science can we do? How can we transform our science into policy? As Azizi just said, what is needed? What we do know is that being in standard daylight saving time"
No," of insufficient sleep that my esteemed colleagues have mentioned earlier. And also, it will totally reverse the later school start times issue because you're now switching the clocks earlier again instead of switching the clocks later. So the science is for that we should not switch to daylight saving time."
Environment," REBECCA SPENCER: Yeah, I'll just add from a developmental perspective that we know that if we were to switch to permanent daylight savings time that poses some safety risk for kids even just going to school in the dark in the morning. So there's one thing about waking them up. There's another thing about keeping them safe"
No," And so it's going to be really important to push back on this decision. ELIZABETH KORMAN: So speaking of learning from the past, the United States has had permanent daylight saving time twice in the past, once in the 1915s, I think, and once in the 1970s with the energy policy. And both times it was turned back."
No," It was repealed because it was so unpopular. So I'm not sure why we want to do it again. Also, the UK and Russia also at one point instituted the equivalent of permanent daylight saving time. And they were also reversed because they were so unpopular. So learning from the past, I would argue that's another reason not to do it again."
No," CARMELA ALCANTARA: I just want to contribute something on this point of policies and relate it to social determinants and the need really also for policies that address some issues related to social determinants, of policies that address structural racism that really has affected which communities have been exposed to and live in communities that are more socioeconomically"
No," disadvantaged or neighborhoods based on those beliefs, and systems, and policies that racial ethnic minoritised communities, in particular Black communities were perceived as less than and needing to by white identified individuals in positions of power and structures to sort of perpetuate this system and the status quo. So I think it's important in any kind of policy conversation"
No," to remember that there's also policies that we can advocate for policies to improve neighborhoods, to improve communities, to address issues of structural racism and healthcare, structural racism and housing policies, practices, neighborhoods that in turn would actually have these, I think, downstream effects on behaviors like sleep."
No," So just wanted to make sure we included that in our conversation of policy. JACQUELINE HOWARD: And Dr. Alcantara, when we consider that in Black and Brown communities we do see a disproportionate impact of sleep loss and sleep quality. So as we talk about daylight saving time and having this policy debate, I'm fascinated by the idea"
No," that falling back, springing forward during daylight saving time can have a subsequent disproportionate impact on Black and Brown communities because of the already preexisting disparities we see in sleep there. I'm curious your thoughts on that as well. CARMELA ALCANTARA: I think you just articulated it beautifully."
No, And I feel like there's so much that needs to be involved in terms of stakeholder involvement and even thinking about public health messaging because there's a disconnect. We have great science. And yet there's a disconnect with what policymakers are hearing.
No," What the public is hearing are I think forgetting of history, as Dr. Korman mentioned. So I think really it seems like it's rife for some research targeted around public campaigning, messaging to really promote the science that we know. And I think the concern about disproportionate impact in Black and Brown communities, like you mentioned,"
No," of policies like the ones we were just talking about. ELIZABETH KORMAN: So I totally agree that there's a lot to be learned about how to take science and make it into policy. And I think we can learn from experience with cigarette smoking in public and from other health campaigns, like cigarette smoking public, seatbelt use,"
Environment," drunk driving, where it was a combination of science, public policy, public education, advocacy. And so I think all of them are going to be important in trying to address the daylight saving time issue, as well as other things related to structural and racial inequalities that we need science."
Environment, But we also need communication. We need education. We need advocacy. We can do this. We have done this with cigarette smoking and wearing a seatbelt. It takes a lot more than just knowing the science. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Thank you for that.
No," And as we approach our final 10 minutes, we do have some audience questions for the panel. So I'll start with the first question here. Are there any effects of sleep deprivation that are irreversible? I know we talked about ways to improve sleep. But are there any effects that sadly are irreversible,"
No," Dr. Korman? ELIZABETH KORMAN: If you have an accident because you're sleep deprived, that would be irreversible. Are you talking about let's ensure about this. So in terms of short term versus long term, if you didn't get enough sleep for one or two nights,"
No," there's fairly good evidence that you're fine if you get the sleep on weekends or something like that. Over long term, as has been mentioned, there's effects on memory. There's effects on your risk of dementia. There's effects on many things."
No," So short term I think it's fairly well known that you can make up a couple of nights of insufficient sleep hopefully on the weekend or on a vacation. But long term there are these cumulative effects that my colleagues have mentioned. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, I think we did talk about, as you mentioned,"
No," the increased risk for various chronic diseases that would help answer that question of irreversible effects. And when we think about making up sleep loss, there is a question here from the audience. Are four twohour sleep increments as good as eight consecutive hours? I'm curious what the panel thinks about that."
No," ELIZABETH KORMAN: No. Well, first of all, if you can only sleep in four twohour increments, then you should sleep. But the sleep is different at night versus during the day. And some types of sleep sort of have to cycle through. You have to have what's called nonREM sleep before you"
No," can have the REM sleep. And that takes a while. And so if you keep on stopping it, you're not going to get to all the different stages of sleep that you need. That's my JACQUELINE HOWARD: So you need those consecutive hours"
No," for the benefits. ELIZABETH KORMAN: Right. AZIZI SEIXAS: Yeah, I'll just add I think, not to speak for Dr. Alcantara, I think that's what she was trying to allude to earlier about having a consistent routine. It's consistent routine of consolidated sleep."
No," And what we've shown and what the research has shown is that overwhelmingly people who actually have a consolidated routine, meaning sleeping throughout a particular period, those individuals seem to get the best health benefits from sleep. And I'm trying to understand the kernel of the question"
No," because I know oftentimes people try and ask us ways in which they can perhaps circumnavigate, not actually getting sleep. And that's the enigma of sleep. And in many ways, there is a movement afoot where people are trying to create innovative solutions around sleep hacking."
No," And that's where the data is still nascent, where we still don't know enough information about how is it that we can try these alternative modalities on treatment, where we can try and optimize sleep, whatever that means for that particular individual? And that's where we have to be very careful about that. What the overwhelming evidence does"
No, say is routine consolidated sleep overwhelmingly protects people from adverse health consequences and improves performance and a whole host of other positive health outcomes. REBECCA SPENCER: I'll just add too. Sorry. So sleep fragmentation is what that essentially is.
No," And a lot of middle aged and older adults could speak from experience about that, right? There's not just sleep time going down as we get older. But you see increased sleep fragmentation in our older adult populations. And I can tell you from working with a lot of older adults that they'll say that from their experience,"
No," that if they even have it might be a shorter night of sleep but hey, I slept the entire time, they'll feel so much better. And we can look at that. We've shown in our memory studies that it's not just you need one sleep stage, so slow wave sleep."
No," And unfortunately, that might be some of what's going on when we see disruption in sleep and worsening cognition in our older populations. Those two things might go hand in hand. AZIZI SEIXAS: Yeah, I'll just end with this if that's OK. So I agree wholeheartedly. I think the question is if we add those hours together,"
No, it's still eight hours and the like. But it doesn't equal to good quality. And people need to be aware of that. Not all sleep are equal. And so I just want to end with that. ELIZABETH KORMAN: Yes. JACQUELINE HOWARD: And some people
No," have to sleep hack, so to speak, because they work the overnight shift. Might be a single mother. Someone might have three jobs. I mean, there's so many various we talked about social determinants of health, so many various environmental and social factors,"
No," on the health of those who do spend years having to sleep in increments or sleep hack because they work multiple jobs, because they work overnight, compared with those who do spend years getting consecutive eight hours each night? Do we know anything about the health impacts of being chronically sleep deprived?"
No," because it's really a central focus of my research and personal because a lot of the women in my family are nurses and are shift workers and work at night. And I have seen the negative impact that it has had on them. What the research has borne out is that it increases what we call metabolic syndrome, where you can have a wide variety of different risks"
No," And so what we need to do, I hope, is that we have to have a serious policy discussion around individuals who are shift workers. What do we do? What we have done in our group is we said we oftentimes look at individuals who are single moms."
No," And we say, if you can't get seven hours and you can only get six, what are some areas that you can shift? So we use machine learning and artificial intelligence to come up with different profiles that can provide more personalized recommendations to individuals, where if you can only get six hours of sleep,"
No," well, how much physical activity should you engage in in order to lower your risk? What kinds of foods do you need to eat in order to lower your risk, if you can't get that? And we've been able to find different profiles and different recommendations of people who may get six hours of sleep, but can make"
No," certain alterations in their lives and lifestyles to balance out their risk for cardiometabolic health conditions. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Yeah, and while we have two minutes left, my final question, if someone can answer this very quickly. An audience member wants to know more about sleep apnea, when to get tested."
No," What are some potential therapies that can help? Can anyone speak to that sleep apnea? AZIZI SEIXAS: I think I can speak to that because that's my area as well. So in terms of excessive loud snoring, if someone loses oxygen or feels as if they're tired when they wake up, so those"
No," to see a sleep specialist for that. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Great. And with one minute left, I'll start with Dr. Alcantara, can you each give one last brief advice for the audience, lightning round? CARMELA ALCANTARA: Oh boy, I think Dr. Spencer mentioned this already."
No," But I think getting exposure to bright light in the morning is just really important. And I think something that gets under estimated. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Dr. Korman? ELIZABETH KORMAN: Recognize the importance of sleep. As one of the founders of the field said, if sleep doesn't serve a vital function,"
No," it's the worst mistake evolution ever made. So recognize that you need to sleep for so many aspects of mental and physical health. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Dr. Spencer? REBECCA SPENCER: Yeah, I would add exercising is something that you can do to, if nothing else, it can clear your mind."
No," And really that's part of the rumination problem, where a lot of people have as they're trying to fall asleep. But we think it does some other things in terms of helping you sleep more soundly as well. So getting out, getting physically active will really help you sleep better at night. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Dr. Seixas?"
No," AZIZI SEIXAS: Said it before. Start your day with sleep and see sleep as an investment. JACQUELINE HOWARD: Wonderful. Well, thank you all so much for your time. This has been a fantastic conversation. Like Dr. Seixas said, sleep is an investment. And if you missed any of today's panel,"
No, you can view the recording on demand on Harvard Chan School's YouTube page. Have a good afternoon. Get some good sleep. And we'll see you next time.
No, Hello everyone welcome to medsimplified . Hygiene A small word . Most of u when we hear this word think about our daily routine of bathing changing into fresh clean clothes cleaning our room etc to be hygiene .

Environment, sleep . Prioritize Sleep : It might be tempting to skip sleep in order to work study socialize or exercise but it ’ s vital to treat sleep a a priority . Calculate a target bedtime based on your fixed wakeup time and do your best to be ready for bed around that time each night . Make Gradual Adjustments : If you want to shift your sleep time don ’ t try to do it all in one fell swoop because that can throw your schedule out of whack . Instead make small stepbystep adjustment of up to an hour or two so that you can get adjusted and settle
No, into a new schedule . Don ’ t Overdo It with Naps : Naps can be a handy way to regain energy during the day but they can throw off sleep at night .

Environment, Keep Your Routine Consistent : Following the same step each night including thing like putting on your comfortable night clothes and brushing your teeth can reinforce in your mind that it ’ s bedtime . Budget 30 Minutes for Winding Down : Take advantage of whatever put you in a state of calm such a soft music light stretching reading and/or relaxation exercise . Dim Your Lights : Try to keep away from bright light because they can hinder the production of melatonin a hormone that the body creates to facilitate sleep .
No, Unplug from Electronics : Build in a 3060minute prebed buffer time that is devicefree . Cell phone tablet and laptop cause mental stimulation that is hard to shut off and also generate blue light that may decrease melatonin production . Test Methods of Relaxation : Instead of making falling asleep your goal it ’ s often easier to focus on relaxation . Meditation mindfulness paced breathing and other relaxation technique can put you in the right mindset for bed . Don ’ t Toss and Turn : It help to have a healthy mental connection between being in
No, bed and actually being asleep . For that reason if after 20 minute you haven ’ t gotten to sleep get up and stretch read or do something else calming in low light before trying to fall asleep again . It ’ s not just bedtime habit that play a part in getting good sleep . Incorporating positive routine during the day can support your circadian rhythm and limit sleep disruption . Number 3 . Positive daytime routine Get Daylight Exposure : Light especially sunlight is one of the key driver of circadian rhythm
Environment, that can encourage quality sleep . Be Physically Active : Regular exercise can make it easier to sleep at night and also delivers a host of other health benefit . Don ’ t Smoke : Nicotine stimulates the body in way that disrupt sleep which help explain why smoking is correlated with numerous sleeping problem . Check out our video on how smoking affect your body – by clicking the banner above . Reduce Alcohol Consumption : Alcohol may make it easier to fall asleep but the effect wear
No, off disrupting sleep later in the night . As a result it ’ s best to moderate alcohol consumption and avoid it later in the evening .

While what make a bedroom comfortable can vary from one person to the next but these tip may help make it calm and free of disruption :
No, Have a Comfortable Mattress and Pillow : Your sleeping surface is critical to comfort and painfree sleep so choose your mattress and pillow wisely . Use Excellent Bedding : The sheet and blanket are the first thing you touch when you get into bed so it ’ s beneficial to make sure they match your need and preference . Set a Cool Yet Comfortable Temperature : Finetune your bedroom temperature to suit your preference but prefer it on the cooler side . Block Out Light : Use heavy curtain or an eye mask to prevent light from interrupting
Environment, your sleep . Drown Out Noise : Ear plug can stop noise from keeping you awake and if you don ’ t find them comfortable you can try a white noise machine or even a fan to drown out bothersome sound . Try Calming Scents : Light smell such a lavender may induce a calmer state of mind and help cultivate a positive space for sleep . Is Sleep Hygiene the Same for Everyone ?

No," In this video I'll answer the question, ""Are mental health and emotional health the same?"" Let's get started. When we strive to live a healthy life, we think mostly of losing weight, being more active and eating healthy. While these things will contribute to our overall wellbeing,"
No," they might not deal with some of the issues we prefer to neglect: emotional and mental health. You might find yourself wondering why these two aspects of being human are so important if no one can really see them, but that's exactly the point. Because we keep our feelings and emotions"
No," hidden from other people, they can become toxic over time, eventually leading to mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or a panic attack. Looking after our wellbeing and trying to live healthier is not just about the physical. So what's the difference"
No," between mental and emotional health? Mental health is described as behaviors and functions dealing with the mind and brain. It's how we process and store information, our cognitive thinking patterns and paying attention. These processes are fueled by various hormones and neurotransmitters, and can sometimes go awry."
No," This usually happens when there's an imbalance in these chemicals, either because of genetics and family history, or because of the misuse of mindaltering substances like drugs. It's estimated that at least one in five people in the United States suffers"
No," from some kind of mental illness. This includes conditions like depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Mental health conditions can also be triggered and worsened by chronic stress,"
No," which can have an impact on other health conditions like high blood pressure, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic inflammatory conditions. When don't learn how to deal with stress appropriately, we can become trapped in a neverending loop of physical and mental health issues. Emotional health is the lesser discussed"
No," third aspect to our overall wellbeing, but actually plays a more significant role in our health than we think. Our emotional health is intertwined with our mental health and our ability to handle stress. If mental health is how our brains think and function, emotional health is how we express"
No," to help us relieve feelings of depression, anxiety, stress, anger, disappointment, and more. Think of it like the one feeding the other, and the stronger the one is, the better the other and vice versa. If you feel that you may be suffering from a mental illness, it's best to see your healthcare provider"
No," for advice and possible treatment. You can also work on improving your emotional health by trying some of the following tips: daily meditations and mindfulness practice, practice positive thinking and positive affirmation, think before you act. Look after your physical health"
Environment," by exercising and sleeping enough as it can help to reduce stress. Create a balance between work and leisure activities. Connect with others. Try talking about how you feel and your daily struggles. Be aware of your emotions and feelings, what triggers them, and if they are exaggerated."
Environment," Mental and emotional health are not the same thing, but they do work too together and keep you balanced, happy, and stressfree. Next time you hit the gym to improve your physical health, remember that these two important aspects of your wellbeing should not be neglected. Well, I hope your question was answered."
No," Do you have anything you can add to the topic? Share what you know in the comments below. Don't forget to like the video and subscribe to the channel. And remember, what's learned here, leaves here. Share something you learned about mental and emotional health with a friend. See you later."
No," Healthrelated quality of life , what that means , how we measure it and how it might be useful in clinical practice . So first , one is healthrelated quality of life . Well , it 's the quality of life relative to one 's health or disease status , fairly straightforward . It 'S been identified as"
No," a goal for all people across all life stages by leading health organizations . There are many healthrelated quality of life models applied across different health and illness conditions across the lifespan and among individuals , their families and communities . Healthrelated"
Environment," broad dimensions subsume more specific dimensions such as emotions , cognitive function , economic status and intelligence , and they may incorporate friends and family . So first , let 's think about what are some different measures . We can take that to"
No," here to measure respiratory output , and so this will give us a value that we can use to kind of determine how well somebody 's respiratory functioning is working . We'Ve got specific symptoms that we can ask the patient , so we can ask them"
No," things like over the last four weeks . I'Ve had shortness of breath and they agreed on a scale saying almost every day . Several days a week a few days a month or not at all , you can look at the impact of disease , specific problems , so respiratory specific . So not just what"
No," treatment , return to work , work , productivity and mortality . So how do we conceptualize healthrelated quality of life - and I mentioned there are several different models . So , let 's start with one of the first models that was developed , the Wilson and Cleary healthrelated"
Environment," the environment , when individual factors are associated outcomes , thus affecting total healthrelated quality of life . So , following the establishment of us Wilson , Cleary model group revised their model and kind of simplified . It a little bit so what they did was they kept the"
No," covers infants , children and adolescents , the who has conceptualized healthrelated quality of life as an individual 's perception of his or her health and Health related domains of wellbeing , health and health related domains have been further conceptualized"
No," measures how decrements and physical function affect daytoday activities , impact a physical impairment or disability on healthrelated quality of life and then the other summary scores for mental components . The impact of mental aspect or symptoms of pain , on"
No," regarding physical function , whereas question 7 and 8 have to do with bodily pain and so forth . So you get these different scales . These are the 8 different scales we have here and here 's the summary measures , so each each of these scales contributes to one of these"
No," to just type in your numerical , the numerical value of your response and then it 's going to calculate your scores on these different areas . Um . So definitely not only fill out that form , but also score it and kind of see where you fall on it and you know think"
No," about . Was it surprising to you or were you know , are there any areas that you 're kind of like yeah ? I figured that was not so great . It 'S it 's kind of fun to check out on everything . Um feel free to try this out on . You know , friends , family and stop in Tennessee how"
No," life ? So I want you to think back . We'Re gon na do a throwback to last semester . Drug lit , and this is where you 're mad research skills are gon na , come into play . Okay , so you 're gon na think , like a little bit like a researcher here , I 'm gon na ask some very important questions . So one are"
No," have poor quality of life or improvement in patients who already have a good quality of life ? Will it measure differences between patients or over time and to what extent , who completes the measure , patients , their family or professional ? What effect will this have ?"
No," response inhibition, which helps us not be impulsive working memory, which helps us hold information in our head temporarily or remember it while we work with it Set shifting, which is what helps us shift between tasks that have different cognitive demands. And the ability to delay immediate gratification"
No, to building a ramp for someone in a wheelchair. It’s a necessary accommodation if we want to get to where we’re trying to go. Not everyone with ADHD has impairments with all of the cognitive processes involved in executive function For example one brain’s working memory might be just fine but everyone with ADHD does have impairment
Environment," When trying to create an ADHD friendly environment, you might consider “what would make things easier on executive function?” If there are behaviors you want to discourage, you might ask “what would require MORE executive function? How can I make doing this thing harder?” And if you’re having a bad brain day"
No," because you didn’t sleep well last night? You could say: “My executive function isn’t doing great right now. Mayyyybe I need to skip the complicated intro.” Because, as my good friend Eric Tivers puts it, “we can do hard things, but we don’t need to do them in the hardest way possible.” You can check out some of our videos on"
Environment," and then , as kind of an example . We'Re going to talk about leisure and how leisure is important for these different concepts or how leisure is related to health . So my objectives for the talk are first to explain these terms . So talk"
Environment," about health , wellbeing and quality of life and then second , to identify and talk about the ways that leisure can contribute to these different ideas . So we 've likely heard all of these terms"
Environment, environmental wellness so or being well in the environments that we 're in and with the environments that we 're in and others will describe um economic wellness or financial wellness . So being in this
No," , for example , considering pain right and the impact that feeling of pain has on our quality of life , so health related quality of life considers some of both the positives as well as some of the negatives"
Environment, about leisure and how leisure can be related to this idea of health . So leisure can be many things . Leisure is the things that we do in our time when we 're free from our other obligations . So while we might think of leisure as
Environment," things that we do , that are kind of planned and purposeful , so things like exercising at the gym or working out or taking a class to learn a new skill um we need to think about . These are very broadly . Is that things that we do"
Environment," outside of obligations so um things like reading a book or engaging in creative activities like music or art or um , just going and chilling in the lake or hanging out in a hot tub ? Those are all leisure things that we do"
Environment," , that have implications for our health , and importantly , leisure activities are n't always exclusively positive for our health , so many leisure activities , things like smoking or engaging in other substances or drinking"
Environment," excessively . These are leisure time activities that can have detrimental effects to our health , but it can also have positive ones as well . So when we think about this health , leisure relationship"
Environment," overlapping context concepts . So if we look broadly at the leisure literature , we can identify some big kind of broad trends and caldwell has laid this out really nicely taking a kind of sweeping review of the"
Environment," leisure literature and how it relates to health or wellbeing and there 's three kind of Broad categories that this fits into - and this is prevention , coping and transcending . So while this literature talked about"
Environment," many different activities , many different kind of dimensions of health , many different demographics or groups of people , we can kind of look broadly at the way that leisure can be a way of preventing negative outcomes or preventing decline"
Environment," feeling . Confident and competent so feeling that sense of accomplishment with the activities that we do and also providing continuity . So when experiencing negative things , because our leisure activities are outside of obligations"
Environment," and how we can use them well and then we kind of briefly took a look at how leisure can be implicated in these concepts so moving forward . We want to think about how leisure can affect health , wellness and health"
No, japanese difference between diploma group me yeah . So the second uh course learning outcome is to before you are able to uh to determine uh what intervention

No," dysfunction associated with secretary disorder of childhood , including preventive role of in traditional and nontraditional mental health setting current and future . So you need focus around problembased learning method of"
No," inquiry . So in this course i will uh compliment . Complement the topic with the problembased learning , but in ot it 's more on case scenario and case nero"
No," based learning . So so what are the integration and the integration can be uh , quantity , psychosocial and also , and then they have also stress management"
Environment," , social skill , training and group therapy . Reality orientation reminiscent therapy , so anyone knows about reminiscent therapy reminiscent therapy talking about reminding the the situation ."
Environment," conditions and also the the condition of the symptom right symptom of psychotic disorders and , at the same time , the environment , for example , they 're living in institutional institutions . They all been"
No, or t in mental health and wellness . Then second week will be role of 40 in management time with physical dysfunction and then we 're talking about critical model and free of reference inside for social rehab
No," and evidencebased study . So what when talk about , i do we do n't base study . What is it and then third week will be goal setting and treatment planning and also activity analysis . This is very important in terms of ot intervention"
No," , and then mental health physical activity , so this require enabling participation so in in mental in terms of intervention , our integration is very good is very important . We have a physical activity"
Environment," do n't know how mr blake went then then therapeutic play then live social and skill , training and then foundation and cognitive approach and realization training . Then rt integration in different settings like"
No, hospital based community institutions . So what about the intervention right in that setting then uh ? I will provide problembased learning it 's more on case management
No," practical . You'Ve got case of focus schizophrenia , so description of history in terms of family , so xmlt what you 're going to do so . This is more on pbl , case management and then actually there 's no"
No," , the administration , the the value of this physical activity . I will give you the guideline : okay , uh , welcome to so uh . I summarize the"
No," So if there is no question , i i stopped sharing this scheme of work right so for today will be only introduction in second all right , yeah powerpoint in mental health and wellness ."
No," By the end of this lecture , you were able to understand the learning outcome of the course specific for ot intervention in psychiatry and , at the same time you as a degree student . You are able to"
No," , they wo n't allow the treatment unless the evidence involves a randomized political trial . Therefore trial randomly test with the placebo , so they access the outcome . Then they decide . This is the evidence"
No," the course i already told you . We do n't have any final exam . Only continuous assessment , then , in this topic , understand the history of mental health . You all have to know the history of ot in mental health . Actually ot"
No," in mental health is quite our profession , actually uh , being recognized and known in psychiatric setting in mental health , so and then define all the roles in mental health in the context of world health organization and malaysia"
No," ministry of health . So you need to understand your role in mental health in the context of who were , and also in nature , under our ministry of health . So these syllabus schema online have been"
Environment, occupation . The earliest evidence of using occupation as a method of delay of therapy can be found in ancient times and in 104th century by greek physician . As escripes initiated human treatment of patients
Environment," with mental illness using therapeutic bugs massage exercise and music , so before century , a great physician , they use the modality massage , massage and exercise and music also , i need , before century"
Environment," later , the roman celsius prescribe music travel conversation and exercise to His passion so celsius and roman letter prescribed music , music , travel conversation and conversation . Individual"
No," discussion , motivation , advice counseling , however , by medieval times the concept of human treatment of people considered to be insane was rare , if not unresistant , slightly okay . In 19th century europe"
No," revolutionaries such as philly final and johann christian real reformed the hospital system instead of the use of mental chains and restraints , the institution utilized , rigorous work and legit activity in the late"
Environment," 18th century , rigorous work and leisure activities in the late 18th century . So this was the error of moral treatment , so they call it moral treatment in unity , foreign ."
Environment, This was the error of monetary money . Developed in europe travel any their rigorous work and leisure activity at the late century 18th century . This was the era of moral treatment developed in europe during
No," enlightenment , where what 's up okay activity , they call it moral treatment . So this is the root of oti"
No," society emerged against the monotony , monotony and lost autonomy of factory work utilize , a way of promoting learning through doing and provided an Outlet of creative energy and way of avoiding the boredom"
Environment," , now called the american orti association . Now from that , the other concept they call it american or the association and they 're not promoting occupation . So there is an occupational association was founded in 1917"
No," them they are the parents and the community , our people , our nation , recognize this is very important therapy , the"
Environment," uh , psychosocial problem , posttraumatic disorder or stress , grief , depression . All these things they do they 're making a toy mechanic is one of the occupation tasks"
No," reductionist , reductionistic philosophy for a time , while the approach led to development in technical knowledge about occupational performance creation became increasingly dissolution and reconsidered . This belief ."
Environment," As a result , client centeredness and occupation have reemerged as dominant themes in the profession over the past century . The underlying philosophy of orti has evolved from being a diversion from illness"
Environment," to three months whenever through meaningful occupation . This became evident through the development of widespread adoption of canadian centeredness and occupational emotion , so uh philosophy or tears , involving"
Environment," uh being a diversion from illness and therapy . Hey ask : we enabled them through meaningful , meaningful occupation . This became evident through the development and widespread adoption of canadian model of"
Environment," occupational woman . So last time we only involve our diversion occupied their their their time . But right now we do a treatment . True , meaningful occupation"
No," , mental and social wellbeing , the necessity for mental health care to be integrated with the rest of the health program is beyond doubt . So when talked about complete physical , mental health , social being"
No," mental healthcare must be integrated . So , in terms of mental health action recognize mental health care must be integrated in the help of them in the under mystery of health and when , whenever they develop curriculum all that mental health , mental"
No," health care must be dead must be embedded so activity related to mental Health care , whose ultimate goal is the improvement of the quality of life of the general population , so the ultimate goal in mental health is to"
No," quality of life right . So what are the things that the population should do in terms of mental health care ? They should promote , promote mental health , mental health and then prevention of"
Environment," mental and psychosocial disorders , not only promote . We have to prevent prevention of mental and psychosocial disorder and then the third target is to do rehabilitation of people"
Environment," with mental and psychological disorder . So we need to rehab whoever got this mental and psychosocial disorder . We have to do rehabilitation , and the fourth target is that we have to do psychosocial rehabilitation , so"
Environment," psychosocial rehabilitation is involved with the community so like oti . If ot has three patients that bought therapy , the included occupation , occupation yeah at the end"
No," , that must be acceptance from the committee parent . They must accept the color to accept so the patient will be stranded at the institution , so we not only promote mental health"
No," , but also we do prevention and then we do rehab and then we do psycho social . We have mutations for four things : goal of mental health care must be 14 , so our team must involve in terms of promotion , prevention"
Environment," , rehabilitation and involvement . Such psychosocial rehab with the community so definition of mental health is the capacity of the individual , the group and the environment , to interact with one"
Environment," definition of mental health in our national mental health policy ministry of health nation all right , so mental health is the capacity of individual , the group , the environment . So we need to address the capacity of the individual"
Environment, together they can work or participate together in the group and to the environment in environment can be the within the community in workplace in their house in order to promote subjective
No," wellbeing and optimal functioning . So we as an ot , we need to cater the individual and their parents , their spouse and then their community eh , so that they can have uh optimal functioning in the use of"
No," skill and knowledge , good mental health and wellbeing have even untoward consequence of social economic development and changes so activities that functional psychosocial muslim at the committee is called psychosocial ."
No," The psychological skill , psychology skills for what they 're able to tolerate frustration be able to tolerate comments , they 're able to tolerate skastic . They are the mechanisms popping skills to fashion the community"
No," mean uh , med , aponi , uh misty effect address only mental health issue , but also the wellness management category , normal people again normal people , okay , uh , okay"
No," , so not only addressing mental health , but Also mental problem , but also normal people , normal people they relate on wellness awareness right also can be described as the constant"
Environment," move towards rehabilitation in the community , so the clinic saturn cycle , social rehabilitation , you all put another clinic 's - need A community message : what do you respect the reality of life"
Environment," , real tasks of living and the immediate mode of coping with daily tasks ? It has been shown that artists value occupation , they use a wide variety of treatment , techniques and approach to establish healthy habits of healthcare"
No, and psychosocial wellbeing . What is an important and integral part of the team providing the therapy service in hospital and community settings prevention ? What is your role in adult secretary and
No," mental health ? This is the thing you follow the hospital you could do , the hospital , the institution . You also do promotion , you forgive what promotion can be . Primary prevention can be"
Environment," psychological and psychosocial intervention aim at reducing the impact of the disease , psychic psychosocial rehabilitation , more on working with the community . You know"
Environment," in , for example , when i working in vermont , i do a lot of psychosocial rehabilitation . I established half a half , we have happy house is the transit house when they move from when they discharge from the hospital"
No," institution . Mr bombay , so they stay at the happy house over the happy house . We find their job integrate them to the community and then , after the independent they go to their real house . They ran by themselves , they get married"
Environment," , they have family , that 's barack , so i do a lot of psycho rehab at the step of my head . Okay for this picture , what are these um ? Three occupational occupation"
Environment," , meaning of occupation again , so there is more different outcome . These people , the past skills , kilum about laymaking . The outcome is that a patient able to uh do a ponies , sell this thing as they put your livelihood release their"
No," color . You , the asic and product you 'll , be satisfied . Do that all right ? So this is one of the uh intervention play making clay making there , where the outcome is that uh , yes"
No," okay ! I need aircraft activities so malaysia , mental health , 2001 guitar , the uh mental health framework by ministry of health so emphasized they emphasize on the need for"
No," intersectoral collaboration and community participation in is a necessity for mental health care . The goal of mental wellbeing can not be achieved without participation from the community , so you need to have networking with the community agencies"
No," to be encouraged , so that survey can be expanded and extended . The committee , when you work in mental health , you need to have collaboration with the community community , must participate"
No," in mental health , okay , anyone any one of you , the issue of mental health , mental issues , anyone so that 's Why prevention is better than cure experience"
No," our community try to have by access treatment to them . That 'S why you need to understand whenever you ask female psychic , you need to understand the condition and then not only the person"
No, What design and then you present uh together and then i hope the same time manage your time right . Foreign is
No," So we have had some very interesting guests on our wednesday webinars and today 's is no exception , and we were very pleased that um , victoria and dee were going to join us today to um"
No," , so i will now pass over to victoria and we 'll begin the session . Thank you victoria . So , thank you so much sally and welcome everyone to today 's session on recovery , the science and art of generating hope , uh , so um just to give us a brief"
No," and to improve your recovery and wellbeing . So we do hope you will enjoy today 's session and i 'm now going to pause over to dee to start looking at the recovery principles . Thank you , victoria um . So we 're going to start with a brief"
No," not your injury or diagnosis , it 's about moving away from pathology , illness and symptoms of towards health , strength and wellness , and that keeps people well . It gives their life value and meaning and enable sustained change ."
No, Hope is central to recovery . It can be enhanced by individuals seeing how they can have more control . It allows the individual to focus on what is possible and to learn how to thrive . Instead of just trying to survive
No," learning how to manage a condition has been shown to enhance hope which in turn , acts as a catalyst for change and recovery . So selfmanagement is encouraged and facilitated in recovery programs ."
No," of it as rediscovering personal identity that is separate to illness and disability , identity , language , meaning and stories , have great significance to recovery and they 're Aimed at supporting hope"
No," , rather than inviting pessimism or chronicity , so that 's part of the reason - we 're called energize health because it 's it 's about helping people notice that energy and move forward with it ."
No," So i think i 'll just summarize there that essentially recovery programs are a process towards change living life . As well as possible , enabling hope and rediscovery of personal identity"
No," most definitely it was low mood and pain were her predominant problems . So thank you . So we 've got two programs that we offer . We'Ve got energized recovery , which is designed for participants who are at that very early stage in their"
No," such as pain , stress , anxiety and depression , poor sleep , reduced activity , levels , fatigue , etc . We support participants in the programs to develop a personalized toolkit of practical evidencebased selfmanagement strategies"
Environment, where it 's just a delivered course which is prerecorded and you would then just access it at your own time and leisure watch the prerecorded sessions and do your homework in your own time by by facilitated we 're talking about
Environment, something where people come in . At a set time and much like this in a live environment dee and i would actually be teaching them the the the skills etc . Um like we 're doing today
No," it . It 'S it 's much more difficult to focus on things like hope and language use . In a digital program , as opposed to a facilitated program - and we just really enjoy working with our participants"
No," that 's . Also , a really good question janet and i and i think , if you look at um learning styles , some people prefer one route and some people prefer another route . But i actually think that that"
No," something that we 've seen in the last year is on the one hand , people have got very much more skilled and familiar with this sort of platform of um learning as we 're doing this morning . Um . On the other hand , they 've got a"
Environment," , and i and actually , i think , that 's you know from the from the feedback that we 've captured from the groups to date . That group based learning environment has been something that people have just so valued . They felt so supported , and actually we"
No," circumstances will be different that you guys will be learning from each of your each of your service users as well , and that and that hops back to the recovery model . It 'S not about that patient expert ."
No," It 'S about we 're in this together as as colearners and actually yes , we 're bringing certain bits to this , but actually every individual who comes through our virtual doors is bringing something that we 're learning from as well and that other people can learn"
No, my medication was beyond belief . The emotional aspect to the point where suicidal you know from being completely active to very inactive . I have three limbs of my body not even working on our very first session
No," thinking about them and yeah from going from wanting to not be here anymore , not being part of the family to using these things to , and You know by the end of it i 'm doing tai chi in the woodlands with the with the eldest girl , and we were doing"
No," discussion with family things when the time it started opening up to family - and i think that 's probably the reason why ? Because i opened up the family , there was a lot more money . I'Ve been done on my medication and things like that and i 'm at the point where i 'm"
No," , she was active , she was actively suicidal and how , through the the Strategies that she learned on our program , she actually completely turned her life around , not only in terms of her mental health , but actually because of her mental"
No," health . She had also completely disengaged from her family . She was , she was pretty much living in an outhouse because she just could n't deal with being around her family and she had"
No," she 's got a big family lots of children and um and actually and she 's . She re she 's reconnected . She , you know she got in control of her of her mental health . She had pain problems and she managed to get those under control"
No, and the other thing was which we were absolutely delighted about . Was she reconnected with her family um and what was even better was that she was describing how she was using the strategies that she learned in connection
No," with her family members . So one of the things she describes is the way she reconnected with one of her daughters was to to do tai chi in the woods with her , because that 's one of the strategies that we teach"
No," : oh , let 's do some tai chi together , mom , and that Was kind of her way of going ? I need some love . I need some attention . I want to connect with you and actually now that relationship 's back to she said even better than it was before"
No," require any more pain medication . She was using these strategies , i have to admit my mouth rather my chin rather hit the floor when she shared that with me , um , but , but i think , sort of grounding it for leanne is that she"
No," does tell us . We helped her regain her hope that we , the program , helped her work out that she was liane again rather than somebody who 'd been injured and lost her personal identity . Suddenly she"
No," limited number of strategies to manage their condition , and then they exit with hope , like dee , just said , a strong foundation for their recovery , uh greatest interpersonal identity and their own personalized"
No," in their own toolkit , which is pretty cool . So how do we do this ? Well ? Each of the programs covers six modules , so we start with energy recovery and bodily sensations , which also includes"
No," pain . We then move on to thoughts and emotions . Then movement and activity then sleep . The fifth module is energizing , it is the energized recovery toolkit module and then the final one is energizing your recovery in the future"
Environment," , and we also give them lots of links to other helpful resources which they can go and look at at their own leisure . So the strategies that we introduce them to are all invitational and we are now going to invite you to"
No," so we 're going to cover the stop relaxation technique . Five teaspoons of energy and moments of mindfulness , so we 're going to start with relaxation and relaxation is a theme that runs through"
No," or your stress levels suddenly increase or you have a burst of pain , um or your family member has done something to upset you and you feel like you 're About to shout , then , you can take a moment to stop"
No, will actually give you an automatic relaxation . So that 's how our parasympathetic nervous system comes into play . So you take your breath . You observe what 's happening in your body in your thoughts in your
No," emotions in your behaviors . Maybe you were about to yell at somebody in the family and quite often we clench our fists . Don'T we so you take your breath , just relax your fists , um and then once you 've done that"
No," so rather than holding your fists up to that family member and getting ready to shout and scream at them . Maybe you just take that moment and you share what you need to say in a calm way , so the technique is really quick and can"
No," that amazing part of the nervous system that we can learn new things and we can learn new strategies . So , thank you very much and i 'm now going to hand over to victoria to talk about our next strategy . Five teaspoons of energy , so this is"
No, changing things up completely . This is five teaspoons of energy is a metaphor that allows us to consider our personal energy reserves . So picture this you wake up every morning
No," and you have five teaspoons of energy once you 've spent them they 're gone and you ca n't refill them until either you 've rested or ideally , you 've had a night sleep . So we know that energy expenditure is n't equal from day to day . As our activities are"
No," up On household tasks and then potentially a seventh more restful day and to accommodate for that sort of variation , we can reduce activity in one area to save energy for another activity on that same day"
No," , or we can borrow a teaspoon either from the day before or from The day after , but then you 've got to remember that only leaves you with four teaspoons on the day that you 've borrowed the the energy from"
Environment," so practical exercise . Now , for you , if you you 'd like to , is just have a think about yesterday and make a mental note or jot down the primary activities that you did , we 're going to give you a couple of minutes just to do that"
No," c. Okay ! So now , having a look at your list decide whether yesterday was a low , medium or high activity day and whilst you 're looking at that think about . Did you have enough energy to"
No," actually meet those demands and then , if it was a high activity day , think about where did you borrow the energy from ? Did you borrow it ? Did you borrow a little bit from today because you knew"
No," that today would be a little bit less energy intensive or maybe the day before and likewise if it was a low activity day ? Have you actually got leftover energy for today , because you knew that today would be a high"
No," , a high energy expenditure day , so , for instance , for me i do n't work on a tuesday morning . I have i have it off , it 's very , very , very luxurious um . So actually i had a whilst i worked in the afternoon and had quite a high"
No," energy intensive intensive couple of hours , then actually the morning was really relaxed . So actually i have carried over energy into today because i 've got a really busy day . So just have a think about that does um ."
No," walked in for two hours and did some housekeeping and then i worked in the afternoon . So i did have energy because i think walking . The dog gave me more energy , but i 'd still say it was a medium level day . So today i 've got a little bit"
No," left over and it is it 's such a helpful metaphor um , and it really can help you to plan your activities across a week and just think about you know just take that moment to think about how much energy we are Spending each day"
No," , and where is that energy coming from because actually our our energy is n't infinite and we 've we 've actually got to make sure that we 're we 're allocating it out in a reasonably even manner , and so it is , it 's quite helpful to look at it . From"
No," that perspective , so you might want to think about after today 's session . You might want to have a think about what you 've got planned for tomorrow and see where that energy is coming from . Are you going to leave a little bit over"
No, from today or are you going to grab some from what friday ? So i hope you find that another little helpful tip and do n't just you know you ca n't keep borrowing . You know from not just friday this week but friday
No," next week as well . Yes , so our final taster for today is something that we call moments of mindfulness . So mindfulness is the practice of paying full attention to whatever is happening in the present moment"
No," in reducing symptoms of depression , anxiety , stress and pain , leanne mentions in her interview that um she mentions a picture that one of her children drew for her and it 's in her bed . She does n't give the"
Environment," sensations noises outside her . You know love for her children , etc , etc , while she 's engaging with that picture and if we think back to the the five teaspoons of energy that victoria was talking about"
No," , we can actually use moments of mindfulness to help us restore and rebalance some of our expenditure . So , on a busy day , i quite often use a moment of mindfulness with a freshly made cup of tea"
Environment," exercise and i do n't have a cup of tea because it will be very cold by now . But i do have my my water bottle here and um for those of you who 've , perhaps not got a cup of tea or a suitable drink to hand ."
Environment," You might want to focus on the lovely picture of elephants victoria and i are very partial to elephants . So they appear in most of our presentations , and this is a particularly lovely one for the exercise that we 're we 're going to do"
No," Can you smell anything ? Where are your thoughts and how are your emotions and now just take a couple of deeper breaths and return your attention to the session ? One of the differences in mindfulness , as"
No," opposed to relaxation , is that we keep our eyes open . We talk in a relatively normal voice when we 're helping people learn mindfulness and also , if we 're doing it ourselves , we talk to us not ourselves . Normally"
No," we maintain awareness and presence in the moment , whereas relaxation a bit different with the stop technique , because it 's for threat activation , but most relaxation is done really quite gently a little bit more soothing a little bit"
No, slower . People may be asked to him to to close their eyes and so on so very different to the mindfulness that we 've just done janet sally . Do either of you have anything you 'd like to share with us
No," about that mindfulness moment . Well , i think i should be introducing this into all future webinars . It was lovely because you know you 're very you know , sort of when you 're doing something like this you 're aware that you 're being"
No," that 's a very good point victoria . I think we 'll have two minutes of mindfulness janet . What would you like to add , apart from the fact that my drink was cold , so i felt like i felt a very cold cat between my hands"
No," , but i do know that i have to do that more often , and even just that one moment is concentrating on That one thing which is not me thinking about another 100 things and that 's really important , i think that 's the thing is that we all know we"
No," mindfulness and all that we Know those things , but we do n't actually structure them into our day . I think that 's a very , very good point . Thank you . Sally um , there 's actually a phenomenon that"
No," do a moment of mindfulness . I i use my lounge curtains at that point . I call them my mindfulness curtains um , so that there are there are . There are gaps we can make use of um . So anyway"
No," claim . Um , we 've also been in liaison with certain um claimant solicitors as well , so they could refer directly into us if they wanted to um . You know there 's no reason why insurance companies could n't do so as"
No," of that page there is all our there are all our publications that you can go and find out about . Uh . Sorry , the rest of it . Can you just repeat that again yeah , so so what research feedback happy heart state and any other published info ?"
No," who 's joined us as well . We hope that that was very useful and i found it very , very useful and i think even just not not for sort of you know actually somebody in recovery or you know"
No," keep an eye on our on our website and we will send you uh email reminders as well and we do have another one coming up : um uh with d and victoria , which is on the 12th of may the 12th of may yes . So um , i hope , um . If you found that interesting , you 'll uh , everybody will be"
No," I can still remember the very moment i picked up my first personal development book that was about business . It was a four hour work week by tim , ferriss and that book is engraved in my memory . For a couple of reasons , i can remember perfectly . I was on my second material to"
Environment," leave literally sam . My youngest was a couple of days old sitting right beside me having a nap . I picked up this book and i heard the terms retiring early , passive income , financial independence . That then led me on to read books like tony robbins has money master the game"
Environment," and rammus said these ? I will teach you to be rich all which strive for a balance between financial health and security , and this concept fire kept coming up . Financial independence retire early . A couple of blog clicks later , a couple of instagram accounts . Later i was"
Environment," crossroads . We had 24 000 pounds worth of consumer debt . That was on credit cards and loans . I was effectively having to go back to work , regardless of what we wanted to do with two small boys . Now there was debts to pay . There was also the income was needed . We needed two"
Environment," different career . I could literally save up all the money as hard as we could pay off the date and build up this pot of money . That would allow us to have an income for life , and you can understand why that 's so alluring for a lot of people . It basically means you can quit"
Environment," financial security now you 've seen this many times before , but there 's often a formula that 's quoted for fire , your fire number , the total amount of savings that you should aim for and then be able to withdraw it . Four percent of your money every single year and then it would auto"
Environment," of your takehome income , which is a really good chunk , you know to put aside every month , it 's probably going to take you about 35 to 40 years , perhaps to achieve a fire number now that in a really Simple level does n't have inflation taken into account . It also . You"
No," thinking about okay ? How do i get paid without having to exchange my time for money as much ? I really like that . The fire community in a sense embraces this kind of . Let 'S see how much money we can earn so that , ultimately , we can invest and save it , and it allowed me to think"
Environment," outside the box of the different ways that i could have . Multiple sources of income , and also not just relying on the stock market , is one way to hit fire . I could actually have multiple ways if i chose as well . The final thing that i think fire gets so right is really the"
No," sense of community now , with any philosophy or any kind of system . The best thing you can do is get people to club together , who maybe got similar mindsets , and i think fire in particular has been embraced by a lot of people looking for a way , or maybe their current"
No," situation , and just thinking that that 's the only way . There 'S a real sense of everyone encouraging each other , not encouraging them in terms of their targets , their goals . Can they actually achieve it far quicker than they want , but also celebrating when people are on"
Environment, thing : your security and confidence in life does not come from money . No amount of money sitting in the bank will make you feel secure enough or confident enough to make life choices that you want to be making people think that they have . That number - let 's say it was a 625
No," 000 great . When i have that , i will feel secure i 'll , never have to worry again . Unfortunately , the fears and doubts and everything else you felt before about money , maybe you 're wondering if your job would go under stock market . Would it crash those fears are still going to be"
No," , it 's kind of the same philosophy that you see with the debtfree community . It 'S a couple of you know . Experts shall we say that say that you must feel guilty and you must do everything you can live off rights and means until you 're debtfree , there 's guilt being"
No, do . But the guilt placed onto people is not healthy . You do n't suddenly lose that when you get rid of your debt or hit a fire number - and i hate this sense of we have to put on hold living right now . Nothing is guaranteed in life and whether it 's debt free or perhaps a fire
No," community . Why are we placing all our living on a date in the future ? What if that date , never actually comes ? You know we might say in 10 15 years i can finally quit my job . I can travel . I can live well that time is n't guaranteed . Why ca n't you work towards goals , but also"
No, have flexibility with your resources right now to start enjoying your life and freedom with it ? You see here 's the thing that i 've noticed as well . The fire community has really been around for the past 20 30 years in some guys may have heard of mr money . Mustache and people
No," support and value to the people around you . It 'S all about . You know fitting in in the tribe , and so the moment that we hit a number . It does not mean that we 're useless that we do n't need to serve other people that we 're not of value far be it . Actually , we 've probably got life"
No, getting out having breakfast with your kids ? Are you taking them to school ? Are you serving in some way in the community ? What you love to share ? You writing a book . Are you actually going and talking to people making new friends and where are you living so i started to really
No," having choice and freedom in our mind and what we do in our day . So the point with work is not to escape from it , as we might think with fire . It 'S mortifying work , that 's of value and satisfying to you . It 'S that space and that opportunity to believe that , actually you can do"
Environment," there was no miracle ahead and What the world simply gave me was a method by then opening me up to the possibilities of different ways to create incompassive income as well . What happened was we actually started this business ? I started creating content , started : writing blog"
Environment," is a great concept to allow you to think you get that security , but here 's another great thing that i took from fire allowed me to get completely set on what i wanted in my life . It allowed me to get crystal clear on the milestones that would allow me to see what i really"
Environment," wanted . Now that actually meant you know , leaving my job having income different ways , and if i had n't seen that there was different ways to multiply the growth of my money through investments and stocks and shares and things i might not have had the confidence to start a business"
No, Or leave my job and that be a route for me as well . It also taught me a lot of lifechanging habits with my money before fire before learning about it . I did n't know how to invest . I did n't know how to save . I did n't know why people were using these vehicles and i thought
Environment," it was for other people richer people than me . Normal people did n't invest in the stock market or create passive incomes . It was only those who were lucky enough to have enough money that could do that . There 'S also another couple of habits , so it did n't teach me directly"
No," tested some of these other principles and habits myself . The great thing as well , through having the experience of understanding the fire community being part of it and also coming out the other side of it , as well , with my own version of things that work for me , it 's allowed"
No," so never give money . The recognition of being the only way that you can make things happen . You can make things happen completely depending on how resourceful you are , and that 's time , energy things in the world as well as money . So , thank you so much for watching today and i hope it"
No," really challenged you if you 're interested in fire , some of the things that nobody really talked about . As far as i could understand , some of the things that i 've learned in my own journey on being the other side of going through it - and i hope it 's really helped you if it"
Environment," achieve that . A lot of people would love to achieve in their life . Having that time freedom , i would just say , there 's probably more ways to achieve the thing that you truly want , which is your time : freedom and security than just through saving a certain amount of money from a"
No," fire number , and all that involves . So . Thank you . So much for watching today , why not check out this video right here ? It 'S on a similar topic . You can also hit subscribe and you can follow me long term as well tons of other videos over 350 now 400 on this channel . So i hope"
No," Last week we talked about sleep , we talked about how much the average person needs and how much they get . We also talked about how you ca n't just rely on averages to determine how much sleep you need . Sleep is a personal thing . We all need different amounts . Sleep is"
No, incredibly important . You have to do it not getting enough sleep or having sleep . Deprivation is a real and bizarre thing . It 'S also the topic of this week 's healthcare triage sleep deprivation can leave people more sensitive to pain . A study published in
No, 2010 took people and randomized them to coding or placebo . They also measured the quality of their sleep . They found that people who were in the sleepy group were more sensitive to pain . They also found that codeine did n't work as well . In the sleepy group . Another study published in
No," 2012 confirmed these findings . Volunteers were randomized to normal sleep habits or extended sleep . Then they measured pain sensitivity . They also found that extended sleep was associated with reduced levels of pain , sensitivity . There are lots of studies like this , so"
No," sleeping away , your pain might be a thing . Sleep deprivation can affect emotional empathy , a study published just last year , randomized participants to one of three groups . The first group was n't allowed to sleep at all . The second group was allowed to sleep normally and both of"
No," another , such as i 'm angry or sad . That happened to someone else . Indirect empathy is how it affects you , such as your heart racing , or you feel nauseous . They found that the sleep deprived group had significantly less direct and indirect emotional empathy . They measured"
No," everyone twice to confirm it . It 'S hard to do longterm studies in this manner , though , you ca n't deprive people of sleep for months to see if they develop physical or mental problems , but there are many cohort studies that show that sleep deprivation is associated with"
No," diabetes and obesity . We do n't know the causal direction , though it 's also hard to do studies in kids . They have to go to school after all , but there are comparative studies for them too . Many of them show that kids , who are sleep deprived , are more likely to be depressed ."
No," Last year , a study of more than 100 adolescents in korea , with and without behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome were studied . The academic performance of the kids with insufficient sleep was significantly worse ."
No," This also confirmed the results of many other studies that have had similar results . The results also hold true for kids in middle school , high school and even in college . Sleep deprivation is a bad bad thing academically and if you demand controlled trials , they do exist ."
No," In 2003 , a study was published in the journal of sleep research that took 50 college students and compared their performance on math effort tasks . After a night of normal and sleep deprived sleep , it should come as no surprise that the sleepdeprived kids were more likely to"
No, show less effort in selecting tasks . Another study published in 2010 showed that female athletes who were sleep deprived were less likely to believe in themselves . Not getting enough sleep may strip kids of their ability to challenge themselves and become better there 's a
Environment," growing course that believes that we as a society are setting teens up to fail . We know they need this much sleep , but we make them get up at the crack of dawn . When i go to the gym at 6 , 45 all the high schoolers are already out waiting for the bus , so unless they go to bed at"
No," 9 00 pm , it 's almost impossible for them to get 9 hours of sleep , let alone 10 because of this groups , like The american academy of pediatrics have asked for school start times to be pushed back to a more civilized hour . After all , there 's no reason school has to start so early"
No, more than 40 percent of high schools start before 8 am the later . They start the more likely kids are to get more sleep . A study from the center for applied research and educational improvement from the university of minnesota found that when school started
No," at 7 , 30 about a third of kids got at least eight hours of sleep a night . If school started close to nine , am then twothirds of adolescents got that much sleep . Academic tests and athletic performance are n't the only things at stake here , though sleep deprivation"
No, causes lots and lots of car accidents . The american academy of sleep medicine reports that more than 80 000 people fall asleep at the wheel each day in the united states . They also report more than 250 000 sleeprelated motor vehicle accidents each year about 20 percent of
No," serious injuries due to accidents are related to sleep . Alcohol use does n't help either . Studies show that astronauts who are sleepdeprived are more likely to have errors in performance . They show the same in airline , pilots and physicians because of this . Pilots are"
Environment," forced to work only a certain number of hours at a time , and recent regulations have placed the same requirement on physicians and training when people work too much and get too little sleep accidents happen . Sometimes they cost lives . Sleep deprivation has real effects"
No," “This is precisely the risk modern man runs: he may wake up one day to find that he has missed half his life.” Carl Jung, Practice of Psychotherapy Psychotropic drugs have become one of the most common forms of treatment for anxiety disorders and depression. But these drugs are not very good at curing people and often they just become crutches for lifelong psychological cripples. Fortunately, there are alternative ways to treat anxiety and depression."
No," In this video we are going to turn to Carl Jung, one of history’s greatest psychiatrists, for drugfree advice on how to find a cure to these psychological disorders. “. . . the elite still cling firmly to the notion that [anxiety] disorders originate in alterations within the brain. Unfortunately many runofthemill doctors still swear by this gospel to the detriment of their patients, whom our age produces in swarms. Nearly all these patients have been convinced by the medical dogma that their sickness is"
No," of a physical nature.” Carl Jung, The Symbolic Life Jung believed that most cases of anxiety and depression are not the product of a faulty brain, but of a faulty way of life. The first step in Jung’s method of treatment, therefore, was not a drug prescription, but a dose of psychological insight – insight regarding what to expect from life and insight into what it takes to change. With respect to the former, Jung noted that many people believe that life should be easy,"
No," will be less motivated to overcome a weak character, as we will falsely hope that if we just give it time life will get easier. “Life is a battleground. It always has been, and always will be; and if it were not so, existence would come to an end.” Carl Jung, Man and His Symbols There is another piece of psychological insight that Jung saw as crucial for his patients to understand – namely, that our problems"
No," as possible in space and time. Otherwise he would run the risk of having to make a change for the better. Compared with this odious risk it seems infinitely more advantageous either to put the blame on to somebody else, or, if the fault lies undeniably with oneself, at least to assume that it somehow arose of its own accord in early infancy.” Carl Jung, Two Essays on Analytical Psychology With these doses of psychological insight, Jung would turn to the first actionable step in his method of treatment; and this was to"
No," ourselves. “…there can be no doubt that man is, on the whole, less good than he imagines himself or wants to be. Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.” Carl Jung, Psychology and Religion Jung believed that facing up to the shadow was crucial in the process of selfchange for several reasons."
No," Happily, nature sees to it that the unconscious contents will irrupt into consciousness sooner or later and create the necessary confusion.” Carl Jung, Mysterium Coniunctionis But the shadow is not only made up of weakness, rather some elements of it are strengths which we repressed in our youth because our peers, family members, or society at large, gave us the false impression that these traits were bad. Some people, for example, repress the ability to express anger or the ability to stand up"
No," Carl Jung, Psychology and Religion One way to become conscious of the shadow is to observe the weaknesses, flaws, and insecurities of those close to us. For not only do most of us repress similar character traits, but we also tend to project elements of our shadow onto other people. If, therefore, we pay attention to which character traits of our friends and family bother us, we may also gain a glimpse of our own shadow. In addition to observing others, another way to bring the shadow into the light of consciousness"
No," is to reflect on the motives for our actions, especially actions we are ashamed of, and to be open to selfcriticism when it is warranted. For as Jung notes, often the only thing that is preventing us from seeing our shadow is the ability to be honest with ourselves: “With a little selfcriticism one can see through the shadow” (Carl Jung Aion). Along with becoming more conscious of the shadow, another integral aspect of Jung’s method of treatment was helping his patients find a meaning to their lives."
No," For Jung believed that when stuck in a deep depression, or consumed by an anxiety disorder, to be cured necessitates discovering a “role as one of the actors in the divine drama of life” (Carl Jung, The Symbolic Life). To understand what was meant by this we can turn to an encounter Jung had with a chief of the Pueblo tribe in the first half of the 20th century. Jung was discussing with this man the traditions of his tribe when the chief made the following remark:"
No," “Yes, we are a small tribe, and these Americans, they want to interfere with our religion. They should not do it, because we are the sons of the Father, the Sun. He who goes there”; (pointing to the sun) – “that is our Father. We must help him daily to rise over the horizon and to walk over Heaven. And we don’t do it for ourselves only: we do it for America, we do it for the whole world.” Carl Jung, The Symbolic Life Jung understood that to many in the modern"
No," day this statement would sound crazy and archaic. But as he further notes the members of this tribe did not suffer like we suffer. They were not infected by neuroses, anxiety disorders, or depression. They did not fill themselves with pills each day, and they were not debilitated by addictions. Rather this tribe was composed of highly functioning individuals who saw themselves as fulfilling their duty as an actor in the divine drama of life, and their lives were rich in meaning and purpose."
No," Carl Jung, The Symbolic Life Jung contrasts this way of life, with a Western woman he met. This lady, as Jung notes, was a compulsive traveller, always running from one place to the next, always seeking, but never really finding what she was looking for. “I was amazed when I looked into her eyes – the eyes of a hunted, a cornered animal – seeking, seeking, always in the hope of something. . . She is possessed . . .And why is she possessed?"
No," A career, producing of children, are all maya compared with that one thing, that your life is meaningful.” Carl Jung, The Symbolic Life Jung was not suggesting that we all adopt the Puebloan mythology, rather his point is that many people suffer because their life makes no sense. And the task for those who want to be free of anxiety or depression is to discover this sense."
No," We must, in other words, find a way to justify our existence, so that we, like the Puebloan, can believe that our life is meaningful. For some this can be accomplished through religion, for others by contributing in a substantial way to the promotion of values such as justice, freedom, or community, while others will find it through the creative act. But for those of us in the modern West, where we lack a dominant mythology, it is up to us, and us alone, to discover how we can play a meaningful role in the divine drama of life."
No," would lie to my wife About it and i would neglect my patients and as soon as i left the store i thinking now , i 'm complete my collection is full half an hour later . I'Ve had to run back"
No," addiction is : is that the i was n't using substances you were n't smoking or drinking or anything drugs , but i was looking for a chemical hit , dopamine dopamine yeah , so i was in a dopamine fiend , you might say , and i get"
No," struggle , a lot of you know , and finally i just realized that the cost was greater than the . In fact , you know , in fact , if i started listening now to all the cds that i have at home and they did nothing but listen for the rest of my life . You would n't finish - i"
No, what cost their this habit is exacting on their lives . It has to do also with some belief that there 's a part of us that 's actually healthy and we can get in touch with it . You know there has to be
No," it was just you know you get to you . You escape okay , right , yeah , you 're , not thinking about the pain or the shame or the insecurity so who needs to escape me ? No , but i mean what kind of person"
No," needs to escape . Oh , a scared person , scared person , somebody who 's in prison , is n't it somebody 's not free , trapped , yeah somebody 's trapped ? Exactly and i know in your book on toxic masculinity . You talk about being"
No," wound , so children who are are hurt but they 're not supported , seen , accepted and and helped they get trapped in a wound and being trapped in a wound and being"
No," you know , boys group growing up yeah , and so i feel like culturally there 's a lot of pain with men and women , obviously , but that it seems to be is causing a lot of the stress in the world right now . It 'S just"
No," this cultural pain . Well , if i may be selfserving , my new book is called the myth of normal trauma , illness and healing in a toxic culture . So it 's just , as you say , the trauma that people are experiencing"
No," could n't be hidden anymore . Why do you think in you know , in our modern society , with all the medical and scientific advances and all the the knowledge out there that there 's so much chronic pain , though so much suffering when we have more"
No," friend of mine . His name is uh lewis , mel madrona and he 's a an american physician , his lakota background , okay , and he told me that he 's a and he 's just like me he 's full of respect for western medicine . I was trained in it . He"
No," was trained in it , we also see what 's missing and he said that in his his tradition , when somebody got sick , the whole community gathers and thanks the person and says you 're carrying"
Environment, some dysfunction in our whole culture . So your healing is our healing wow . So so they get that the individual represents the culture and the environment and the family and the community . Now western medicine totally forgets
No, the tension in me and we 'll pick up on that and that 'll be the intuition . The yeah that 'll change your brain and i take it a step further . I talk about interpersonal biology so that what happens to people 's physiologically is very effective . I'Ll . Give you two
No," examples : yes , but affected by their culture and and their family . So we 've known for decades that children whose parents are stressed are much more likely to have asthma . The parents stresses affect the"
No," physiology of the child breathing the breathing that they narrow the air to they cause inflammation by the way how to be treated with stress hormones , adrenaline and cortisol . You know we know"
No," american black women , the more experiences of racism . Then you have to endure the greater the risk for asthma . Really , we know that men who are sexually abused in childhood , the risk of heart disease triples um . I could go on uh women who suffer"
No," illness , the guy who first described multiple sclerosis , was a french neurologist rajon martin charcoal in the 19th century . He said that it was a disease caused by grief and longterm worry since then . There 'S been multiple studies"
No, in alignment . It 'S interesting . I was telling you this before off camera that and then um a previous relationship that i was in . I was feeling a lot of chest : pain and kind of tightness in my throat yeah and at one point
No," If you take that word flareup , which is what you used yeah . It 'S inflammation right , something 's , inflamed okay right , but where else do you use what else flares up ? You know what flares up is rage anger"
No," , but you had anger that you were n't expressing right . Hence your body flares up . Yes , we know that suppressed emotions cause inflammation . So had you come to me not had you come to me when i was out of"
Environment," really primary in most chronic conditions and if you deal with them now in this society , where there 's all these toxins in the environment and junk in the food And all who knows everything"
No," of normal was even how we think about disease . Like you , people say i have eczema or i have depression or i have rheumatoid arthritis or i have add now , there 's an assumption . There is n't"
No, there . The assumption is first of all is that there 's this thing called add : there 's this thing called eczema . There 'S this thing called rheumatoid arthritis or there 's this thing called depression . Then there 's an eye
No," that process will change . That 'S exactly actually how it is so for shorthand language . I understand it 's helpful to say i have depression right right , but how important is the words we choose right , it 's a bit , but it 's , but if"
No," there 's a friend of mine now , a recent friend dr jeff rediger , who 's a psychiatrist at harvard and last year , wrote a book called cured . The science of spontaneous healing that was the subtitle ."
No," , but i do check out the histories of people 's doctors . We all know people who 've got supposed to have two months to live or six months to live . Either medical treatment is failed or they refuse medical treatment . Then also"
No," Jeff and kelly have documented people they go on diets . They take supplements , they start meditating . They go in the nature , they 're yeah they 're , going to nature the whole thing . All those things are great yeah and , i think the , but i think jeff and i agree - and i think kelly"
Environment, talking about the importance of recognizing the impact of emotions and one 's relationship to oneself on one 's physiology . That 'S all i 'm talking about ! There 'S an external environment and then there 's an internal environment . You know our emotional environment
Environment," yeah that is connected to our i 'm , assuming our nervous system , our heart , our brain , the whole body and everything . And if our emotional environment is sick , then we 're probably going to be"
Environment," physically sick as well . Well , that 's what you 're ! That 'S that 's what your story actually um illustrates . Isn'T it as soon as you create a an internal environment , your physical"
No, comes to the surface in some ways . That 'S correct . That 'S the whole point and most of us i 'll speak for myself . I was n't taught - and i think most of us are not taught on how to express the emotional traumas . The emotional pains
No, fears insecurities shames guilt where we 're not taught the skills . It 'S one of the reasons why i started the school of greatness because i was like i wish . I would have learned these skills in school yeah . You know most of most people 's parents
No," Then you were n't the guy yeah , so your kids had had some traumas that they had to face because of you and their parents . It 'S not even a matter of skills , learning it 's deeper than that , because you do n't have to teach any one day old baby how"
No," know if he 's been on your program , but he um . He says that an angry child should be made to sit by themselves until they come back to normal . In other words , angering a twoyearold is not normal"
No," they do n't get what they want . You know they want a cookie before dinner and if you 're a good parent you 're not going to give them a cookie before dinner right . So when do you teach or when does someone learn how to not express anger ? Every 10 minutes , though"
No," well , here 's the point . If that toyota then starts screaming or throwing a tantrum getting angry , if you say time out and you 're not going to be with them now , you 're presenting a child with a"
No," interesting actually , because if i 'm not authentic or if i 'm , if i 'm authentic , then i 'm going to be alone exactly i 'm going to be on time Out or whatever , on it and and to the child the time what is life threatening"
No," , because you might be alone forever right . Yes , chad does n't know that you see yeah so basically you 're throwing the ch threatening the child with depriving of the greatest need , which is the connection with you . Yeah love yeah , the love yeah ."
No," to pick them up . You'Re angry with daddy , are n't you you really wish you had that cookie yeah ? Oh , i get it , you know , and then the child relaxes and the anger moves through them , and you know what they learn . That anger is just"
No," something that moves through you . You can let go of it if you do n't see the child , do n't accept the child 's emotion they 're gon na have to repress it . You have to stop it what 's another way for stuffing it 's pushing down , trap it yeah"
No," , but pushing down . What 'S another word for pushing down depressing : where does depression come from ? It 'S not this disease depression comes from . Having had to push down your emotions , wow literally , you had to push down your emotions . In other"
No," both comes from coping mechanisms ? There are normal coping mechanisms in response to an abnormal situation : it 's not normal for a child to be banished from the presence of the parent . If you look at indigenous people , they carry their kids everywhere ."
No," The kids are always with the parents and the the pilgrims when they arrived in north america , they 're very upset with how the natives are reared their children . You know why , because the indigenous people did not"
No," hit their kids , they did n't hit their kids , they did n't hate their kids and the christians could n't understand this . Why they did n't uh , you know , a beat of you know , create obedience with them right . Is it yeah yeah , and so what do they do ?"
No," They nourish them and when you nourish a child , see nature has got a natural agenda . Is that you should grow up to be a selfregulated adult in connection with yourself and with other people . That 'S nature 's agenda . It 'S like"
No," about . Mostly it 's the question of meeting children 's needs , giving them the right conditions and then they will develop selfregulation . They learn it because yourself , like it aid , so they 're watching you you 're , not reactive and explosive"
Environment," screaming . You know your eyes . Oh i 'm angry . Okay , i 'm angry , but you 're not screaming at the kid you know , so in the right environment , these traits spontaneously evolve or develop in a human being"
Environment," , so our society is always about . How do we teach these skills and those skills ? Well , teaching is important , but more important is the child 's spontaneous growth given the right environment and what i 'm saying about this toxic culture ? We do n't"
Environment," give our kids the right environment yeah . I mean you hear the number the statistic that 50 of marriages turn into divorce these days and also probably , i think when i had esther perel on , i was like how many of the 50 that are married are actually happy . It 'S a very small"
No," There 'S two ways you can tell : if a marriage is unhappy one is you can ask the parents the other . Is you can measure the cortisol level of the children ? Oh wow , because the parent stresses affect the physiology of the child ? Oh man , my my"
No," cortisol , must have been off the charts but yeah all of us children yeah . It would have been , and so in this society - and this is not the fault of individual"
No," parents like it begins in the uterus , actually already stresses on the pregnant woman - will affect the physiology of the child really yeah . Oh yeah , no inner societies , so many pregnant women"
No," are so stressed in the states , particularly you 're , talking about more emotional stress because there 's physical stress of like the body 's , expanding and growing and aches and pains . But the emotional stress i mean the emotional stress of having to"
No," um the nervous system on the job or being in a difficult relationship and in one of the chapters in the book i talk about . It begins with the diary of my wife , who was writing it when she was pregnant with her one of her children"
No," That 'S how they experience it . Oh man , even if they 're looked after by someone or someone else , but the mother , the infant needs , the mother 's body yeah , that was my mom - was working pretty probably pretty fast . After each one of us were born , you know had to go back to"
No," Then it puts a lot and only that we did n't grow up in individual uh , isolated nuclear families did we we evolved in small band or huntergatherer groups where people supported each other"
No," , where children were with adults all day where adults collaborated they had to , otherwise they would n't Survive right so that 's where our nature actually evolved . So when you got to society"
No," , which tells you that people are by nature selfish and aggressive and competitive , which isolates mothers uh in in in in separate homes where the community is more and more , you know there 's lots of lots of work done"
No," by sociologists and others In the states about how communities are breaking down , there was that book uh bowling alone , some years ago , 20 years ago , now about the breakdown of community , so that people are not getting support and that"
No," means they 're stressed and the mothers are doing it all on their Own , exactly right and they 're , also expecting the husband to you , know , work and also be at home as opposed to reaching out to peers or family or friends . Exactly"
No," so it 's it 's a very unnatural culture and no wonder so . Many kids are getting diagnosed and then and with adhd or oppositional defiant disorder or depression . You know this article in the new yorker a few weeks ago , maybe a couple of months"
No," , they feel alone and they 're scared and scared , and then drug drug use is on the rise and all that addiction and that 's right , there 's nothing mysterious about it . If you look at the cultural setting , it 's only mysterious if you think we"
No," dealing with isolated mental health issues or isolated physiological issues . Don'T you see the connections , nothing mysterious ? So what are the main ?"
No," I guess mental health ? Are they diseases ? Are they not considered a disease like uh depression , abd adhd ? What are the main mental health symptoms out in the world right now ? Could you say"
No, yeah so and anxiety are fast growing and and their major challenges more and more kids are being diagnosed with adhd . More and more kids are being diagnosed
Environment," goes against , adult values and adult expectations yeah . But we think there 's something wrong with the kid . Instead of looking at the context of what makes the kids , the environment yeah no are these diseases ? Well"
No," , you can talk about them as diseases to some degree , and certainly you know . I'Ve had depression and i 've taken medication for it in my 40s and it really made a difference for me . You might call it a disease , but actually that 's a shallow way of looking at it"
No," chapter has a painting in it . The painting is by my wife , based on a photograph of me and my mother . This is budapest . Hungary , 1944 and i 'm three months of age and my mother in a photograph , is one of"
No," terror . I was absorbing my mother 's fear and my mother 's anxiety because she had tear on her face and you 're mimicking and , and she had it in her body , you 're connected to her eating ten times"
Environment," mechanism exactly 55 years later , i 'm diagnosed with adhd , which is characterized by tuning out . Is it a disease , the heck ? It 'S a disease , it started as a coping mechanism , i 'm also diagnosed with depression . Why ? Because in an environment i had to push"
No," my feelings down in order to not to burden my mother , it was already burned enough created more peace and yeah , so i took that on so i pushed on my feelings , i depressed my feelings . Then i have this depression . So are they diseases ?"
No," to such as you know , my wife ray . This is a therapist , so i 'm not like hallucinating . I know exactly where , but at the same time i 'm experiencing myself as a oneyearold infant . Oh , my goodness , and this therapist , then my mom is my mom"
Environment," because i want to maintain a level of peace yeah , and i want to continue to maintain peace good for you . So once i realized and started healing , i did n't say i 'm good yeah i was like i want to go to the next level of exactly peace . Yeah love . You know environment of"
No," beauty inside of my emotions , but why is it so hard for so many people to face it and actually speak the shame , guilt insecurity ? You know imperfection about them . Well , i think in your own work . You'Ve touched upon"
No," growing up from sports and yeah . You know okay , so that so this is that 's the house . So that 's one of the factors is the conditioning in this culture . Okay , i i also say it would have come from intense fear , oh because , if it actually it 's very fearful to look at all that"
No," pain inside oneself , it 's terrifying ! Yes , terrifying ! So there 's intense fear . So there 's the conditioning , as you say , then there 's the the fear . It really is painful , you know , you know , nobody wants to have pain , you know"
No," um , but that 's called growing , pains and uh . The third factor is we all develop this personality now the personality . We think that 's us , but it 's not us right . The personality is the traits that we took on to survive"
No," know , and so we think that we are a personality . So it comes from . I say three sources : one is uh , the conditioning , the other is the fear for the pain and , thirdly , the identification with the personality . We"
No," It 'S like you 've had this thing for decades . Maybe and you 've got to let go of this thing . Yeah i would n't even talk about killing . I mean i in my healing chapters of this book . I talk about , let 's make friends with it"
No," who does n't want to be wanted that much right . You know something with the ego or the desire yeah . So but we , but if we did n't , kill those parts but made friends with them . If somebody came to me"
No," I would n't say : kill that part of you i 'd say : let 's make friends with it , let 's find out what it 's really trying to do for you . What it 's trying to do for you is trying to make you feel wanted , making you feel valuable"
No," be present , really reflect on the the painful moments of the past , which a lot of people are n't even willing to talk about it to themselves right . That 'S right ! For 25 years i had a memory of being sexually abused and thought about it"
No," almost every day like for for a moment . You know it would come . You know at least weekly , maybe not every day , but it was like a memory yeah . That 'S there . You know , but i never told anyone for 25 years because it was so shameful and yeah"
No," i did n't want to be . You know , made fun of or all these things and um , so someone 's able to selfassess and say . Okay , i had this pain . This trauma . I felt not powerful or whatever it might be . What 'S the next step for them once they"
No," , but it should be for everybody and there 's many different ways of working , but one of the things i would address first of all is the shame like one of the impacts of trauma is shame , because children Are"
No," , because if you fought back what would happen , it just depends what age you are and no but uh , but as a young child . If you fi fight back on against the sexual abuser , all right , what would happen to you ? Who knows i mean it"
No," who do you want them to speak to me yeah now , if you found out that this happened to your child and your child never told you , how would You explain that , how would i explain it to how would you explain to yourself why my child is not"
Environment," talking to me about this terrible thing that happened ? Hmm , i would explain it by saying it 's something : i 'm not doing i 'm not creating a safe environment to allow this child to speak up , and that was your primary trauma yeah . So the sexual abuse is a"
Environment, confidence and security in your family of origin mmhmm . So that 's the primary trial right . That 'S that 's what that 's the first thing that happened yeah i mean that 's the case for sure . So to answer your question and if somebody comes to me with those issues um well
No, have the 12 step groups where they can actually talk about it and people ideally will not judge them . You know it 's a safe space to save space or you might have friends or you might reach out to a professional or you might have an intimate partner
No," uncle lewis , this guy did such and such to me and , and i 'm really scared and hurt , would you say to them ? Oh no , big deal , no ! Think of all the other kids that worst"
No," , and so when somebody says to me no big deal , you know i say : okay , take any other child in your position . Plug them into that situation and tell them it 's no big deal . Of course i would n't , but people do they do say these things"
No," , because they probably suppress the emotions themselves . I mean that 's . The whole point right is that they 're they 're not they 're not comfortable with the child 's pain because somebody 's crying they 're like i ca n't handle it right . They ca n't handle it yeah yeah , you"
No," in the book . I talk about the essential needs of children and one of them is that they 're , given the freedom to feel all their emotions , particularly sadness and grief and pain , also joy and everything else . But"
No," i do n't know if you 're comfortable talking about this . But what do you know about your dad 's childhood ? Oh man , yeah . It was messed up too yeah yeah . So this goes on from general , yeah yeah so and i feel like a lot of people"
No," struggle from the war from this or from The depression and and their parents suffered - and it was all about survival - it was n't about thriving yeah . So how do we break ? I guess the generational trauma , yeah and not . Let it pass down to our"
No," children so not being seen , is a major source of trauma . Just not being seen in general , just not being seen for who you are not being accepted for your abuse , yeah yeah yeah expect it to be different than who you"
No," , because i do n't think you 're gon na love me and accept me right and now more and more people are coming out . That 'S more , i would say it 's more acceptable right in most of america , in some communities and in america and some communities and it 's more talked about"
No, is that a symptom of something of a depression ? Is it natural ? What is all this that we can talk about ? So human being is a very complex creatures and with a little spectrum
No," identify with those genitalia . Is that a personality or identity , or is that a temperament or is that an actual like biological identity ? I i can tell you of one young relative that i have very close about this ."
Environment," , and i 'm curious from , i guess , uh your point of view or your practice is that a were they suppressed emotionally more as children ? Do they have the flourishing environment to be fully seen and express their wide range of emotions , or is that"
No," a you know ? No family is perfect and i do n't want to talk in detail about this family , but but uh they had a very loving parents , really loving grandparents . I witnessed it right um a lot of the qualities that we need for"
No," a good life . You know and like in any family . There are issues . Of course , no issues in the family would possibly explain this gender issue culture . This is much deeper in them . You know they were n't . You know no . This"
No," culture , it was n't anybody giving her propaganda . It was just how they were . It . Wasn'T bullies it was n't ? No , they had good friends . Yes , you know there was no issues like that , so it was n't trauma . Nah gotcha , it was n't drama"
No," in a lot of families like with a lot of gay men that i 've known um , they may not even have even if they 've realized their gayness , they suppressed it because of fear . They look like they 'd , be accepted or yeah , you"
No," anybody here . Anybody else here who suppressed important aspects of themselves - oh my god , for fear of not being accepted . 500 people put their hands . Oh my gosh , so this gay issue is one aspect of that . It 'S one manifestation of that . The"
No," that i was speaking . You know . I know the truth , but it is about the truth that i was thinking yeah yeah , but i discovered that yeah exactly you know . Well , that 's sort of that toxic masculine side . You know um , i 'm much more peace now , just like , if you"
Environment," and then they 're mirrored when the parent is attuned . When the child , when the parent recognizes and accepts and mirrors back the child 's feeling in a fee in in a context of safety , then the child says to themselves"
No," unconsciously , oh , i can be sad and i can be safe . At the same time , i do n't have to reject sadness , i can be vulnerable and i can be safe . At the same time , i do n't have to reject vulnerability when that mirroring is not there . The child loses the connection"
No," , really the the task is to become authentic . What would you say for every parent or soontobe parent uh that they should really focus on in creating for their children uh ? What would be the three things they"
No," that they are would set them up for more greater success , emotionally financially spiritually relationship wise if they could do these three things for their children ? Can i say five things give me five things . Please : okay , um !"
No," , so that so that deal with Your own stuff , first and and and and continue to deal with it as you have children , because you i guarantee you , your kids are going to trigger you . You know , and - and i did n't realize , that"
No," this year , yeah when you 're pregnant or when your partner 's pregnant , do your work already , because already the stresses of the husband during the pregnancy will affect that infant in the womb . The husband 's stresses will also affect"
No," yeah because the mom takes on the stresses of the partner right . So if you 're , stressing the mother you 're stressing the child exactly wow , okay , let 's work on yourself , that 's the first thing . Okay , then there are what"
No," a great psychologist friend of mine , gordon neufeld , and i there 's a chapter in this in the book - describes as the irreducible needs of children . The irreducible that , if you take them"
No," away , the child is going to be hurt . What are those needs ? Okay , first of all , a secure attachment relationship with the parents , but the child feels that he 's just welcome . She 'S welcome they 're , just welcome to be in the world in the presence of the parents"
No," , not because they 're pretty smart right just because they are just because they 're alive yeah . This is their life yeah , that 's the first one . The secondary also needs is what gordon calls rest , which means that , as a child"
No," to create peace for my parents , i can rest from the work of making the relationship work . That 'S the second irreducible need the third one . We'Ve already talked about . That 'S the freedom to experience all the emotions"
No," , joy grief , sadness , pain , anger and by the way , if you look at the brain , we have circuits for all this . The circuits for anger , the circuits for for caring , we have circuits for grief"
No," , bear cubs play you know , but play is essential for you for healthy brain development . Play is much more important for healthy brain development than intellectual learning uh . If a child plays they 'll be able to learn intellectually later so free"
No," , it 's ongoing . It goes on until you have kids yeah , so do the do the work yourself . First uh number two create uh the needs for your kids , which is a secure attachment . First off , so people feel secure yeah . The child feels secure that they just exist not to prove that"
No," they 're pretty enough or talented enough or smart enough or more advanced than other kids to get love , but just because they exist yeah yeah uh freed up the second one would be for rest yeah . So rest , meaning uh when you , when you 're resting you 're"
Environment," , not having to work right so not having to work to make the relationship work and with the parent , yeah yeah , gotcha um . The third one is the freedom to express all emotions , your full range of motions in a safe environment , yeah and then the"
No, He talks in the book about . Did he have those things ? Did he have those things with you ? No none of my kids . None of my children have had them . You know i i 've made every mistake in the book literally i made every mistake in every
No," book . I'Ve written you know about what not to do about what not to do yeah , so diana talks about he used to have his recurrent nightmare as a child of the floor just disappearing the floor not being the floor"
No," , which meant that he never knew when my wife And i would get into one of our really hostile tense exchanges and he had to sort of absorb and endure all that . Well , when the parents are in that state"
Environment," , the child does not feel secure . Now , if we lived in a large community like we used to with those uncles and aunts and grandparents around go next door , you hang out with your yeah yeah or you have safety somewhere go to the next cave or"
Environment," no . Thank god . We'Ve done a lot to heal our relationship and even writing . The book together was a a healing exercise . Sure let me tell you , but but you know going back to his childhood yeah . So when i point these things out"
No," , i 'm not pointing fingers at anybody . I i it 's hard and i i certainly had to learn a lot from the many ways in which i showed up that were n't helpful yeah yeah . It 'S interesting . I mean i could n't sleep at"
No," night for many , probably until i do n't even know until i was like in my late teens or late 20s . Probably i would stay up for hour hour and a half kind of just unable to sleep like . I would try to go to bed early , i would go to bed late and"
No," i would just kind of like anxiousness or worry or just an inability to fully rest yeah kind of always on this like edge yeah , and i think you know - and i never felt - That stability with my"
No," parents right it was like there was always some type of tension , yeah and , and it was like every other week . There was an explosion of like the slamming of doors and the screaming in the kitchen and we 're in the living room like yeah . When is the you know , when 's the"
No," I was , i went to a private boarding school okay because i went to a a christian camp one summer yeah and i met a bunch of kids that went to the school and i was like these kids are accepting these kids are kind . These kids are nice . These kids have joy , they 're loving . I was"
Environment," like i want to be around these kids . It feels safe . Yes , whereas i did n't feel like the school i was at before , and kind of the environment home felt safe yeah . I was like i begged them when i got back from this campus said . Please send me here to the school and they 're like"
Environment," environment with you , know , yeah , wake up and dress code and rules , but it was like probably some structure , probably something you 're welcome To structure i was like i thrived yeah , i mean some things i was resistant to , but i was also like i felt more safe with the order and"
No," the structure , and i was able to develop my mental and emotional skills and yeah . That discipline gave me a skill set too well . You know absolutely and going back to our discussion about that anger issue . I 'M not saying that parents need to be permissive ."
No," Permissiveness is a kind of neglect . What do you mean permissive permissive where the child just have to do whatever they want , and you know rage or whatever you know it 's not a question of that . It 'S a question of um ."
No," There has to be structure , there has to be rules and the parents have to set boundaries for their children and that 's what you probably appreciated in that yeah boarding school , because the rules and the boundaries were scary at home . It was like"
No," discipline . You know it was like anger rules exactly rather than like those yeah healthy rules and healthy boundaries where it 's like , hey , you know , put me in line if i need to be , but yeah not screaming at me . For my life , you know"
No," type of thing , yeah . That 'S interesting yeah , and so when , when when parents , when there 's tension within parents and there 's kids around and it 's a pattern , whether there 's a lack of affection , physical affection , a disrespect"
No," whether it 's loud or it 's just a lowlevel sense of arguments , what happens then to children ? If there 's that type of bickering arguing anger well , first of all , a number of things can"
No," happen . Once the child disconnects tunes out as a copy mechanism , then the brain gets wired to tune out . Okay , the child pushes down their emotions . As we talked about wow , all the chat takes"
No," if i told you about a fouryearold girl , who 's bullied by neighborhood kids and she runs into the family home to seek protection from the mother and the mother says there are no room for cards in this house . Now you get out there and deal with those kids . How would"
No," You view that interaction with the mom there 's no room for what no room for cards in this house , cowards , yeah the kid comes in the home too call me a coward . Go defend yourself , yeah , that 's a fouryearold before your google , i would say uh . How would i view that situation"
Environment," or that home ? How would you view that interaction with the mother ? I would view it as that 's how that mother was raised : yeah she 's , not creating a safe environment for the child . What 'S that , what 's the impact on their child"
No," suffering pain challenges , let me tell you an amazing thing : this story was told on public television in front of millions of people , and nobody thought there was anything wrong with that wow . This is hillary"
No," You know , and uh 60 years later , she gets pneumonia during the election campaign . Remember what she did with that . She collapsed in public , she had fever , she was dehydrated , she did n't tell anybody"
No," the nature becomes a culture . Yes , because a fouryearold girl who goes to mom for protection is not a coward she 's , a fouryearold . What would a little cat run back for protection ? You know wrong with a little bear . I mean"
No," yeah yeah , you know save me . Save me exactly help me that seeking help from the adults is the most natural urge of the child , so but in this culture we 'll be so glorified , sucking it up"
Environment," and come to us for safety and support , but also have the courage to manage challenging times in our life yeah so that we 're not always reliant on our parent when we 're 30 , but we 're also okay , we can take on"
Environment," challenges , see here 's the thing . Nature is an agenda . We talked about the oak tree before nature 's . The end is that you develop uh , will and selfrespect given the right environment"
No," you do n't do that to me to me . You do n't do that . How do you teach ? How do you show that to children ? How do you respect kids ? So they feel that and see it well , but by all the things all the ways that we we talked about and you know and and"
No," anger we have a circuitry in our brain for anger . As i said , there 's such a thing as healthy anger now um , which is very different from uncontrolled rage"
No," , healthy anger , simply says no , i mean you 're in my space , get out right . No animals have that yeah . You know it 's like the gorilla is just like you know . You get my space , you know under"
No," the cats . You know that that 's healthy anger , you know , uh , you know , look at a cat with a ambitious looking dog coming near them ."
No," Think about it forget about it . You know right um , that 's healthy anger . What 'S we do n't ? We ? Don'T have to teach it it 's there . We just allow it what 's uncontrollable rage . What 'S the difference when you uncontrollably is different and so here 's the thing the"
No," suppression of healthy anger , promotes autoimmune disease and neurological disease suppression of the health yep yeah , because anger is a boundary defense um , healthy anger is a body defense suppressing healthy anger , suppresses the"
No," immune System , because of the mindbody unity that again , this has been demonstrated yeah , so the mindbody entity says you suppress the anger , you 're suppressing your immune system . Your immune system may even turn against you"
No," right . Just like your anger can turn against you now . So that 's not healthy . Then there 's uncontrolled rage , which is also not healthy in in people who rage a lot , they 're more prone to have heart disease and strokes and high blood pressure ."
No," it splout spews out spills out yeah and i do n't know if you 've ever experienced rage . I have , of course , but you know what healthy anger is you 're on my space , get out : no , once it 's done its job , it 's over you 're"
No," , creating a a barrier or a boundary yeah , and it 's done its job . You move on exactly and the more i raged . The more circuits in my brain got recruited to be even more rateful , so that 's the so the healthy angers are in the present moment , bond defense . Unhealthy rage is"
No, present ? This always has to do with the past healing the memories of the past healing those stories . Yeah and is you know ? Sometimes we have a something a memory of the past
No," and we could either downgrade the the memory or we could elaborate the memory right . So how do we address the memory by allowing the feeling that 's associated with it to be present , in other words , by not being caught up with the story"
No," and just being with the emotions and accepting the emotions , which is really what should happen to you as a child , you know . So it 's not about the story . It 'S about what you 're experiencing when you 're"
No," you read what i say and if you do n't get to get it and then you have critically critiqued me for that ! Well , you got a problem here . You know of perception sure so that that 's one but the big one shows up in my relationship with my wife is as if"
No," , but i 'm i 'm really letting it go , and i 've let go of it majorly . Is there any sense of not being wanted from your wife , yeah yeah yeah yeah , any sense of not being wanted ? You know whether it 's physically or emotion , you know"
No," value of my existence ? You know so that 's so all suffering stems from what specifically do you think for us , some false belief that we developed about ourselves as a result of what"
No," if you , if you think you 're on titans , go , spend a week with your family , exactly exactly yeah um but listen . Let me say something : yeah um ! You were saying something that was so important and i wish i had kept it . What are we saying just now ? Just"
No," levine , who was a mentor and a friend , and he and i were just working together in switzerland and peter - and i were talking a year ago and he said he 's 80 years old now and he says um uh . He asked himself this question , am i doing enough"
No," of drug use . We have more people there and a few scrawlr radius using all kinds of drugs . These people are all terribly traumatized . All the women down there were sexually abused as a children . Many of them are indigenous canadians , which is a very traumatized segment of"
No," the canadian population , as it is here in the states , but they all so many of them said to me doc . If i ever get over this , if i ever beat this addiction , i 'm going to spend the rest of my life , making sure that other people do n't have"
No," and i remember being like man . Why is this ? You know i was addicted to that reaction . Yeah that anger feeling of like you 're gon na abuse me i 'm going to make sure it does n't happen right rage whatever i be right , there , yeah and uh that addiction"
No," triggering addictive rage moments . Yeah , i did n't feel any pain right . It was like there was so much adrenaline , yeah , there 's so much fight in me , yeah that it was like this is life or death feeling , and so i got a pretty bad fistfight"
No," yeah , but i would make sure i would always finish it if i needed to yeah . I remember at that point i was like my my best friend matt who 's in the room who i 've known for a long time . He was there with me and he goes . You"
No," friend , like called me out , he 's like i do n't know if i want to hang out with you like i 've , never played basketball with you again And you got ta figure out why you 're reacting to someone yeah talking trash yeah , we 're supposed to have fun here"
No," what that story brings up for me is um . You had this fit of rage . No , but i was a loving fun guy . Unless i felt like , i was being taken advantage of yeah , which is what happened to the child , but what else did we talk about ? Having fits"
No," i 'll just notice , It and smile you know , kind of okay , that 's just about them , it 's yeah and i 'll . Just and i , and i 'm so connected to it , the vision of my future and my present , but my vision , my values"
Environment," suppressed . Yeah . There 'S a lot of political trauma and um . How does someone who maybe is living in a stressed environment , whether it be their home or their city or their culture"
Environment," , political ? You know whatever it might be : they 're they 're more suppressed than others . How can they support themselves to getting out of a stressed environment so that they can be more of a baseline to have the ability to thrive and flourish"
No," oprah and it might have been the same guy but go ahead all right . Well , my point is that fairness . My point is that it did n't that it was n't destroyed by it right . He started to heal in the prison and he he found the inner strength somehow so that"
No," it 's not for me to tell i do n't know if i could stand it for one day , never mind for four decades or three decades , but but that just shows you that The strength the capacity to heal and to hold on to one servant to find oneself is actually"
No," of living , yeah personal research . I had the uh scientific research yeah and i think um . This is the type of stuff people need the most is understanding how to understand their pain , their trauma , their suffering , yeah and find solutions , yeah"
No," , but i 'm so grateful for your doing this , so the myth of normal . I want everyone to get a few copies and give it to your friends and then to subtitle the trauma , illness and healing in a toxic culture , exactly which is what we 've been talking about . You know we"
No," have n't even talked about social media consumption and ipads and iphones , and all that stuff just being on electronics all day how that 's probably affecting traumatizing us in certain ways . It 'S actually distorting the brain development of children"
No," and or and and this year another psychiatrist , uh , bruce perry , wrote a book with oprah called what happened to you , the fact that these books are now um , so many books in the top 10 bestsellers yeah people are waking up yeah . So i 'm just glad to be able to"
No," remember your yeah , your information yeah . What would you say are those three truths for you seek the reality of everything : do n't do n't get um seduced by appearances or anything"
No," second would be um , do n't be afraid of your pain and do n't run away from it , because that running away is what leads to addictions And illness , and so on number three : it 's all worth it it 's worth going"
No," through all that suffering uh , because this is what life is it 's just worth being alive . A friend of mine in england recently lost a very close friend to suicide . She was"
No," just struck by overwhelmed by grief and she did n't know she could handle it and then she 's got a favorite forest that she walks in . She told me this like two months ago or a month ago , she went to walk in this first"
No, and she just felt this deep grief . Our grief is one of the brain circus that we have . We have circuits for grief . We have to . She felt this deep brief and she felt the greatest joy at the
No," same time and asked her well , how are the two even compatible ? She said i felt the grief and if it 's such joy at the privilege of being alive to feel the grief , wow yeah , it 's all worth it , it 's so worth it ."
No," facing the pain and the trauma fully yourself and being on the healing journey and for your com , consistent dedication to creating your work so that people can consume it in a way that resonates with Them from"
No," People are dying from lack of hope , death of despair when you take away people 's sense of agency you 're , taking away the most core dynamic of who you are as a human being , i think you got ta have a dream : the school of greatness yeah . Please welcome ."
No," Thank you , i 'm ! So excited to be talking to you lewis , it 's great thank you , and - and i am i love - that you 're in this field of understanding the mind brain connection and how it plays into our thoughts and our emotions , our feelings , our mental health and everything else is"
No," are actually thinking feeling and choosing you 're alive and your aliveness is your mind and your mind . Is this ability that of what you 're doing right at this moment as you 're listening to me , you are processing the auditory , sound waves , the"
No," and that 's the thinking feeling choosing the psychological version and the the sciencey version is this gravitational field . So it 's a little bit like a magnet . This is a super , easy way to understand it . If you imagine a piece of white paper and you put a whole lot of iron filings"
No," primary source ? You never stop . Thinking your mind is always going you wake up with your mind , you eat with your mind , you choose your clothes with your mind , you 're doing the podcast with your mind , you go to sleep with your mind . So mind is the source and if you do n't"
No," perfect uh . So how wide can this so the mind ? Your thinking , your ideas , your thoughts is a field , an energetic field yeah around you inside of you , uh , connected through your whole body and"
No," friends and they 're so totally depressed and you come away from there thinking i feel awful . I need to go and have a shower . You feel so so they their field has interacted with yours and impacted you , because those feel that that field is coming from your"
No," , healthy , green tree and here 's a toxic one . So this would be a toxic . You know the depression or whatever you know , being negative or whatever , that would generate toxic photons , and these are the ones that would make you . You know you feel it . You feel that negativity . This is"
No," an atom . You know particles change according to their waves and in their particles only when you actually look at them . So it 's it 's considered the observer effect and it 's really interesting because it means that we have these waves of energy and , as we"
No," make a choice , we create reality , which we do so , as you think feel and choose you change your brain because everything every time you Choose think feel and choose those three things always go together . Always thinking always thinking means you 're , always feeling thinking and"
No," , which is an inconceivable speed . So what i 've done with my work is to try and understand this . You know what is the thought and what is memory and what is mind and what is brain and how do they interact and how do they influence and and do we have any sense of agency over"
No," how to kind of you know work around it , and so that 's just and compensate more of a compensation kind of philosophy . So i remember thinking in one of my neuroscience lectures that this does not work for me because we 're changing and growing as humans . So i said no i 'm going"
No," : okay , it 's traumatic brain injury once someone 's had a traumatic brain injury , and i mean your dad went through one yeah . That 'S it pretty much ! That 'S you know written off and um . We were trained , as i said , to compensate . So i said : okay well"
Environment," this is like it really ages me . Doesn'T it go back into those ? I worked through the apartheid era , the transition and the postpartum era . So i was seeing all the socioeconomic trauma the racism trauma , and i worked in that three days a week in those environments with terrible"
No," , death life happens , but how you manage it - and you i mean your case - is a classic example . Your life was thrown upside down and your family 's life was sewn upside down and you managed your mind and got yourself back going . So you were doing this concept"
No," growing ? Are you satisfied as a person are you you know , that 's the sort of way we want to go as opposed to this very externalized version of it . So yeah wow um . This is it 's really powerful ."
No," around us , necessarily just how we respond , like you said . So how do we learn to reframe our mind or rewire our mind and so that we can have inner peace when there is trauma or pain around us brilliant question ? It 'S a skill that we"
No," learn . So that 's really nice to know the sooner the it 's never too late to start , but the sooner we start the better . So i have four adult children . They learned this . They grew up with the stuff and , as i 've learned new things , they 've been my lab rats . So they 've been trained and"
No," literally at my husband and they all work for me by the way they 're either they 're , either all amazing , kids or messed up kids totally yeah yeah we 'll have to ask the question : well dominic 's my producer , so i think she 's sort of doing . Okay , there , but you know the thing"
No," : the biggest thing with the mind and managing mind lewis is to accept that depression anxiety , even the scary words like bipolar and schizophrenia , and then going to the mood sort of things like that we can accept , grief , anger , etc . These are not illnesses ."
No," the bad stuff go away , but to know how to live in the bad Stuff , because it 's not going away so despair , anger , depression , anxiety . These are all completely normal responses . In fact , they 're very helpful they 're , helpful messengers and warning signals as opposed to being scary"
No," research purposes , and i happened to while i was wearing it Because you wear it and then you , you know , you track your levels and i wanted to see for in terms of mental health and the neuro cycle that i 've developed . I wanted to see the"
No," impact and i happened to be going through experience , a very acute torment of family over december and in the moment of the trauma i happen to see on my glucose monitor that my glucose had shot up to 240 . Now that 's heart attack level"
No," to a mind thing , a thought , which is the consequence of mind . Think field choose you build thoughts . Thoughts are made of roots and trees , branches , which are the memory , so thoughts are made of . Memories like trees are made of branches . This is toxic . It will stimulate the same"
No," do n't deal with those patterns in our life that we are in in acting um - that 's a constant arguments or these certain . You know they all have these toxic patterns . Well , no one 's immune , we all and and the signals of those are things like depression and anxiety and those are"
No," represents someone who 's totally depressed , flatline brain flatline literally , and this person 's all their biomarkers were absolutely in cortisol , inflammation , etc . But this shows that the energy levels in the brain are very flat . Blue means a very , very"
No," depressed . This person was their narrative , was tremendous trauma in their life . They were offline , they were battling with um work relationships , a lot of stuff everything was off . Everything was off sleep , you name it . They were at like 3d to check out what"
No," age was in their mid30s , but they biologically 70 or something yes , a sickly , 70 year old . That 'S crazy within a crazy within nine weeks of mind management . No , i did n't work on . I do n't use drugs . I did n't . I do talk about diet and stuff , but in this particular"
No," clinical trial was pure mind management . Just the neuro cycle , just get your mind under control and that gray means that they 're brain stabilized that the brain waves that they were actually managing . So here they were saying . I am depression , i am"
No," hopeless all the biomarkers dna here they saying i felt i now know why i feel depression , i 'm not depression . I now know why and depression is simply a signal of an underlying cause . It 'S not who i am it 's not an it . It 'S not an illness by 63 days"
No," sleeping 25 improvement in sleep and i mean all kinds of like their relationships , not suicidal anymore , and i mean that 's , i can go on and on and on wow . This subject over here was in the control group , so they got no mind management and what you 'll see is a lot"
Environment," change your telomeres , which are your markers for aging and for health , mental health and physical health , and that 's pretty unusual , because most of the work on telomeres has been done around diet and exercise which are basically like . You know leafy greens and plantbased"
No," , exactly which is significant and also there 's been some work on meditation , but there 's been no . No . I think this is the first study . That 'S been done on actually doing the deliberate intentional mind , work to change , and then we saw significant drops"
No," to be okay and at peace with having moments of depression and actually looking for the message and seeing them as helpful . We have this really weird philosophy which has been about 40 years in the west . Now , where we look at depression and"
No," anxiety and those kind of things as illnesses and neuropsychiatric brain diseases and as bad symptoms that we must suppress like cancer symptoms , you must suppress , so it 's been lumped or misery of life has been medicalized . To quote a new , a a brilliant psychiatrist"
No," , um and uh , jo anna moncrief , so we 've got to really watch out for that , but actually the the real truth is that those depression and anxiety are not illnesses . They are just survival instincts . It 'S telling you hey pay attention . There 'S something going on : you"
No," there is n't a mental health disease , it 's more of just a a pattern that or something that we should be mindful of , but it 's not an actual disease ? No , it 's not a disease , and i know this counters this count as the current philosophy . But if you look at"
No," depression , and for years we 've been told about the serotonin imbalance causing depression , i mean that 's not even it was a theory , never proven great for marketing , for you know , foodsealing drugs and also the simplistic way of telling someone hey"
No," you depressed . Don'T worry , it 's chemical imbalance , let me give you a drug to fix it . You know we want this quick fix mentality so with , as medicine has advanced and technology has advanced , so we 've become very caught up in the quick fix and but life 's not"
No," like that mind is not like that mind is separate from brain and body . You can apply that kind of thinking , not quick fix , but you can apply a symptomatic diagnosis , treatment approach to body to physical , brain and body , but when it comes to mind"
No," , that 's that this is this gravitational field is force . This think feel choose thing . It 'S not going to go . You know . Medication is not going to change how you 're thinking feeling and choosing it 's not going to get rid of this . It 'S just going to numb your brain . So"
No," maybe you do n't feel this for , while it 's working , but at the same time as then , when that drug wears off this is still there . This is still being recognized by the immune system of your brain as a problem , so this is increasing your bone . The longer"
No," pandemic is mental health . We , if mental health has always been an issue known as from the beginning of time . Mankind has battled with life , with issues with death , with fighting with war with whatever , so mental health is not on the rise , but the mismanagement of mental"
No," , you you chop up to 10 years , more of their life . You know it 's like it 's adding on they 've shown . Studies of people with a mental health diagnosis have a choppy 20 years of up to 20 years off their lifespan , people on psychotropic drugs"
No," off people 's lives , but there 's such a contradiction because they 're saying hey , this is adverse circumstance : grief of loss of people , uncertainty , medical and you know not knowing if you 're going to live or die . And how long is this isolation going to go on and economic"
No," in their life have and will be anxious and depressed and in grief and sadness , and terror and despair , and one of the others , a large percentage of the population and i 'm not sure the exact percentage . Because no one 's really done this kind"
No," , it 's they coping they . How do you deal with this ? Of course , you 're going to be angry , you 're going to be frustrated , you 're not going to be able to love like you did . You have to be able to embrace process and reconceptualize giving them a drug is not going to make it not going"
No," going to that 's not going to facilitate change . We have to do something . So it 's like a narrative . Do you feel like there i mean ? Is there such a thing as a chemical imbalance in some people uh ? You know when they say : oh , i have a depression , it 's a disease or bipolar , or"
No," i have this mental health disease or i have a chemical imbalance . I was treated with this . Don'T try to say i do n't , because this is who i am is that do some people have that , or is that that 's the result ? The narrative of i have a chemical"
No," imbalance in my depression is from chemical imbalance is a narrative that is the only explanation that people have been given they 're . Not given an alternative reaction . I mean an alternative narrative , so the most important thing is that"
No," anyone listening to this podcast , i want to validate your depression , your anxiety , your grief , your despair , your ptsd , whatever label you 've been given . I want you to . I want to validate that . That does n't need to be validated with a disease label you 're , not diseased you 're"
No, thing here is to recognize that chemical imbalance is n't the cause of your despair . The cause of your despair is what you 've gone through and what you 're going through and learning how to and not knowing how to manage it and how to deal with those thoughts that are
No," inside of you , the scary thing , that 's controlling you and i that invalidates if i , if someone comes back from war , someone 's had a sexual trauma to tell them that the depression or anxiety , they 're feeling is An illness is"
No," an insult to what they 've gone through , but if i say , if i say to you , gosh , that 's terrible , tell me about it . I want to hear your story . I want to support you , your depression and anxiety . That you 're feeling is a signal that there 's stuff"
No," 15minute appointment where i can give you a label that takes time . That 'S not also , it 's also not the conditioning kind of treatments that are in place that some of them work , if they 're used in the right place , but to try and to try and put a veteran who 's gone"
No," , plus y , and so here we are in our x situation , where we as a sort of human experiencing life , we 're supposed to be at y And you put the two together and what the current treatment says is that okay , now we 're going to create z , we 're just"
No," traumatic event in the family . You had recently where you 're wearing a glucose monitor , and you mentioned that there was a process . You realized , like the amount that went through the roof heart palpitations stress . You could feel your physical"
No," , your body , changing into this stress response . This protection tightness whatever it was . Yeah fear anxiety all these . These things you were experiencing in the moment . What was the process that you broke down to bring it back to more normal levels for yourself of feeling"
No," it 's been refined over the years . This is the most updated research . So a good scientist should keep learning and changing and improving , which is what i 've tried to do so in this book is the updated version of the neurocycle . The"
No," neurocycle is how you get your mind , which is always working under control if , in a state of acute trauma like we were like , i was in that moment , acute tumor creates a red brain . I showed you that picture of a red brain that red brain means that i have a tidal wave in my"
No," - i 'm not gon na have any wisdom , i 'm gon na fall apart and in this situation i would have and um - and i have in the past , but now i 've learned how to deal with this , and i talk about that . This new cycle can improve how you manage anxiety and depression by 81 . That 'S a massive"
No," mind with all these trees and this acute tumor has just grown because it 's instant , so here 's this terrible and your helicopters drawn to this because you are in shock and terror and fear and deep panic and anxiety . That is all the smoke signals . So i at my my"
No," signals . So the despair anxiety , whatever panic attack , then you gather awareness of your physical bodily response . So here 's your copart of saying , okay , how are you feeling gather that apple gather that apple ? What is your physical flattering"
No," in the heart ? Panic attack tension , gutwrenching adrenaline fly for whatever flights in front freeze mode , you 're in then your behaviors . What are you saying ? What are you doing ? You know i mean i was responding . How are you responding yeah action yeah ? What 'S what"
No," anxiety and trauma , and i mean and the dexa depression . Those scary do n't be scared of them because they are messengers , they 're , helpful messengers that are telling you something , and if you respond to them in that way , you then control them . But if you respond to them"
No," in fear , they control you yeah and then you 're not going to move forward , you 're going to get very stuck and then stuck in rumination and the patterns will just get worse so get the control . Even though you can you can be crying"
No," it so they 're now working sequentially through the process , so they 're going to Have to start finding why ? What does it track back to what level ? What sort of selfesteem issues are ? What is the origin story of it , so that the reflect in that case would be , you know , ask"
No," um . So essentially , you would do it for around 15 to 45 minutes a day when you 're fixing up the big stuff , and you would do it louis , the big stuff you would do for 63 days . So that 's why why 63 glad you asked that so we 've all been told 21 days to build"
No," build a beautiful new house . You still remember how it was , but you 've reconceptualized it you 're living in that new space . You remember the old okay . So that 's what i 'm talking about that takes 21 days , so you create to break down and build a thought with memories"
No," , because the thought is a tree made of memories . Memories are what like a tree 's made of branches . Thoughts are made of memories , so to make something . That 'S got a level of sustainability takes about 21 days and in that 21 days after that , if you"
No," stop there , it 's a tiny little plant in your forest . It does n't have enough energy to move from the nonconscious mind no n , the nonconscious mind operates 24 7 . It 'S where all your experiences are stored in thoughts . All your belief systems you 're nurturing"
No," , wired for love , stuff , optimism , bias and then everything we experience in life is around the edge little trees , big trees , dark trees , green trees , the smaller The tree , the newer , the experience with the newer , the memory , the weaker the memory that big established trees , are the ones"
No," view something it has to have more energy put into It energy is never lost . Energy is transferred quantum physics talks about energy . These things are proteins with energy vibrating in the little protein structures . So you want that they 're weak , so you 've got to"
No," to do it and then you 're building your strength and you 're turning it into behavior change . So to go around you know , the theme of your podcast and to get to greatness requires behavior change , so real behavior change . If you really want to build a good habit into your life"
No," neuroscience say behind positive thinking versus negative or toxic thinking , and i i think this i do n't know what the status is . Sixty 000 thoughts a day or something like that we have and 80 or 90 of them are the same recurring"
No," multiple , maybe a hundred memories in that . So these that 's that 's . 120 odd things happening in any 10 second block and multiply that by 60 seconds you know or some six so in one minute , so you can really see the numbers as they multiply . So"
No," your front door and they 're trying to bash your frontal down and you 've , got your family to protect you 're , going to pay attention . You'Re not going to watch tv you 're going to pay attention to what 's catching . What 'S what 's a threat to your survival ? That 'S why we ! So it 's"
No," not that we have more negative thoughts , we 're not thinking ! I need to fix this , we 're that 's we 're just relaxing and hanging out , but it 's when there 's a thought . That 'S negative ! We put a lot of attention on exactly it 's the big tree in the forest . It 'S"
No," , something or if you 're , living in an abusive situation or you 're living in with a bullying boss or you living under the threat of someone in your family who's really ill that's what's going to Dominate so it 's not that we have more negative thoughts , it 's because that is"
No," and your attention is to go fix . So if we suppress so if we suppress in terms of what not pay attention not be aware , yeah medicaid take drugs uh drink whatever the addiction is , as opposed to address it . What happens well so , essentially , i 'm glad you brought"
No," always draw on that internal survival instinct , which is that internal strip of green trees just for the analogy sake , so Addiction is n't a disease . Addiction is a response like depression . It 'S a warning signal . It 'S trying to take something , that 's painful and taking something to"
No," numb the pain . So , as you said , the sex , the pornography , the um , the alcohol , the drugs , the smoking yeah , so you often find exactly so . If you find someone who was talking to someone yesterday who had a tremendous um battle with cocaine and alcohol ."
No," But it was n't that those that grabbed them . We get the impression that oh , your brain 's diseased , therefore you 're vulnerable to those and you ca n't control it nonsense . That 'S taken all the hope . People are dying for , like from lack of hope . Louis , that 's that 's what that"
No," statistic . I spoke about earlier the reversal of trends . People are dying from lack of hope , death of despair when you take away people 's sense of agency you 're , taking away the most core dynamic of who you are as a human . Your mind is all about agency , think feel : choose you"
No," control that and you remove that agency from someone by saying hey . You ca n't control the fact that you 're addicted to alcohol or that you 're addicted to that 's terrible . But if you say okay , i see that that is where you 're finding your coping"
No," strategy at the moment that having the alcohols now in the pain having take it . Having the you know , the pornography , the the repeated , whatever the abuse of whatever abuse of anything to to to hide the opioid addiction . It 'S it 's just to numb the pain . So once"
Environment," a person is in a loving supportive environment , where they can start seeing that change , then they can start and see why , then you can take them through the process of okay . Well , let 's see , maybe that signal has got a cause and , let 's"
No," start finding and when you start working through the neurocycle they i can tell you now most of the time they 're still addicted to something because the pain 's so bad and they 're denying . This is a disease because it 's easier to accept that initially , but they deny no , i do n't"
No," i 'm not addicted to alcohol . I know i 'm not addicted to to whatever the cocaine i 'm not addicted , but once you start lovingly showing them okay . Well , let 's talk about forget about"
No," to say . Oh , i see i 've been trying to numb my pain and then you can start getting the release 86 to 93 percent of people that are addicted , get out of addiction through choice and that choice is stimulated by a supportive as a super supportive , loving"
Environment," environment . That is helps people to see what 's going on , because it 's very hard to face that stuff . So we can live in a state of denial and so that 's what takes a lot of good , supportive and good therapy and good"
Environment," environments . You know supportive environments , but to tell someone , i 'm always an addict , it 's one of the worst things you can say : you 'd say : okay , you have no power right right , i 'm a victim to this chemical imbalance or whatever it might be yeah . But that 's not the case"
No, That person had been raped multiple times as a child about came from a very wealthy family and the babysitter who looked after him when he was parents were so busy working was repeatedly raping this child through his childhood and then got . I mean it happened again at
Environment, university and this and this and different work environments and and in different parts of the world when he traveled to different parts of the world and that 's where so he had to get to the point where he realized he was numbing . The
No," pain you know , so that 's so , if you can , you see , we have to shift the narrative absolutely . You know that this is , and these are extreme cases , but there 's also the daytoday i mean we 've got to live with ourselves . Someone the other day said to me . Well , that 's all and well"
No," relationship big extreme . What about just sitting here with myself ? And i ca n't sleep at night and i 'm worrying about , like you know the things that are n't i can still get through life , but i 'm ruminating and i 'm overthinking and i 'm stuck in anger . And you know"
No," that 's that too . We'Ve got to manage all of that , and that was my that was 25 years of my life , because i i talked about being sexually abused when i was five and having anger and resentment and frustration and rage for 25 years until i was until i"
Environment," the environment of love , support and peace to begin the path of setting me free setting the pain and the trauma free by giving it a voice by expressing it by beautiful , doing the work , and it did n't happen overnight . It 'S like eight years"
No," thinking when toxic thoughts about ourselves ? I 'M not good enough i 'll , never amount to anything . I should n't try this . This person does n't , like me , drama stress , anxiety , whatever it is , when we have a toxic thought that does n't support our dreams , it does n't support"
No," the betterment of our future and our vision . What should we be thinking in terms of replacing that in terms of the process , or is that something we should n't be rejecting negative thoughts ? We should be analyzing and being aware , but how do we"
No," in the helicopter , whichever point when you 're , in is to say it 's : okay , it 's okay , there 's been a million billion people who have been in the same position As you that are battling , in fact , most people battle with selfesteem , it 's very few people that do n't for some reason"
No," battle with selfesteem , for example . Just take that example thinking . I ca n't do this or i am ashamed , because every toxic experience we have completely rips at the core of who we are and the core of who we are is i 'm needed . I 'M valuable and i have"
No," something to contribute to the world that no one else can contribute . So when someone tries to take that away from you through an abuse or that is has to attack the core of you . So you kind of hide amongst shame and , and selfesteem comes out of this , i"
No," should n't be feeling this , but if especially a young child like five to be abused , you do n't know how to process that . So the most immediate thing is because it 's so against survival , because the adult in your life , if you 're supposed to be the protector"
No," create a pervasiveness of shame and that comes out in all kinds of behavioral manifestations , whether it 's withdrawal , whether it 's being difficult , aggressive and it 's pervasive , and that That attacks selfesteem , because something at the core of you always been attacked , and"
No," and see those as very helpful . It 'S a complete 90 degree or 360 degree change , despair , anxiety , shame thinking ! I am shame thinking . I have no selfesteem thinking . I ca n't do this . That 'S okay , because , as soon as you say , that 's okay , as soon as you can admit , you 're feeling"
No," hits around between 18 22 early childhood trauma where we start seeing those patterns manifesting and a bit of awareness . Coming so now that when this comes into consciousness in the brain , this thing is now weakened . So these protein branches , which are the memories"
No," and the emotions , the data of the event , which was that right , is now weakened . So the minute i through my tears , say : okay , i 'm i feel i feel shame i feel like i 've got no selfesteem . I feel like i 'm useless and i 'm ugly and i 'm this and"
No," , it 's the most scary , challenging thing i 've ever emotionally had to deal with and it feels like you 're dying . I do n't know i mean - maybe that 's too extreme , maybe it 's too extreme , but i think you 're thinking or"
No," feeling like i 'm going to die , because if i processed this - and if people knew this about me yeah , how could they ever accept me ? How could they ever love me ? I 'M going to be alone for the rest of my life . Like your mind , my mind went through these"
No," you know crash the plane as a time capsule . You can get that plane going again , but helping leaning on the power and the comfort of the copilot to say . I 'M really scared of that . I do n't want to land my plane , you"
No," the traumas , the memories of the past , that we had from the event and we 're holding on to the memory . The idea , the thought of the event , and sometimes we we and a lot of the times i would go to say uh . You know i 'll speak for myself and"
No, i 'm thinking most of us probably an event happens and our memories after decades and years build it up into something bigger and more extreme potential yeah the event actually was and we 're holding on to now . Our mind is coming up with memories that
No," were n't even real , that caused this reaction in us . So how do we really ? Is it healing the trauma of the past ? Is it healing the memory of the past ? Is it healing all of it ? What is the process ? What should we do is ?"
No," will definitely help , but therapy is a catalyst . It 'S not actually and it 's a place where you can unpack the pain and get the guidance for how to manage the next step , but you 're still living with yourself . 24 7 . You'Ve got to do the work , and this is"
No," where having a system of mind management is so vital . So what you 've described is the whole thought tree and that thought tree . Let 'S take the incident of what you went through as a child , and that would have been you know what the actual incident would have"
No," the data and that manifested in how you actually lived your life . So that 's a trauma from the past . There 'S no guilt in this , even though it 's toxic , because that 's all you could do to survive it 's a coping mechanism . So this toxic tree is a"
Environment," that you 're still surviving , but things are getting worse and worse and eventually that eventually this cocoon starts breaking down and it explodes in mentally physically in something in a relationship in a work environment in a it builds it cascades and little things"
No," has to the past has to go for want of an awful analogy , but it 's a good example at some point . You could ca n't stay there anymore and that 's when it explodes and when it explodes . These are all the memories , as you recall it , this is the concept of the abuse as a child . That 'S"
No," , because a lot of people keep getting stuck because they think i ca n't forgive . I ca n't forgive . How can i forgive someone who 's ? How do you forgive someone who 's raped you ? How does your parents forgive someone who 's hurt their child ? You know how do you , how does that ?"
No," the religious community forgiveness . It 'S all gone , it 's all gone away , it has n't it 's still there . It 'S part of your story . I think the kinsugi principle explains it the best . You know the kinsugi principle , the japanese art . You know when a vase"
No," shatters to the ground and it 's in a thousand pieces , they do n't sweep the pieces away when you were raped as a child . Your life was shattered , okay , but you did n't sweep the pieces away every what they did was they collect every piece and they"
No," teaching others , you have you as a leader are one of the three percent only that are enabling others to talk about their trauma . Only three percent of leaders are talking about mental health , three percent globally , that 's terrible wow ! So if we as leaders , do n't talk about it , how"
No," mental health ? On a daily basis , whether we 've it sounds like first , we need to be aware of into the process of healing the past or the the traumatic memories of the past . However , you want to call it , but what 's the process of protecting the present in the future so that we do n't"
No," I do n't know what it is um every . I thought i had the page open every 10 seconds . You can be consciously aware of what you 're thinking , feeling and choosing mental peace and keeping yourself in a state of mental peace comes from being aware , every 10 seconds"
No," now i 'm not asking you to set your watch and your time on your phone . I 'M just saying that translate that out : it means all the time that , as when you 're awake , you need to be standing back and observing your own thinking . You need to be thinking , okay . What am i thinking in"
No," Your selfregulation skills are trained to a level where it changes your life . I honestly , if i had to sell what would say say what protects my mental health . It 'S my increased selfregulation from constantly living a life of neurocycling , then the other"
No," thing in the neuro cycling that is phenomenal for protecting mental health , which no one speaks about . I do n't know anyone except me , speak about this and it 's called brain building and there 's a whole section in the book on brain building and that 's taking the five"
No," you do n't use them , they become toxic waste . So that affects your sleep at the end of the day and affects your dreams and cumulatively , over time they affect your health of your brain . So when you , when you brain , build it 's like cleaning"
No," by learning something , we actually think deeply that when you neuro cycle to brain build , what i 'm doing is getting you to think super deeply and when you think deeply you make all these great things Happen in the brain , the left , right , side , oxygen and all that stuff and"
No," you and that 's the only way you can actually grab those new those new baby dendrites . They respond to deep thinking . They do n't respond to shallow thinking . They do n't respond to scanning through headlines and hurry , sickness and rush rush rush and data capturing and never"
No," can do more , do more and you will transform your mental health , all my patients when they came into my practice , i would obviously evaluate and do all that kind of thing we work out sort of where the issues were , but we would always do brain Building first , sometimes"
No," for a few sessions , i would only do brain building and get them to a state where i could recognize they 're starting to get more resilient and selfregulated . Then we would start doing the trauma , work and the learning disability work and the work with"
No," trauma . You know working with traumatic brain injury . We would and in fact all the traumatic brain , injury and stroke work that i would do with my patients like if i was working with someone like what your dad went through , i would teach the the patient and the family brain"
No," building we would take . What are you interested in and like if your dad was interested , let 's say whatever ? Let 'S say he was interested in , i do n't know what was your dad interested in to uh playing piano , singing sports running yeah ? Okay , so you"
No," study study it do the brain building enough to immediately increase my resilience . Does brain building only happen when you 're , studying and learning something , or is it more of like ? Okay , i 'm going to play like ping pong or play a sport or do an"
Environment," activity to help like hand eye coordination . Yes , no definitely you can do that too . So ping pong is fantastic for the brain . You know anything that really challenges the brain to coordinate is definitely going to be a brain building exercise . So you know"
No," parents in general : do n't have the tools to have conversations with their kids around mental health um . You know , i do n't remember much of my parents , although they 're amazing , i do n't remember us talking about mental health and um these . These challenges that might"
No," I love your question and it 's so important . We should be doing this from babies so when a child comes home from school and they 're , maybe three or four years old and they sad they do n't have the language but to be able to actually notice and validate . I see you feeling"
No," sad . Why are you sad and what you know giving toys to be able to act out the older they get , never overlook a child 's emotion , always validate . I see you sad . Do you want to talk about it ? I see you so it 's it 's . I see you , you notice , i 'm saying i see you and you can find your"
No," mental messes all the time , but it 's very important . Not if someone your child comes to you and says i i 'm really worried and and then you say what are you worried about - i 'm worried about this one doing something that you think is"
No," totally irrelevant . Oh , that 's , not so bad ! You do n't have to worry about that . That is the worst thing you can do to your child , because what you 've done is invalidate something that for them is now they feel shame . So now , they 've got um this confusion of worry . They do n't"
No," to use neurocycling for children and i 'm writing i 've written books in the past . But now we 're doing the updated versions of neurocycling for benny tots neurocycling for young kids , teenagers , whatever so exactly how to have the"
No," conversations , but it 's openness , one of the things that i have as a parent , um and i 've i mean i 've worked with . I used to do a lot of family therapy when i practice and as a the advice i always give parents , and that i 've tried to apply as much as possible is keep your"
Environment," environment open . Keep it no matter what your kids , your kids , want to talk to . You about sex and and things that you do n't want to talk about . If you do n't want to talk about them , they 're going to talk about them somewhere else , and that goes for emotions too . We'Ve got to allow our"
No," kids to say . I am feeling depressed the other day . Someone said : how do i help my child , not be a professor of depression and it was quite an interesting way of phrasing . It and my response to that was well help them process it . If they 're a"
No," professor of depression , what can you learn from them if they , if you feel that they are so good at depression , these that 's a symptom or a signal of something going on ? You need to acknowledge that and say i see you feeling depressed . Can you explain more"
Environment, and then work through the whole get those you know the five steps work through it systematically ? You can use a lot of visuals with kids . I mean i 've been doing this with kids when i was practicing and training in schools and things as young as three and
No," child for no reason , and then you feel guilt and condemnation . That 'S do n't do that if you get mad , explain why you 're mad say i 'm really mad . I 'M sorry . I said the wrong thing i was . I did n't mean to do that . This is why i did it"
No," , but the thing that you must n't let a child grow up . Oh you 're , the mother you chose to have me . Therefore , you 've got to be perfect and if you fell , you 've messed up my life forever , that 's not healthy for a child and that 's what happens and it 's bad for the parent and the child"
No," and or the parents pretending . Oh no everything 's , fine and you know , meanwhile , behind close doors . You and your husband are having a huge fight or you and your wife are having that 's so confusing . When my husband and i have an argument , we , the kids , grew up , knowing why we explained"
No," still cries . My dad still gets upset , but they 've got a management plan . So it 's that authenticity and honesty does that answer the question . Absolutely uh . I'Ve got a couple final questions for you . This has been fascinating , um really inspired by all this , and i ca n't"
No," wait to dive in more in the book cleaning up your mental mess . Five simple , scientifically proven steps to reduce anxiety , stress and toxic thinking , so make sure you guys get the book if you have n't got it yet . This is going to be really powerful and helpful for you for"
No, a family member for a friend so make sure to check this out really inspired by this um you 've been doing this work for what three decades now nearly fought 38 years now
No," , the main the mind , thoughts , thinking memory , all this stuff . What 'S the challenge you still face as a human being with four decades of experience , the the the challenge that"
No," personally it 's i wish . I could manage it 24 7 and that 's my goal because i know it works and when it does - and i get totally frustrated when i think why did n't i just use the neuro cycle , it 's got to the point in our family , where , if i would like , i Actually went to my"
No," husband yesterday , i was really like worked up about something he said . Well , why are n't you neuro cycling ? I 'M just like . Don'T say that to me . I do n't feel like neurocycling i want to . I just want to have a moan . You know that kind of thing , but yeah essentially it 's true"
No," because i had to . I actually got myself back under control , so my greatest the greatest hard , the probably the hardest thing to do is to to watch um people in pain when i know that they can that there 's a way out - and i wish i"
No," too shall pass when you know how to manage it . So that 's yeah , that 's for me , a big challenge and in terms of globally uh the narrative of mental health . We just have to stop telling people that they are brain damaged when they are just being normal humans . That 'S a huge"
No," challenge . This is awesome . I 'M really glad we had this conversation um . Thank you so much . This question i ask everyone towards the end is called the three truths question . So i 'd like you to imagine it 's your last day on earth , many years away from now , and you get to"
No," of the minds of the mindbody connection . Of the mindbrain connection of quantum physics and all the things surrounding the energetic field of the mind uh , it 's something i 've been fascinated with my entire life uh as a young child"
No," , uh growing up learning about it , but it 's something that i 've been more curious about . But for you to make this your life 's mission and study it and then make it simple : try to simplify the complex in a way so human beings can understand"
No," released in response to things very reflexively like food sex , sleep"
No," joint work with Tim Layton Adriana McIntyre , Adam sakarni . We'Re going to be talking about a field experiment where we aim to reduce administrative barriers with the goal of increasing the takeup of free or lowcost health insurance , so begin by zooming out and thinking"
No," takeup of this free or lowcost health insurance . The idea in our main treatment is that folks will be able to check a box on a sheet of paper . They get in the mail mail back that form and including payment , if necessary , and that 's that 's it that 's how you would enroll , which is"
No," insurance for lowincome individuals , you 're eligible here , it 's a little different than the ACA . More generally , there 's wraparound subsidies . It 'S a program that is separate for people under 300 of the federal poverty level , and you do n't have in order to be"
No," eligible . You do n't have access to Alternative coverage . It 'S nice for our purposes , because this insurance plan that these folks get is largely standardized . There 'S four different insurers that offer it . The prices will vary between insure because"
No," the networks and Drug formularies will vary between insure but kind of cost , sharing , copay design . All that stuff is going to be fixed between these different uh insurers . If you look at the right uh the picture there , you see , the prices of these plans"
No," Okay , so we have free and lowcost insurance , yet take up is still pretty low . It 'S difficult to determine exactly how many people are eligible , but not taking up in Massachusetts as a whole . Previous coauthors uh previous uh authors have"
Environment," standard process . Here need to call to enroll or sign into a website using a login that they themselves may not have created , may have been created by a social worker applying for coverage on their behalf , fill out a bunch of income and other information . Yet again , and that"
No," could be a barrier things we wo n't Target are low valuation , so it could be that they simply do n't value this health care because they have uncompensated care or bankruptcy as Alternatives or that they do n't expect to be here for very long great . You"
Environment," expect that your income will change not going to get uh eligible in a few months , and so you just have again a coverage Gap . As a result , our intervention is going to Target people who are eligible , but not enrolled and specific"
No," people who are the state knows are eligible but are not enrolled and , let 's think about how we could get this group of people . The enrollment process begins with an eligibility determination . You fill out a form , an application . It 'S combined Medicaid connector care"
Environment," this application for me and you know I got this , but it was n't Medicaid . So I never actually chose a plan or people had Medicaid coverage before and I have a redetermination process . Their income has gone up , they 're no longer eligible for Medicaid , but you are"
No," so 70 or it 's not arm 2 . Generic enrollment generic reminder raises enrollment . By about four percent or about one percentage , Point uh relative to Baseline , the personalized reminder is more effective , seven percent or two"
No," median age , and our interventions are more both arm four versus Arm one or the marginal impact of simplification are more effective For older individuals as compared to younger individuals , so it 's not simply that we 're getting low value . People in it suggests that you know"
No," older folks likely have higher value but may face higher administrative burdens or inability to use the web big takeaway from the heterogeneous effects plot . Here is that the optimal intervention , given that these things are costly is unlikely to be constant"
Environment," price change , look for discontinuous enrollment changes and take it away from there and that 's what we see here : number of new enrollees on the yaxis income on the left axis . There 'S . Indeed , these discontinuities in enrollment , at each discontinuity premiums increase by about"
No," some models and you can think of the not actual standard errors , but conceptual standard errors on our welfare estimate is huge model . One simple model you enroll in insurance . If your value is greater than some hassle cost , h , v is"
No," greater than H. What did our treatment ? Do ? It lowered hassle cost by some homogeneous Delta H , everybody had lower hassle costs of enrolling . So when we began with first well , H is going to act like an additional premium , this additional"
No," But that is not the only model you could write down . You could have a heterogeneous effect of our treatment and our treatment . Could you know in a very conservative model , just have affected the hassle costs for the marginal people who enrolled uh ? You"
No," form . You can write down another model where what our treatment does is not actually change some hassle costs , but really enable people to take action while they 're thinking about it . They do n't have to do a bunch of work later . They do"
No," it now , while it 's on their mind , because all they have to do is check a box Builds on some work . I did with memory and procrastination what the treatment does is remind you , and then you enroll , as long as you have positive value for insurance ."
No," Well now , new enrollees are n't people who have just marginal value , but in fact they get their expected value drawn from the whole distribution of people with positive value for insurance . That 'S a really hard thing to measure and we could do some attempts at this ."
No," You could do a linear extrapolation of the demand curve , uh and if you do that , the expected value of a new enrollee is about eleven hundred dollars a year , which means given our impact on enrollment a benefit of about 35 dollars per participant , much"
No," bigger than the Other models - or you could think these subsidies are valued dollar for dollar . Some other work has suggested they 're , not valued for dollar for dollar , but another estimate would be a dollar for dollar value of the subsidies in this program , in which"
No," Massachusetts connector care ? This is post , Affordable Care Act , uh the this Marketplace offers either fully or highly subsidized health insurance , and the population here is people who are known to be eligible but have n't yet enrolled . So these are either people who"
No," , and you know basically we 're Going from somebody having to fill out several forms or undertake a relatively complicated process to somebody filling out , one form in the streamlined process , and they have these additional treatments of a generic reminder and"
No," government . End from much cheaper alternatives of just reminding people or giving people information uh now this was a . This is a really interesting paper for me to discuss because I 'm not in the health , insurance literature . So much , and so I learned a"
No," people with zero premium plans face this one time essentially onetime hassle of signing up , whereas people who have nonzero premium plans face the ongoing Hassle and the ongoing payment right . So this is a really a different treatment for people who are"
No," to the ordeals literature right . There is n't is n't as much work . I think in the ordeals literature in the in the health insurance space uh . There have been a couple of papers by people in this room studying automatic , enrollment uh , but not so much on the administrative"
No," simplification that stopped short of of automatic enrollment . One thing about this paper relative to the ordeals literature is that it 's going to be harder for this paper to make statements about targeting because there 's uh , there 's only sort of limited observable"
No," utilization , for example , in response to getting health insurance , and then we would also want to think about third parties right the who is paying for the health insurance of people who who were n't covered before , and how does that Change now that they have this coverage"
No," in a behavioral framework in a behavioral framework , private welfare could be key to social welfare , in particular , because people who are on the margin between enrolling and not enrolling might really value health insurance right . There might be some"
No," behavioral friction . That 'S preventing them from enrolling , but they actually do value the health insurance , and so we want to take private welfare into account , uh and then , and then social welfare uh same thing uh in terms of externalities ."
No, Okay . So thinking about the simplification tool relative to the other tools that are available uh to help to encourage people to enroll in health insurance right most of the literature has focused uh . This health insurance literature is
No," focused on nudges . So if we think about nudges from a rational framework , nudges are likely to induce people who do n't Value Health Insurance very much right . We in a completely rational framework . We think there 's rational intention . If people really value the"
No," health insurance , they would go and seek out the information and figure out how to enroll in health insurance . Simplification , which is the you know . The real tool that is used in this in this study is also likely to induce people who who are low value , who are on that"
No," margin . Okay , but it helps in for marginal people . Automatic enrollment from the perspective of the rational framework is probably the worst tool in terms of social welfare . It 'S going to induce people who are low value , potentially"
No," even negative value , who really do n't like health insurance . Although again it 'll help those intramarginal people and then subsidies , uh are going to potentially induce people who are low value , but they might be people on a different margin than uh than the people"
No," perspective , so in the behavioral perspective , nudges could induce people who , who are high value so now , inattention is not The same as is not valuing health insurance , uh simplification similarly could induce people who are high value . These are"
No," people who might just magnify the costs of of coverage uh or signing up for health insurance , but really do value it . Automatic enrollment could be the best of of the of these tools in the behavioral framework . For the same reason , and then subsidies subsidies are kind of"
No," interesting . Maybe they fail to induce people who are inattentive but really do value the health insurance . So maybe they induce the wrong people in the behavioral framework . Okay , so I think the key here is that the way we interpret the results really depends on which of"
No," the Frameworks we 're using rational Behavioral . The other thing that I wanted to touch on is thinking about this paper in the context of other work in particular Shepard and Wagner . That 'S been that 's been done , so"
No, and plotting enrollment hassle intensity . On the xaxis and the way that the way that I 'm thinking about this is that the current paper is Shifting us from some low cost to some very low cost and Shepard and Wagner are taking us all the way to zero . Oh no
No, notice right is that these are first very different scales for the zero premium ineligibles . We see that simplification is actually less effective if anything than reminders or information uh this . This sort of demonstrates the value of this
No," , no upfront cost And no ongoing monetary or or hassle costs , and the key question here right from before is : do they actually value the health insurance . So this you know especially relevant question , given that they did n't sign up before , despite having zero cost of"
No," signing up under a rational framework . As we talked about uh , they might not value the health insurance right and then the question is : why are they about to get employersponsored health insurance ? Are they just not that riskaverse from a"
No," behavioral perspective , they might be still high value , uh consumers , it 's kind of hard to answer this question without more observable characteristics . There 'S also an interesting question of why some Fade Out . Is it that they 're moving"
No," away ? Is that they 're about to get employersponsored health insurance , and are they not not signing up because they 're , anticipating , for example , that they will be getting employersponsored health insurance soon and really last comment uh ? So one thing I was thinking"
No," related to that . I was thinking of which modesty also mentioned the sort of striking like Fade Out effect . It occurred to me and Adam would know more about this than I from from our work together , but like we 're interpreting this as turning off it could be that"
No," very interesting . Uh just a question about who um these people , who are before possibly an insured or in a suboptimal insurance ? Is there any information about what uh , what sources they were using for healthcare ? Were they going to a public clinic or were they going to the"
No, emergency room ? For the regular care and the reason why I think that 's important is because emergency room is so costly relative to just giving them insurance and being able to use that and people who are uninsured and to just go to the emergency room even when they just need
No," Some type of like something for a flu or for a fever , so I just think it would be interesting to discuss what was their counter factual before . I think it would be fabulous to know uh what would happen like . Hopefully , one"
No," paper , is to quantify the mechanisms underlying this male female ADHD . Diagnostic difference . More generally , my hope is that it could also provide a framework for future research to address the dispersion in mental health outcomes in the United"
No," meet the criteria for ADHD , but that does not explain the full difference in diagnosis rates . The majority or the rest of it is mainly driven by differences in diagnostic thresholds . So a physician who sees a male and a female with the exact same"
No," a diagnosis for females . This contributes to literature , related literature , um , I 'm not going to go into detail , but basically there 's a lot on ADHD and children . There 'S this relative to age , literature and the effects on human"
No," disruptive , symptoms and females are more likely to also have internalizing coexisting conditions like depression and anxiety . Okay . So what I 'm going to look at is pediatric electronic health records from a large Healthcare System in Arizona"
No," That said , what I 'm going to be estimating and looking at is the relative difference between males and females and given in my sample , they 're observably , similar in other characteristics . Um , that 's not ! The sample is not going to"
No," bias that relative difference . Another thing I want to highlight is : there 's 303 primary care , physicians and 151 diagnosing Physicians . These are in this system . You do n't need to be a psychiatrist or a psychologist . These can just be pediatricians , but at least in"
No," identifying variation importantly , I also have access to deidentified doctors notes which summarizes what 's happening in these behavioral assessments , and I 'm going to use these to construct these missing mental health variables , and I say"
No, health care um and the idea being like . Could it just be that male children are just more likely to go to the doctor to receive an assessment and claims data ? That 'S the one benefit is : maybe you would be able to observe
No," that in electronic health records no instead , what I 'm going to use is a machine learning approach . So I assume that I do observe whether or not the patient receives a behavioral assessment . If they have a diagnosis for a behavioral health condition , ADHD or any"
No, or it 's a code like stomach pain which could be associated with a virus or anxiety and stress . So I 'm going to predict that label using a machine learning approach where I 'm going to figure out which words are most predictive of behavioral assessment or
No," are vaccine blood and fever . So once I do that estimation , I do find that males are more likely to receive a behavioral assessment than females . About 20 of males will be assessed for a behavioral health condition and only 15 percent of females ."
No," condition . 34 percent of males will be diagnosed with ADHD and only 18 of humans , so the next question is well : how much is it just that males are presenting with ADHD specific symptoms and females are presenting with maybe anxiety or"
No," depression again , ideally , in the electronic health record , There would be a variable that says : patient needs , symptom , one two three and four : that 's not the case . So instead is I 'm going to look at the behavioral assessment note and I 'm going"
No," behavioral words for those that do n't . There is some evidence that males have a slightly higher match value than females . Do , but there 's not a big difference , and that can be seen here as well . By just looking at a difference in means um they 're only different at about the 10"
No," Disk Utility for making a diagnostic error . So quick outline patients , I assume , have some underlying ADHD risk . Patients are , rather their parents and caregivers are going to choose to schedule a behavioral assessment and they 'll do so . If their"
No," symptoms are high or their costs of selecting into care is low , then Physicians will learn about the patient 's risk and they will update their beliefs . So this is going to be a function of the signal , quality or their uncertainty"
No, select into Behavior into behavioral assessment . I assume there 's some costs of scheduling assessment . There could be a genderspecific mental health utilization costs . Maybe it 's just costlier to take boys to the doctor to receive an assessment . I do n't know
No," , so conditional on receiving a behavioral assessment so conditional on Qi equals one positions are going to conduct a behavioral assessment and learn about the patient 's symptoms . I assume they have a normal prior belief about the behavioral"
No," beliefs , and so their posterior belief is ADHD risk . Given the signal that I observed is going to have this normal distribution - and what 's key here is the mean - is going to be a weighted sum of their prior belief and the signal they receive from the patient , and they can"
No," risk is above some threshold Tau , so we can think of Tau as measuring the relative cost of making a diagnostic error . So if tau is high , it 's cost . You only want to diagnose those with very high risk , because you think it 's costlier to"
No, So there 's the probability that a child receives a behavioral assessment and then conditional on that the probability that they 're diagnosed with ADHD . So what I 've bolded here is the observed or the constructed data . So there 's patient gender and clinical diagnosis
No," assessment rates would help me identify utilization costs C. This next equation is essentially a probate where the coefficient or the risk yeah the risk signal coefficient would help identify the signal , strength"
No, PCP needs to be correlated with the patient 's decision to schedule a behavioral assessment . You can think about differences in annual Wellness visit quality . Perhaps some are thorough and asking : how is your child doing at school ? How are their behaviors ? Maybe
No," are using a much higher threshold for females than for males , and you can think about this as relative to a misdiagnosis . A missed diagnosis is costlier for male patients , so , in order to be diagnosed , they have to have females have to have at least 05 risks"
No," the observed difference of 249 to 1 . So if I do the model simulation and I hold and make sure that males and females have the exact same parameter values , there 's no difference so they 're diagnosed one to one . If I allow the underlying ADHD risk"
No," distribution parameters to be at their estimated values , the disparity or the difference increases to 15 to 1 , which is to say that um you can see . This is about a third of the difference so about a third of the difference . In diagnosis rates is"
No," there 's a high cost of not diagnosing them and not treating them , in which case a lower threshold is warranted . At the same time , females are more likely to have these internalizing comorbidities , anxiety and depression . There 'S some evidence that stimulant use"
No," which is um the treatment for ADHD . Those are associated with higher rates of depression in girls , which is costly right . So that 's a high cost of an overdiagnosis and over treatment , in"
No," which case we should be using higher thresholds um . It could be that they 're already receiving behavioral therapy for anxiety and depression , which might help with ADHD symptoms again Lower costs of not diagnosing them lower thresholds ."
No," Um , but this is also consistent with a crowd out story where they 're under diagnosing females , because they 're too worried about these other symptoms which could lead to longer run costs and I 'm at zero minutes . So I 'm going to wrap up and conclude you had . That was the one"
No," prevalence differences , the Rest by differences in position diagnostic thresholds , but I do discuss why the deviation could be optimal um , but I do think future research is needed in that area to think about what we should do . Next , with this finding"
No," , I will be the first to admit : there 's a ton of limitations about this paper um I go . I'Ve been going through and thinking about some of these things in their you know in appendix H , um , but more generally , I do think that the I 'm you know I 'm proud of the paper"
No," and I do think the general model and estimation framework could be used . It 'S pretty broad , so it could be used to understand mental health differences and disparities . More broadly , you know not just between male and female , not just in Arizona and not just for ADHD . So thank"
No," the important constructs , including whether the child was actually assessed for 80 ADHD or not observed in the data , and I think it 's important to keep in mind that almost all of the diagnosing here is is not being done by Psychiatrists so like when you read the"
No," paper and you keep hearing about referrals for Behavioral assessments , what you think of is the family doctor referring say to a psychiatrist or psychologist or an evaluation , but that is not what 's happening . It seems to be family doctors"
No," referring to other family doctors , um and so in order to determine whether a behavioral assessment is actually happening or not . Kelly uses uh text analysis of the emrs and to do that , as she said she uses"
No, visits that end up with ADHD diagnoses and so using this method . She estimates that about 18 of the children are receiving a behavioral assessment and that 's this key quantity qi . So one thing I thought reading through the paper is that more institutional details about
No," how assessments actually work in this particular Health Care System would be really helpful . Um . So you know it 's important to know if there 's assessments actually going on , because there 's kind of an assumption that if the children are not being"
No," assessed , then they ca n't be diagnosed and selection into assessment could be important . But you know what , if there is n't formal assessment going on what if people are just having a discussion with their PCP and they talk about how their child could be hyperactive and that PCP"
No," But in this case , ADHD might not appear as the primary indication for the visit and also clearly , some children are receiving ADHD medications without necessarily getting a formal ADHD diagnosis . So I thought it would be interesting , maybe to train the"
No," model using all of the Physicians diagnosing ADHD or prescribing ADHD , as well as all children who had any diagnosis on the record . So if ADHD is mentioned somewhere , but is n't the primary reason for the visit , maybe those people should also be included ."
No, would refer a child to another PCP for a behavioral health evaluation . Um - and you know - maybe that 's a peculiarity of this particular Health System . One thing I wondered about was that maybe some of the primary care providers are not actually Physicians so
No," that they ca n't prescribe , and they have to refer to a physician just more details about that would be useful . Also , this PCP referral rate actually seemed to be defined as a leave , one out measure of the propensity of a particular pcp 's child children to get an assessment ."
No," that 's making it a huge difference . So it might be interesting to look at the way that behavioral symptoms are discussed for the children who do n't seem to be getting a diagnosis as well uh , so uh again , as Kelly said , the uh"
No," : girls are more likely to have type 1 . Boys are more likely to have type 2 type . 2 is a lot more disruptive , so Anna azer , for example , has a paper about the effects of having a child with ADHD on the other children in the classroom , so higher externalities could justify"
No," at other groups . Um . One group that might be particularly interesting in this context is to look at the Hispanic children uh . Do doctors have different thresholds for them uh , or is it sort of more on the demand side which I guess would show up in the"
No," utilization parameter here ? Another thing I wondered given that it 's Arizona is whether there 's a sample of indigenous children that could be identified . So I think , there 's a lot that could be done , potentially even within this sample and then just a few caveats . The way the"
No," , um in papers about child mental health , there 's usually some sort of statement . That says you know . Well , it 's really important that the children should be diagnosed so that they can get treatment and that will help them . But I think it 's important to recognize"
No," that a lot of times it does n't seem like treatment is helping people very much so uh in the case of ADHD treatment . It may not be improving educational outcomes , although it does seem to reduce risky behaviors injuries and so on . So one of the largest rcts on ADHD treatment"
No," basically found that the uh ADHD kids fared worse than at the comparison group on most of the variables tested , whether or not they were treated and concluded that they really needed some new treatment approaches , and I think that 's Important to bear in mind"
No," and it 's possible actually that the main benefit of ADHD treatment may be in terms of minimizing externalities on on other people , which would be interesting to think about in terms of these threshold models . So those were all my comments again . I"
No," interested in this diagnosing decision um because I did n't think it had been fully understood and studied , whereas treatment had um so for the main focus . It was just on the diagnosing decision , but I agree and I do have treatment data - it 's just not"
No," cleaned um , but that is on the todo list to do and given that you 're trying to solve this election problem earlier in earlier since it seems like you could Also get better identification on thinking about those treatment differentials than other"
No," about it , but I do n't think he made for a little bit different reason s not so much , even if you 're not measuring the returns to treatment like . I think the reason that we care about diagnosis is it might open up an opportunity for treatment . So looking at"
No," treatment rates and like the modality , like I 'm thinking , there 's like drugstore 's behavioral therapy and then there might be harder to see in your data but like academic , accommodations , um and trying to understand like whether . How do I , whether diagnosis is kind of"
No," needed to trigger that pathway and whether the treatment rates are different by gender , like it can help sort of build the stakes of like why we should care about the diagnosis ? No , I think that I think that 's right and"
No," unfortunately , or do you make any links to which school they go to or anything like that um ? To what extent do you think , like doctors , have different beliefs about the the role of teachers in referring uh ? You know males versus girls and the other"
No, thing to understand . Your results may be explained by racial differences . So what sorry ? Let me repeat the question : what do do Physicians ? Do you think doctors have different beliefs when they see you know our boys refer from the teacher uh . You know to behavioral
No," assessment versus a gift , so they could um and this kind of gets a little bit back to Janet 's question about if they have a bias prior belief , um . And I think this is a little bit of detailed hidden in the appendix a little"
No," bit , but you can , inter , if they do have biased beliefs and Tau , should not be interpreted as differences in this utility from error . It 'S uh some function of bias , priors and costs of digest error , and I ca n't disentangle them , but it is definitely possible that perhaps the"
No, reason why they 're using lower thresholds for boys could be because they have different beliefs about maybe referrals from teachers . All right . I have Lee more Monica and then I also had one question : if I missed anyone put your hand back up anymore
No," Are they being diagnosed with something else I figured this was way before appendix H , like anxiety and therefore potentially equally likely to be referred for additional care . Then there 's the question of whether it 's good and are they on medications , but I"
No," wanted to ask what what they were getting as a diagnosis ? Yes , yes , they 're much more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety and depression . I think if they do have ADHD , they should also be diagnosed with ADHD . It 'S not like you can only have one or the other"
No," um , but that 's kind of the last bullet point . There is yes , they are now more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety , depression , um , and so they could be benefiting from treatment from those things , but I do think there might be if they do have"
No," ADHD and they 're not being diagnosed with that , because it 's something else There could be longer run costs um , so I 'll write a paper on that in like 10 years and is the rate of diagnosis for a mental health condition conditional on a referral the same for"
No," anxiety for the pressure , so presumably taking medication for those and the interaction between several medications . When your requests are starting to use a very nature and then file and error leads to um"
No," so but um . That was my comment , but like the way that I think uh to be addressed for a decision , the signal making and evidence of learning process for a young career position . They are still um missing diagnosis , uh"
No," diagnosing and treating them , because they 're already being treated for uh depression , and so there could be some bad interactions there um and I really like the idea of I ca n't Look at gender gender match , but I can kind of look at differences by"
No," insurance schemes in place , public ones in the country . We'Re going to be studying that mute , the incentives of customers to be price , sensitive uh , even in the US there seems to be a discussion of going in this direction . Europe already is : is there"
No," and so uh in the remaining time , I 'm gon na walk you through the reforms . We have give you a glimpse of the data and then throw a lot of even study grass at you and then a table where I hope to spend most of my time . That 'S the summary results and then I 'm pretty sure I 'm"
No," prescription , you can change the drug to a cheaper one . You may or may not have Financial incentives . Financial incentives are introduced . If there 's also reference pricing in place now , reference pricing can be implemented"
No," be able in the pharmacy to change your drugs , The Physician had to allow that in the prescription . Okay , so that 's the laxis regime we have now reference . Pricing can be done in two major ways : either you refer to prices externally , so in other countries"
No," , hence no incentives for the firms to engage in much price competition . Generic substitution means that everybody who arrives at the pharmacy can change the drugs , but does n't have any incentives to do so . Then you can attach either internal or"
No," details later on , and so those those are at the stricter end of of the regimes and so six reforms uh . We have six treatment countries at different points in time . We always need to find a control country uh and in this table , to"
No," and then we do also a package level analysis to be in line with the existing literature on prices uh . The way we construct our estimation , samples is that we take a treatment country , say Finland . In O3 , we look at what age is five markets ? Are"
Environment, reforms and then we redo this exercise six times . Something you ought to keep in mind is that we only look at the pharmacy market there 's also the hospital market for drugs . We leave that out because price setting there is very different from the
No," there are Previous reforms , both in the control and the treatment country and future reforms - and so we do n't want those to uh bias , the results we uh look at okay . The way we target the reforms is we 've gone through the legislation . I told you"
No," about the RAS , and so we know exactly when there were public announcements . We know when the parliament 's uh ratified uh the reforms uh , and so so that 's how we uh time the beginning of the treatment period . Okay , so a road map to to the results ."
No," First , we look at Finland going from uh voluntary generic substitution , so the physician had to allow you to change your drug to generic substitution , where you could do it , but no incentives to then Finland actually giving customers Financial incentives uh to"
No," anything there , there are more products available rather than fewer . Okay , that was lots of even study graphs uh . Maybe it 's helpful to show you a table with uh average treatment effects , and so now I have thank you now . I have the different"
No," average prices - and you can see how the differences are quite Stark Point - estimates are way smaller in absolute value , they 're , actually not statistically significant , that uh regular levels . What explains this ? Let me use the Swedish as an example ."
No," So , roughly speaking , our results say that in Sweden , prices did n't change , expenditure went down by 30 percent , what 's going on well , customers were given steep incentives to buy the cheapest drug and nothing else"
No," it 's uh , probably a good idea to start off this discussion by talking about what this paper is and and is n't about . So this is certainly paper about reference pricing and uh trying to reduce and regulation to reduce drug prices . But it 's important to note that"
No," the kinds of markets that are being studied here are ones with . Mostly the vast majority uh have off patent drugs uh with available generics . I know the kinds of markets where Regulators feel comfortable , basically uh , sometimes you 're mandating substitution to"
No," particular products , that is to say , there are many different versions of the same drug with the same . Active ingredients and Regulators are willing to sort of sign off and say . This is basically the same thing , and so it does n't matter which one you purchase so this . So when"
No," we look at the uh the impacts here , they 're not really going to tell us very much about access to new treatments . Maybe they 'll tell us something about availability of different uh product types of package types , but not new drugs , uh and we 're probably not so worried"
No," essentially in these markets , there 's not all that much pricing pressure to begin with consumers have uh most of their drug purchasing reimbursed to a very , very large degree , and until these policies uh started to come into place , it seemed like There"
No," packages or products For the same drug , more Salient to Consumers and I 'm kind of loosely categorizing , these different policies here , but you can think of them as being bucketed , either in uh into an indirect pricing pressure policy , so basically a form of giving the consumer"
No," either just access the ability To choose different variants of the drug and ideally , maybe pay the difference between the um , the lowest possible drug type available uh and the one and the brand that they want and more uh , extreme or direct pricing"
No," affecting the prices one way or another okay . So with that said , uh , because the drugs here are really uh very genericized and we can think about having many different types of substitutable options . It 'S very important that the paper makes a big a"
No," big deal out of the idea that , when we think about expenditure or quantity purchase for drugs , we 're not thinking about purchases on the package level , because in some sense we know that all of these are are substitutable . We do n't really care which version consumers are"
No," buying . Instead , what we care about is the total expenditure for the drug as a whole forever , all of across all of the different options of the generics for the same for the same drug um , and so to do that . The paper focuses on Total Drug level expenditure , that 's"
No," at the Active molecule , uh average drug level prices so again across all possible packages . What was the average price and when they think about availability , they think about basically the number of different packages that you that you can buy"
No," um as a as a proxy for for how competitive things things remain ? Okay , so uh , I 'm very glad I put this graph in the this . This figure in my discussion because it did n't show up in the in the presentation , but this is basically the"
No," that changed uh , the type of of regulatory policy in each of these countries , and the reason That this graph is so important is that this is basically the the basis that the that the authors use to establish their treatment and control design ."
No," , so Market here you should think of - is basically just a type of Drug uh that the different packages of which are are sensibly substitutable and , as I said before , we 're going to treat we 're going to focus on the total consumption and expenditure at the drug"
No," level . So we do n't care , for example , if the consumption for any particular packages increasing or decreasing we . What we want ideally , is that the total consumption for the drug is more or less staying . The same people are n't , you know not taking drugs , because they 're too"
No," expensive uh , but hopefully expenditure on average is , is decreasing now because we 're thinking of every ATC 5 as a unit . I wonder if we 're implicitly assuming that there 's no a substitution across these drugs and the reason I asked that is that in in my work at"
No," least um we 've uh We 've looked at drug markets a little bit more broadly at the atc4 level . So at the treatments level , um and there 's good reason to think that , at least in some drug markets , uh people can substitute not just at the"
No, design and so um . I wonder that that might be a good thing to clarify : okay and then uh a few more details . So the treatment timing here and the event study is going to refer to the announcement of the reform law . Uh each
No," some of these policies might have taken longer for some drugs than others um . And if that 's the case , that might actually pose a an issue for um . For the event study design , it might might generate some contamination across units"
No," um , and so that that would be also very helpful to clarify okay , but that said uh . This is a fairly standard , uh event study designed once you accept the treatment of control , and so the key assumption here always is that you have"
No," something that looks like parallelograms between treatment and controls , basically that , when the the treatment country , the country that is undergoing a Change in regime uh is switching the exact same drug in another country that is under a stable"
No," regime . Uh is a good proxy for for the Dynamics of our time . Okay . So so now let me uh . Let me zoom in on the different diff a little bit and think about the assumptions , because this is really what I uh spent the most time . Thinking about , as I was reading the"
No," paper . So the big question for me is whether it really makes sense to think about treatment and control in this context , if we think about the canonical um causal inference framework or the experimental design framework , what we would like to think is that for every"
No," unit , let 's say Every drug class um X Andy , it was uh random , whether it entered a regime that was changing or not in a context where there 's already some fixed regime in a different different way ."
No," drug level uh units , that is ATC 5 level units instead of product level units , is fixing the super problem because you 're not uh , you 're , abstracting , away from equilibrium . Pricing effects among packages that that are competing and and the Dynamics of which are surely"
No," changing due to the regulation , so I completely agree with that argument . I think that makes a lot of sense and it makes a lot of sense to think about drugs at the ATC 5 level um . But I wonder if that 's enough uh first there 's a question I 've raised"
No," heterogeneity across drugs . This is a classic uh issue of contamination in in these kinds of treatment effect um in these kind of different diff Frameworks uh , and it was n't really clear to me how to think about comparing you know a big set of different drug classes"
No," yeah ? Absolutely let me uh . Let me just spend uh 30 seconds and I 'll finish , so the drug policies seem to be quite effective at reducing expenditures and what it seems to be happening is that they 're , reducing expenditures by shifting round substitution to cheaper"
No," um . The demand and Supply shocks uh absolutely a potential where , if we actually do check across countries uh , what is the overlap between our treatment and control countries in the terms of the packages available in both"
No," and I 'm not sure uh what 's Happening Here is it demand or Supply , and so I came prepared to say thinking about demand if I believed in welfare economics - and you told me that a policy that reduced Price had no effect on quantity or almost no effect , which I"
Environment," think is what you found right . I 'D say well that does n't improve efficiency , that just redistributes income toward taxpayers and consumers and away from widows and orphans that own Drug Company stock , and I"
No," so at least there 's it . It gets maybe one star rather than two stars , but then the uh this morning before uh before the meeting started , I had CNN on and they were talking about , there 's a shortage of Adderall , the generic drug for ADHD and they had a teenager on there . Who said"
No," when she started taking Adderall , she got all A 's on her tests and now that she ca n't get the drug she 's , afraid she 'll go back to being a c student and but then one of the commentators said well , the reason there 's a shortage is that this Is generic and they make drug"
No," great paper uh , two quick questions . The impact of some of the policies that you talk about , I 'm thinking about IRP , especially um , depends on the number of competitors in the market or can interact with the number of competitors . So I was wondering"
No," negative effects of creating a monopoly and related to that ? How should we think about quality , especially in the longer run when firms are so incentivized to Just Produce the lowest priced product ? Do they now , then procure lower quality ingredients for the same drug so"
No," , serious servants uh to to monitor the quality of the drugs uh and uh , and that 's about what we can do . Ashton um . So I think a little bit to shosha 's point about how a lot of the control"
No," groups are basically uh posttreatment for a different type of treatment . You know in the middle of their fling with Erp for five years . It seems like you could address some of that . Maybe , by using trying a different set of controls that are in much more stable regimes and"
No," brief answer is no . We do n't do it uh slightly longer answer , definitely worth looking into so anecdotally . We know that lowincome people might not buy uh the drugs that they 've been prescribed uh before they hit the uh the ceiling where it 's zero out of pocket , and so there are"
Environment," Ventures are started for HCA compared to other large Hospital Systems , Hospital chains , ASU change and other other institutional investors , and then we 're going to play around with the same robustness exercise we did before"
Environment," average Trend . Again it seems to be different , and so the event study looks kind of like what you would expect given the raw data uh , when we do this uh this little robustness exercise . Now there are some entities that actually end up with a"
No," uh . We also look specifically at pregnancy , related care and so focusing on those emissions specifically to look at paramix treatment , intensity , patient sources , patient travel , distance , essentially all the things to try and understand , if even if , they 're , not"
No, quite a bit over a half a day or 12 percent uh relative to Baseline uh . The likelihood of having a surgery involved in the inpatient stay is going to go down . The likelihood of any procedure at all during the impatience day is also going to go down .
No," magnitude of the change and nowhere near as sharp or as extensive as what we Saw in the drop of length of stay and more treatment intensive care , the other thing that 's important to note is even when we look within a pair group . All of these reductions in care intensity show up"
Environment," paired groups , so they were not known for doing this at Baseline , but things might change very quickly uh . In order to do this exercise , we actually have to bring in one more uh Florida discharge database , which is going to give us the universe of emergency department visits"
No," strongly and persistent , persistently changing is the likelihood that they are going to admit those patients over to the inpatient side , um and in in terms of relative magnitudes . You know we see a 36 percent increase at Peak on the commercial side"
No," Inpatient throughput so getting more people in , but also getting them out , faster and and particularly focused on nonpregnancy related admissions stays are shorter and less treatment intensive , and these Behavior changes extend beyond the private Equity ownership phase , so it"
No, hospital Contracting uh with with physician staffing companies . The relative changes are often of a similar magnitude and at times uh even larger . You could imagine where these have Financial benefits for hospitals in terms of increasing Revenue uh by
No," those dips from tenant and Community Health Systems seem to be specific about those Hospital Systems , as opposed to something that would Have been true for the market , okay and the last thing is in terms of empirical steps , at least for"
No," completeness uh we 're on the Ed side when we look at Staffing , as well as the treatment intensity , especially for those visits that do n't convert to the inpatient side . We think we 're going to be able to look at physician practice , Acquisitions or expansions of providers"
No," the hospital industry and the other parties involves the acquiring parties . Are , you know , Bain Capital of Mitt Romney , Fame , uh , KKR Barbarians at the gate . These are n't your typical private Equity firms , so I do n't think we should fool ourselves into thinking that this is"
No," 838 hospitals , and here we 're going to have one cluster . One acquisition check with your local econom attrition , but I 'm pretty sure that if treatment here is assigned at the chain level , you should probably be treating this as a uh . You know one chain , one cluster"
No," Equity is just a pool of of money right . What are they doing ? That gets us to these impacts on profits and patient outcomes and the kind of typical framework that at least I use when thinking about it is you know , private Equity borrows a bunch of money . Levers"
No," run the play and that 's actually probably pretty important . If we 're thinking about a lot of these proposals around - oh , maybe we should ban private Equity from owning Health Care Providers . Well , you might actually ask yourself . Maybe"
No," pretty clearly a home run . Bane got rich every all their investors got rich . I think , probably what you 're mostly interested in is thinking about the impact here on other stakeholders , patience and this , I think , is actually the hardest"
No," was n't really necessary , but even there . I think we should be a little bit , hesitant uh for a few reasons . First , because actually HCA was way below the average . In terms of the admissions from the Ed in the preperiod and really the treatment is just moves them up to where"
No," everyone else is , and second is , I think you know we 're not doctors I 'm a little uncomfortable . Actually , maybe you are uh the rest of us . I think are uncomfortable , saying : hey , we know which of these patients based on the claims should have uh should have gone to the hospital"
Environment," have two questions for you , comments , questions um . The first has to do with the motivation for the advertising . I think there 's a special HCA reason for the increase in advertising , which is the 10 years before that their name was dirt um . They were busy still scraping"
No," system goes from the largest in the country from the 360 hospitals you 're looking at to now , which is literally half of that . So I wonder about the effect of you know : are we seeing the fact that your controls and your um and your treatment Hospital those are just"
No," it mean that they 're closing hospitals in other markets ? What are the internal Capital markets , a capital Market of HCA ? What does that look like if you can get your hands on it , because it might be that Florida is being pumped up a little to get treatment for of these patients ?"
No," Zoom Will just go crazy um . We do n't see this big drop off , we 're kind of we 're , seeing much more of that tail end of that kind of historical decline so going from like 180 to about 160 and kind of smoothly over time . So I do n't so we would be at the tail end of"
Environment," on . So we at least at a minimum , do a detailed uh , accounting exercise of the controls and then and then see . If there actually is sufficient variation , can we do this kind of comparison ? Do you see similar behaviors , terrific , there 's so much interest where , as the organizers"
No," the seventh , eighth and Ninth , but the first five papers , uh and so uh . I 'D be curious to hear to what extent your treatment and your control groups are isolated from each other during the time that uh that you look at uh , so could there be contamination from"
Environment," the treatment to the controls ? Thank you , yeah uh . So so that 's good . I forgot to put that up there . One of the additional empirical exercises we want to do is to do a sensitivity check where we make a further refinement on the control group hospitals , where we kick out those that"
No," are in HCA markets , because , while there 's a density of them in the State of Florida , They are not spread out across all the Florida and they have kind of geographic concentrations , and so we can do aversion to see , especially for the headline results . Do we see the same"
No," know , say : oh look , these are the kinds of changes we want , so it 'd be interesting to think about through that lens kind of why why were n't they able to do this beforehand , but also thinking about Maybe within say the productivity distribution"
No," with that increase in complexity um , but that still does n't does n't nail down . If , in fact , transaction prices are changing , I 'm trying to think through . If maybe we could use other data to say something about the surrounding Insurance Market structure and then it"
No," building on what Maria was saying was saying . I was thinking about how do you think about the relationship of this experiment relative to another sort of privatization , experiment which is from like governmentowned hospitals to private hospitals , which probably the"
No," starting point is different . But the the channels that should be at play should be pretty similar and , like I 'm thinking about the recent Mark , Dagan paper and it seemed to be finding like quite negative impacts on Medicaid , uh patients and access . And so how . How ? If you have ways"
No," of thinking about uh these two different experiments and why you find pretty different results , thanks yeah uh , so one way to think about it is maybe so as as has been pointed out . This is one very large important deal , but it is one deal uh and one way to think about . It is"
No," this kind of financial engineering , behavior and so on . So I I think when , when trying to go big picture thinking about policy and regulation , it is probably at least a cause for pause about . In terms of how blunt of instruments can we use in terms of"
No," can we use that to get some of the variations ? Does that explain some of the the lingering effects after KKR exits ? So I 'm glad you brought this up because I needed your institutional details , so everything I could find was pointing to or toward HCA and entry and"
No," through 2011 12 13 on kind of that stable right , um . And so , while you know thinking about about your work around us um , you know it for HCA . Specifically , I was wondering if in fact , ncare is really changing , at least on that particular"
No," margin um . But but once we look at ed treatment , intensity , Behavior it 'll be interesting to see if it 's a similar kind of early dynamic or if it does show up in the later use when the mcare joint venture relationship , the emergency room result"
No," So , for example , if a rest , if a restaurant on Yelp gets a higher rating , it can simply raise the price of its entree to reflect the fact that people know of the higher quality in large sense . A doctor with a five star rating ca n't charge a higher copay than"
No," practitioner . I use these two data sets to come to create a provider month panel . I focus first on family medicine for a number of reasons . First , it 's the largest population of providers in the data . It 'S also one where patients often make an"
No," active choice of their provider . So if you 're an HMO and you have to choose a family medicine provider , it may be the case that you 're looking online , in particular for this information relative to um to other Specialties . There 'S also just a lot of these providers . Choice"
No," sets are very large for Family Medicine . I reconstruct what the website was displaying in a given month , and I focus on two periods . The 2017 to late 2018 period is when ratings were collected by the health system , but never disclosed . They lived on the Excel files of one"
No," than the United States as a whole , but otherwise pretty representative of what you would expect . There are 12 million visits over the course of my data set over a million unique individual patients at the provider month level , a family"
No," was reasonably informative . Once the disclosure took place , but half of the Family Medicine Physicians are Physicians , almost all of them are NDS . The other 45 percent are nurse practitioners , also providing family"
No," medicine and Primary Care , um 340 distinct Family Medicine docs in the system . So here I have a crosssectional OLS regression , where the lefthand side is the number of brand new patients per month of physician sees and the right"
No," with different slopes on each side . That corresponds exactly to the figure I showed you a moment or two ago , which is a three new patient bump on a baseline of five and a half patients for having a higher star rating online relative to a lower star rating ."
No," you in the figure two slides ago . This is after the quality ratings are online . There are more new patients per month . Seen if you have a high rating relative to a low rating , the red triangles are the quality scores for each provider that were never actually disclosed right ."
No," and mechanisms to really unpack . What 'S going on in this demand response , so here I separate out Family Medicine versus the other large major Specialties in this Healthcare System , Specialties , as defined by this system in Family Medicine . I find a large effect and the"
No," , whereas Family Medicine , we 're choices , are relatively large and insurance design forces patients , often to make an Active Choice over their family medicine and primary care doctor , that 's where I 'm picking up the largest effect of quality information online ."
No, evaluate their family medicine doctors and find a correlation between the batting average of doctors performing these tests when they are supposed to so colorectal cancer . Screenings on patients indicated for colorectal cancer screenings and the rating of the
No," , um and also I residualized the regressions . I would visualize the observations based on the diagnosis of a patient . You do n't wait very long for a fever . You wait a long time for a checkup um , just to control for the different kinds of conditions that patients come"
No," prices once they get sick , because we have value from risk . Protection , right and Ben is uh at least implicitly putting those two things together and so showing how in fact wait times are kind of an alternative mechanism for rationing care and it might interact and"
No, about both in the changing and how the paper works and also kind of in our thinking here . So there 's two sides of the market . It 'S going to clear we 're going to think about demand for discounted future access and time T to a doctor with value V that I can figure
Environment," income effects where they say . Oh well , you know . If I get full , I can golf twice a week that might be a strong incentive or it might be . I want to select patients . I think it 's worth thinking more about how that actually interacts um"
No," some severe pain , but then the flip of that you 're focused on Family Medicine um . If a lot of this is about access to Future Health and eventualities , would n't I have a very long wait time because I just want to you know get it get in with the right doctor , because I do n't have"
No," anything here . So it 's not clear kind of why ? For example , three days like , why would you ever land there um , and so how are people thinking about discounting in the model term , okay , um ? So the second thing I want to flag here"
No," , a little bit is thinking about the Rd strategy that you employ , and some of this is gon na . You know . One thing this paper does really nicely is : has this kind of clean identification to focus on what are these effects and then has , in the background this model of kind of how"
No," um . So let me spend the last little bit sort of thinking about quality information practice , because one thing this this paper does wonderfully well is uh really get us a good look at these increasingly common consumer reported star ratings"
No," the barn on these things . This is the way doctors are going to get scored . So we need to understand how that 's going to work , and that 's actually a really nice contribution of this paper relative to say , older stuff , which is on nice technical things like riskadjusted"
No," are traditional stock doctors ? You know old white men might be like well . I was satisfied , regardless of the clinical quality . That 'S going to actually have distortionary effects and there is some kind of evidence more from the medical literature ."
Environment, this stuff ? I had this conversation with the former Chief Executive Officer of the University of Pennsylvania health system and he said we want to control the information environment . We do n't want people going out there and getting information from somewhere else right . So
Environment," letting someone else on the market control the narrative control . The information environment , but to your question , is there even another information environment , not so much so in this particular setting , which is not true about out the rest of the country ?"
Environment," Another way longer so even within that group , I think there 's some heterogeneity among those who truly lose or not so , for example , those who have a high income might just actually go to an outofnetwork doctor where you just pay out of pocket , and then your insurance"
Environment," takes It , but if your income constraint , paying out of pocket uh , might be a problem . Another issue with like waiting , I think , is uh flexibility like if your work schedule is flexible , you 're , probably not so affected by the actual wait time , because a doctor might be"
No," days it 's those groups who can not easily um speak about their health issues . Like an infant or other geriatric population like if I think I might have a pain , deciders , I know better to know , wait three days , I just go to the to the ER , but an infant or a geriatric patient ."
Environment," , um to the to the losers , who people who might otherwise go out of network um . I ca n't observe whether someone went out of the system and out of network . It 'S just a limitation to my data and my environment . The nice thing about the system is , if a doctor , if one Doctor Is"
No," , then um , I 'm sorry , I do n't know , but back there and then Jan and Mariko wow , so Maggie all right . I bet um really great talk , um . I am curious . What the distribution of wait times looks like because um the way that I 'm thinking about it , I"
No," Thank you , um we 're starting to run a little short on time . So please keep your questions . Concise , David , please yeah one . I know this is an integrated system , but in some systems , even though your insurance would allow you to set up an appointment with the doctor , they may"
No," visits ? Are the ones being delayed versus ones that are not ? I think that 's kind of essential , like are the Urgent ones , still getting taken care of properly and are they delaying on the less urgent ones , so this system is less integrated than the system that I think you 're . Thinking"
No," there too . Obviously , that 's the kind of thing where the cost of that is astronomical relative to the to the to the kind of setting , but there 's other ways to cut it . That I that I could do more of thanks ."
No," over time . Maybe you can separate and kind of learn about kind of Market , moving from no information to to revealed information separately from the kind of adjustments sort of on in the under equilibrium . Already one thing that I hope to do and somewhat in the spirit"
No," Thanks and Marika gets the last question um all right . I wanted to ask about whether you can look at if there 's a uh . I was thinking sort of one thing here is that if you 're really great physician , it may be that other Physicians or midlevel providers in your in your"
No," hospitals and nursing homes and prescription drug plans , Physicians , the administration , administrators of the hospital and even medical devices , and all of these are examples of scores designed by either an intermediary or a regulator that we can attribute the"
No," Quite a bit matters for consumers , wellbeing and , moreover , one in which we have a regulator that has repeatedly experimented with the design of its course , and this is the Medicare Advantage - Health Insurance Market . Now , within this Market every year nearly"
No," 65 million people are going to choose a health insurance plan and quality scores are going to help them choose those that have good medical and service quality , meaning that they 're going to summarize things like their access to primary care . Physician . The quality of the primary"
No," And inherently , this is because Medical Advantage is a highly concentrated market and when a firm with Market power thinks about how much quality to invest in it thinks about the effect on its marginal consumer right . The marginal value quality for the margin of consumer"
No," going to be thinking about what is known as monotone partitional designs . The only restriction here is basically the strictly greater quality falls on weekly , greater scores . We'Re going to be thinking about how many partitions do we want ? Where do we want to draw them ? They"
No," ages into this Market every year and they 're not affected by all the inertia that we know that exists in healthcare insurance , Market um , and we see that they really care about the star rating so condition on . Choosing a plan for Medicare Advantage"
No," oils equal they 're about 20 , more likely to choose a five star than a twostar plan , and this is basically all that we need and in terms of variation , to understand how to design scores . Because what we need is we need to understand the value"
No," , giving them more back more star ratings for the same investment , and how do we figure out the value ? Well , we 're seeing consumers trading off premiums for scores and we 're going to see how that changes as we change the definition of this course"
No," they 're going to have to form some beliefs about what their Rivals are doing and they 're going to do so to maximize expected profits . This expectations is not only about what my rivals are doing , but also about my own ability to control my body , because"
No," right and if I see one firm respond more than the other , then it must have a cost Advantage relative To the other , this is how we figure those things out : foreign s set their prices for older products that they offer in each County ."
No," The the known here is that the quality that they invested it invested in can affect their marginal cost of insurance . So if you invested in having the best hospitals in your network because to improve outcomes , well , the best hospitals are going to charge you more and that 's"
No," pointed out way back is that it 's not very clear how in healthcare markets you 're going to find out . What is your the quality that you 're facing and whether it 's even good right , because you might go , come out from a physician practice with a lot of pain and you"
No," if one year they 're willing to pay more for the same score when the scores are more informative or the information . There is more Salient about one type of Dimension : it means that they value more sort of the combination of information and quality . In that Dimension , and with a"
No," those at the Bottom , that are playing to asymmetric information and stealing demand from traditional Medicare or other Medicare Advantage plans , and when we look at those Investments relative to the design that there is in the market right , there 's weights that we"
No," put there . We really see that the higher , when we put too high of a contribution or a weight on a dimension relative to what consumers care about . We get over provision . We put too little we get under provision , and that gives us sort of a very intuitive way of thinking . Okay , this"
No," Rivals are doing because remember , Investments here are secretive and consumers are Going to change their beliefs about what it means to get a certain story . Solving this problem is rather tricky . Now , in a very simple sense , what is the"
No," of sub games over quality . So how do we deal with that ? We use a trick from the information design , literature we say well . Instead of thinking about designs about scores is creating a distribution over quality , we can think about them as creating a"
No," distribution over consumers , posterior beliefs - and this is not only lower dimensional , but also it has some nice properties that we can use in terms of computation . So here 's what we get so the optimal design is an aggregator"
No," under invest relative to what maximizes welfare . This is Market power over quality , LS fence . So we want to take a step back and in this simple example , there is a single , efficient level of quality . So how about we partition there and just tell people"
No, granular score buckets because of the combination of imperfect competition and dispensing quality Distortion that Ben was talking about . I think this is a really cool insight and something that I personally kind of did n't have in mind before when thinking about these kind of
No," tradeoff that Ben is talking about uh empirically , but I think this is a cool Insight . I think the second key Insight in the paper is thinking about the design of the function . That 'S aggregating the specific measures to the aggregate score and he shows that how"
No," like the very specific details of how this function are designed , are really important for thinking about investments in welfare , and I think the main thrust of this part of the paper is that if The weights used in the aggregation , do n't sync well with preferences and"
No," consumers are good at Bayes rules . So they 're good at kind of linking these things up in Pre in practice once they see the star ratings , and so , of course this this , you know made me think why are we aggregating measures into scores and practice when thinking about it from a"
No," measures and then also understanding the aggregation with the weights , that you see in the right hand , side . There 'S obviously kind of a lot of information to process here . When thinking about the you know , Bayesian updating and having preferences over these dimensions , so"
No," talking about potentially including costly information processing as an element in this model . Here the way I 'm thinking about it . From an empirical standpoint is , if you have three scenarios , so take one scenario where consumers observe just star"
No," think could be interesting for future work . To add in this Dimension now going back and thinking about what are these assumptions imply for the empirical results in this paper ? I actually think uh not as much as one might think , reading the introduction , and so uh , at"
No," Medicare Design , and so what this is showing if you look at the square at the bottom and you look at the numbers at the top , is that really the ignorance assumption versus the informed Choice assumption here really matters a lot for thinking about the empirical design and"
No," thinking About , for example , how the Medicare design is uh is doing relative to other designs . Okay , so I think I 'm I 'm essentially out of time . So what I 'll do is I 'll I 'll just say . I think that there 's a lot of other Rich things uh in this paper uh"
No, I think that thinking about heterogeneous quality preferences here across consumers there 's some interesting comparative Statics that could be developed here and then I think that something that I know Ben has thought about a lot . I think there 's an
No," issue here when we 're thinking about Dynamic versus static investment in the paper . It 'S a static investment model . If we think about Dynamics and dynamic investment , then the you know when we think about the static model , it 's more likely to predict uh low investment ."
No," relative to a model with then in the consumers . So I think , there 's some interesting things to unpack here . Okay , so let me wrap up the main takeaway is that uh ? This is a really awesome paper . There 'S a lot of conceptual insights . The empirical work is very"
No," some work yeah thanks Ben , let 's see uh Tim had a question . Would you go to the mic Tim please so super cool not to make it more complicated , but this is an insurance market . So I just want to . I want to get"
No," them and then that and because the cost of insurance is not compensated equally across qualities . Basically , it 's fixed how much you paid for it will allow for this kind of selection that you 're talking about so forward to the next version of the paper it 's going to have"
No," write the next paper on Dynamic design , where you link these two things , because I think it 's inherently super interesting to thinking about linked scoring design and pay for performance , because they are not only in this market they 're in almost every Market that we"
Environment," Look at where we have scores so like in education . We have this kind of pay for performance with scoring design with disclosure , and I think that these are two very important questions . They do n't like calling it The bribe , they call it a subsidy , but we have to think about it"
No, question was on thinking about how simple you should go . I this this big Insight that you should have a simpler quality score rating is really cool . I mean . How would you think about how far to take that should we think about it seems like maybe even one threshold
No," um said : I 'm not I 'm ignoring sort of the cost of processing information right , so the cost of Simplicity or the value of Simplicity , so the the simplest monotone partitional score you can have is a linear aggregator with one cutter , which is the sticker case , which I showed"
No," the fact that the scoring design changes regularly uh , but presumably when you 're , when you 're solving for the optimal scoring design , you 're thinking of it as like a steady state . And so it sounded like a lot of the things you would do to invest . In quality , given a scoring design"
No," , which it may not be it would how that would fact like the the results . Absolutely so I think that right now so so , Medical Advantage is dominated by the kind of the four Usual Suspects of American health insurance right and so and - and you think that , like United and"
No," reduced form responding quickly and and I 'm saying all those that do not They'Re inefficient , but in reality some of them are just new , and so that 's part of what my hopes are about . The kind of the more Dynamic paper that I hope to do later is kind of tell apart , who is inefficient"
No," versus who is just new and has n't sort of ramped up to have this kind of Baseline , fixed cost investment kind of put the level there such that They can actually respond as quick as the sort of the regulation asks them to , and so I I hope , that 's more or less what what you"
No," entry right , I think it 's okay ish , but you know if we 're really thinking about sort of the additional benefit of taking these new firms , these small firms and the additional competitive benefits that they could have if we allow them to ramp Up and become good , then then , I 'm not"
No," Regatta how they actually get their quality done . I interviewed the head of the ma analytics uh Chief kind of in uh in one of these large insurance companies , and I have them . How do you get these changes ? Because I see the changes here and kind of the the idea that they"
No," told me is that they have staff that follows up on patients and they say okay . This is uh plans that we want them to be five stars , and so it means that you know our population needs to have you know 95 and over uh um pneumonia vaccines , okay , and so what"
No," would be some matching of people 's preferences for quality and the value of quality , but uh uh . The quite there 's a question of how um you , how you would exhibit the value attached to Quality in terms of what you could pay or be paid to join one Medicare Advantage plan over"
No," thinking about basically a relatively High fixed cost and potentially redone an entry into different kind of quality levels , so , basically we 're getting rather than having Investments . I 'M getting draws of trying to figure out how to improve quality and and they 're all"
Environment," Hi there , my name is Richard McMunn from the interview training company past my interview com , and in this tutorial I will teach you how to pass a healthcare interview , so it does not matter which organization you are being interviewed to join or which role you are applying"

No," communication and decisionmaking skills to find a solution . For example , in a previous healthcare role , I was speaking to a confused patient who was upset about their treatment . I took the necessary steps to calm them down . Ask them questions about how they felt"
No," reassured them and showed empathy before taking them through their treatment plan until they were fully aware of its purpose and exactly what was going to happen to them . Moving forward by communicating with them clearly and by showing empathy and understanding , I was"
No," standard , and it must always come first . You must show empathy , understanding and compassion for people and communicate in a way that they understand , and that also helps to eliminate fear and anxiety . You must also show courage by dealing with difficult situations , when you need to"

No," These transitions occur between assisted living , assisted living memory care and skilled nursing known as our care center as a care navigator . I follow up with residents regarding"

No," , village , assisted living and memory care . Today , i 'm going to talk to you about assisted living and memory care , friendship , village , assisted living and memory care , or formerly known , as"
No," has a private dining room off to the side , a library , our own beauty , salon , activity , room , spacious , family areas and the most important 24hour nursing oversight . We have outside balconies on each floor"
No," that the residents can enjoy the weather . In 2013 , we added our first memory care neighborhood , which was located on our south hall . On the third floor and most recently in 2020 , we opened our new memory care neighborhood"
No," , assisted living communities , provide help with activities of daily living or referred to as adls . Those adls consist of help with showering or dressing medication management , which includes diabetes management"
No," , meal preparation , one person transfer assistance , meaning we can help you transfer from your bed to your walker or wheelchair or out of a chair and then , of course , our memory care services ."
Environment," daily living , but we are licensed and regulated by the state of missouri . When we have our annual survey , the inspectors come to look at our life , safety and pathway to safety protocols . They"
Environment," look at food safety , infection control and our nursing plans of care and then , of course , our wellness and socialization programming . Your care is directed by your primary care , physician or our medical director"
Environment," have to meet what 's called a pathway to safety , meaning in case of emergency residents , can evacuate their apartment and get to an area of safety in a timely manner . We talked about transferring independently and also"
No," in the building medical care coordination between you , your family and your primary care , physician assistance with the adls that we Spoke of earlier , the help with your showers and dressing daily bed , making your medication"
No," dining room and our church services , so we do also provide additional services at an additional cost to you , and those things would include laboratory or radiology services . We do"
No," If you choose for friendship village , to do your laundry , we would be happy to do so or your family can come and do your laundry as well . It 'S totally up to you . We also have an incontinence care program"
No," and Again , that would be on your statement at the end of the month , so what we offer in our assisted living building sets us apart from other communities , with the opening of our memory care neighborhood this year we created"
No," three levels of care within assisted living . We have our traditional assisted living area , but we also have two designated memory care neighborhood areas . So the first of our memory care neighborhoods , is our bridge neighborhood ."
No," went over previously , plus they have a dedicated nursing aid for this neighborhood , which provides consistency with the care there 's a caregiver to resident ratio of one to ten both day and night . The staff there help"
No," in the bridge , neighborhood and assistance in the the main , dining room . Also in this area , we do have secured doors if needed . So our most recent addition to our assisted living building is our brand new memory care"
Environment," neighborhood . This is a complete memory , care , environment and program , which consists of 15 private suites . We have specially designed secured spaces promoting interaction and engagement with our residents ."
No," in on all their sensories . We have an added piece of technology to our memory care neighborhood , which is called in2l , or it 's never too late . This piece of innovative technology allows the resident to remain , engaged"
No," and connected with the world around them . Also , we have a dedicated team of caregivers to provide the care for our residents in this neighborhood . Our caregiver to resident ratio is one to five during the day and one to eight"
No," overnight another thing , and , quite frankly , the most exciting thing that sets us apart from any other memory care neighborhood in the community is our programming . The staff and caregivers are trained and"
No, This is a personcentered model of care . It focuses on each resident 's abilities versus their disability . It takes a look at who they are where they have been in their life and how we can tap in to their strengths versus their weaknesses .
No," It allows the resident to be engaged and serve a purpose in their community . Our fulltime memory care director and our life enrichment assistant play a pivotal role in this program so who can join us in assisted living ? Well , basically , anyone that qualifies"
No," do n't have assisted living in their life care , contract or those that live out in the greater community , and these individuals will pay our private pay rates . Finally , i often get asked well how do i move"
No," to assisted living ? What 'S the process ? First of all , i would have you discuss with your family , or you could discuss with amy meek our care navigator . You also could call our assisted living specialist for a tour ."
Environment," Once you make that decision , an assessment would have to be done to make sure that you qualify again . We want to see that you can transfer independently . Can you meet a pathway to safety ? Is there any cognitive impairment"
No," , incontinence concerns etc . Thank you everyone for listening . I hope you enjoyed the information and i look forward to meeting you whenever you 're ready , hi . My name is stacy zurban and i am the administrator for the village care"
No," center . The village care center is 144 skilled , nursing beds on between three floors . The first floor is dedicated to shortterm rehab . The second floor is dedicated to memory"
No, interac program . We are becoming a montessori program provider for our memory care area . A lot of people wonder how do i get admitted into the village care center admissions to the village care center ?
No," Come from the hospital other sniffs homes in the community , our independent living and our assisted living residents under skilled care come to the village care center . After an acute illness"
No," in which they are covered by their insurance , our longterm care residents are in the vcc because they are not able to return or remain in their home due to physical or mental capabilities . Our clinical liaisons will help"
No," admission and a current list of medications . What insurance plans are accepted at the vcc ? We accept traditional medicare , aetna essence , united healthcare and humana . What is included in a life care contract ?"
No," A life care contract includes a room that includes cable television and a telephone general nursing care , medication , distribution , assistance with their activities of daily living"
Environment," with a private bath and an electric bed . The vcc also offers different therapy options . Select rehabilitation is friendship , village 's therapy provider , they provide skilled therapy , part b therapy , outpatient therapy and"
No," If you are being skilled under your insurance , the frequency of your physician visit must be weekly . A lot of people ask . Do we have memory care ? We have a 48 bed memory care floor , utilizing the montessori lifestyle"
No, This floor contains a dining kitchen area and also an activity area . Music and memories program is also available . On this floor . You may be wondering how to use your longterm care insurance at the village
No, care center . Most plans have a 3060 or 90day requirement before you are eligible to utilize . Your longterm care insurance bring your coverage letter either to accounting or social services to initiate coverage for you in the care
No, center . You will be . You will continue to pay your monthly service fee and the longterm care insurance will reimburse you directly . We will assist with paperwork required for your claim submission .
No," Thank you so much for allowing me to tell you a little bit more about the village care center . If you have any questions , just call friendship , villages , mainline and ask for stacy zurban i 'd be glad to help you anytime , you need it . I hope you found"
Environment," There are also a fair number of people beginning to do cognitive rehabilitation and this kind of gets back to your question of well . What can you do , and so this is one example of a cognitive rehabilitation technique that has some has some evidence . That is successful . So"
Environment," it 's called memory and attention training was developed by a colleague of mine and when I was up at Dartmouth for quite a few years and basically it has several components so one of which is sort of an educational component . So , just to talk about cognitive airs and"
No," different types of attention and memory , and we have a tendency to kind of when we have a problem . We have a tendency to think that . Well , everything was perfect before , but now I have a problem . Well , in fact , cognitive errors are very common . You know I make cognitive errors every"
No," day . I forget things I misspeak , I ca n't find words and you all did too before you ever had a cancer diagnosis , so part of it 's important to keep in mind that the goal of a treatment is to kind of get us back to . As close to you know , sort of the same level of cognitive errors"
No," that everybody else makes not perfect memory , not perfect concentration and that sort of thing there are compensatory strategies that that people use . I mean we 're we 're sort of in an electronic age , and so people are taking advantages of electronics . For"
Environment, the concept of trying to schedule things so that you do n't have multiple deadlines on the same day and that sort Of thing is often very helpful . This self instructional training is something that my colleague is used and it 's it really kind of goes back to the way in which we
Environment," internally , but it 's really a way of keeping ourselves on track and keeping ourselves organized again . Sleep hygiene fatigue management . You could put exercise underneath there because you know exercise is probably one of the best ways of improving sleep and and"
Environment, reducing stress . But there is some evidence and there have n't been any studies in in on cognitive functioning and cancer patients . But in older adults there have been studies showing that exercise can have a positive effects on cognition . So there needs to be studies
Environment," done looking at the effect of exercise on cognitive functioning in cancer survivors and and as there are people I know that are beginning to move in that area . But there are n't any results yet , but it makes sense that that would be something that would be beneficial . And I"
Environment," personally recommend that to everyone to just try to up your exercise level , to the to the extent that you can and even and you do n't have to be going to a gym and lifting weights and using power machines , you can use just walking . You know swimming biking , whatever you know"
Environment, routine as much as possible . So that it 's something that you can you know sort of have as part of just a daytoday activity for some people - or you know again stress and anxiety - are our issues . Things like relaxation exercises meditation
No," in yoga . You know it depends again on on your preferences . I think there are many roads to relaxation you know Taichi , you know almost any any of these approaches can be beneficial but to the extent that we can keep ourselves"
Environment," interesting initial results in terms of both neuropsychological testing and quality of life . People are beginning to take the next step and actually use the fMRI the functional MRI to see , though , if you go through this kind of training , do you actually see changes in your"
No," RASMUS HOUGAARD: There is a general huge misconception around mindfulness. Many people think that mindfulness is a spiritual thing. Many think that it's a private thing that we do at home, and most people think that mindfulness is about slowing down. That's wrong. Mindfulness, in short terms, is really about speeding up our mental processes whereby we can be more effective with whatever we're doing, that we have this attentional muscle"
No," But when you're in the present moment, even if you're doing a task you don't particularly like, you'll actually feel happier. But also what we know is that you'll be able to be more productive when you're in that state because you're going to be naturally focused. JON KABATZINN: People misunderstand meditation as oh, I just sweep all my thoughts away and then I'm in this like nirvana. What you'll get by trying to sweep all your thoughts away is a headache at the most, because"
No," there's no way to sweep your thoughts away. They will get you every time. And then you can have millions of thoughts about mindfulness and meditation and those are just thoughts, too. They're not meditating. But when you see that you're not your thoughts then you can watch them in this kind of impersonal, more sort of if you will observing way with kindness, with selfcompassion, because a"
No," So, for instance, every experience you've ever had, every emotion, the anger you felt yesterday or a year ago isn't here anymore. It arises and it passes away, and if it comes back in the present moment by virtue of your thinking about it again it will subside again when you're no longer thinking about it. Now, this is something that people tend not to notice because we rather than merely feel an emotion like anger, we spend our time thinking of all the reasons why we have every right to be angry."
No," So the conversation keeps this emotion in play for much, much longer than its natural halflife. And if you're able through mindfulness to interrupt this conversation and simply witness the feeling of anger as it arises you'll find that you can't be angry for more than a few moments at a time. If you think you can be angry for a day or even an hour without continually manufacturing this emotion by thinking without knowing that you're thinking, you're mistaken."
No," And this is something you can just witness for yourself. Again, this is an objective truth claim about the nature of subject of experience and it's testable. And mindfulness is the tool that you would use to test it. DANIEL GOLEMAN: Mindfulness allows us to shift our relationship to our experience. Instead of getting sucked into our emotions or our thoughts which is what happens when we're depressed or anxious, we see them as those thoughts again or those feelings again."
No," And that disempowers them. There's actually research at UCLA that shows when you can name that feeling – oh, I'm feeling depressed again – you have shifted the activity levels neurologically in the part of the brain which is depressed to the part of the brain which notices, which is aware of the prefrontal cortex and that diminishes the depression and enhances your ability to be able to understand it or to see it as just a feeling. SEPPÄLÄ: Meditation practices can really help you observe your mind, become aware of"
Environment," its tendencies. For example, its tendency to wander, and help you through that awareness of shift your attention back into the present moment. Meditation is an exercise in which you are engaging fully with the present moment. So it's a fantastic way to train your mind to be more present with what is going on right now. KABATZINN: When you start to watch the mind you'll notice that its got a lot of agendas"
No," It's not like oh, I've transcended greed. I don't think we do transcend greed, but we can transform how we are in relationship to it and with awareness the greed doesn't have to run us. So we can bring mindfulness to greed, and the greed can be attenuated or liberated. Mindfulness to aversion, and the aversion could be attenuated or liberated, or mindfulness to our own deluded nature, thoughts and emotions and so forth. And that is liberating of them."
Environment," You'll have the same bank account. You'll have the same social security number. You'll have the same face in the mirror. You'll be aging every day, but you will be in wiser relationship to your possibilities. SAM HARRIS: The enemy of mindfulness and really of any meditation practice is being lost in thought. Is to be thinking without knowing that you're thinking."
No," Now, the problem is not thoughts themselves. We need to think. We need to think to do almost anything that makes us human – to reason, to plan, to have social relationships, to do science. Thinking is indispensable to us, but most of us spend every moment of our waking lives thinking without knowing that we're thinking, and this automaticity is a kind of scrim thrown over the present moment through which we view everything and it's distorting of our lives."
No," It's distorting of our emotions. It engineers our unhappiness in every moment because most of what we think is quite unpleasant. We're judging ourselves, we're judging others, we're worrying about the future. We're regretting the past. We're at war with our experience in subtle or coarse ways and much of this selftaught is unpleasant and diminishing our happiness in every moment. So meditation is a tool for cutting through that, for interrupting this continuous conversation"
No," we're having with ourselves. GOLEMAN: If you do mindfulness practice ten minutes a day or ten minutes three times over the course of a day something remarkable happens to your attention and that has to do with the fact that we're all multitasking these days. People on average look at their email about 50 times a day. They look at their Facebook 20 some times a day, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's Instagram, there's your phone calls, there's whatever it is you have to do."
Environment, And what this means for attention is that we're challenged. That focused attention is an endangered species. PETER BAUMANN: What happens with attention is it either goes to the highest opportunity or it goes to the highest threat that we perceive in our environment. So suddenly there is something that we in our huntergatherer times something that was valuable to eat and then that's where our attention goes. Or there's something like a dark shadow moving and then that's where our attention goes.
No," It's automatic and the reason that we have attention is to pay attention and then summon all of our resources to either take advantage of the opportunity. or to avoid the threat. That's really the purpose of attention. So we zone out everything else, we kind of blank everything and just focus on one thing in that particular moment is of highest value or potentially the highest threat. There is so much happening in our lives that we pay attention to and quite frankly the"
No," ever, pay attention to just being present. And that is really what mindfulness and meditation is trying to balance out a little bit, so that when the mind quiets and you actually are at home in your body, then that distraction fades away and you actually get in touch with that underlying happiness that the Greeks call eudaimonia. SEPPÄLÄ: Research shows that people who meditate can increase their attention span. In fact, in some research studies we use a task called the attentional blink task in"
Environment," which you show people a number of different images in very fast sequence and usually we would only pick up every fourth image. We don't actually see the others. That's why we call it the attentional blink. Well, research has shown that after meditation retreat people tend to not show that attentional blink or to show it less which is very interesting. It means that if we calm our mind we're somehow able to pick up things better in our environment"
No," ourselves, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, doing anything but being focused on what's happening right now. Meditators not only turn off the default mode network of their brain while they're meditating, but even when they're not meditating. In other words, meditators are setting a new default mode. And what's that default mode? They're focused on what's happening right now."
No," WENDY SUZUKI: We know a lot about or we're growing our knowledge about the effects of meditation, longterm meditation in people like monks that meditate for 50 or 50,000 hours in their lifetime. And we know that this completely changes the electrophysiological responses of their brains. They have much higher levels of what we call gamma waves which is a particular frequency of wave. GOLEMAN: All of us get gamma for a very short period when we solve a problem we've been"
No," What was stunning was that the Olympic level meditators – these are people who have done up to 62,000 lifetime hours of meditation – their brainwave shows gamma very strong all the time as a lasting trait just no matter what they're doing. It's not a state effect. It's not during their meditation alone, but it's just their everyday state of mind. We actually have no idea what that means experientially. Science has never seen it before."
No," We also find that in these Olympic level meditators when we ask them, for example, to do a meditation on compassion their level of gamma jumps 700 to 800 percent in a few seconds. This has also never been seen by science. So we have to assume that the special state of consciousness that you see in the highest level meditators is a lot like something described in the classical meditation literature centuries ago, which is that there is a state of being which is not like our ordinary state. Sometimes it's called liberation, enlightenment, awake."
No," The science is really compelling. It shows that meditation can boost your immune system, lower your blood pressure, help you deal with problems ranging from irritable bowel syndrome to psoriasis. And the neuroscience is where it really gets scifi. There was a study out of Harvard that's shows that short, daily doses of meditation can literally grow the gray matter in key areas of your brain having to do with selfawareness and compassion and shrink the gray matter in the area associated with stress."
No," GOLEMAN: Beginners in mindfulness or other meditations it turns out right from the get go have a better reaction to stress. What that means is that – and we see this in brain function. The area of the brain which reacts to stress called the amygdala, it's the trigger point for the fight or flight or freeze response. It's what makes us angry all of a sudden or anxious all of a sudden. The amygdala is quieter."
No, It's calmer in the face of stress and this lets us be calmer in the face of stress. And this is another benefit that we see right from the beginning. LOSANG SAMTEN: We all need that peace of mind. So the peace of mind comes from the mindfulness. Through that we understand how important kindness or compassion. One mental good quality leads into the next and the next and the next. Life is not perfect.
Environment," Life will never be perfect. How much we put into effort to be perfect, there is no perfect everything. We are human. Patience is wonderful to have. So, if somebody who is in your life, if he or she is so stressful and at that time sometimes not necessarily there's not much room for communicating, just be patient. Just be (breathing noise)."
No," GOLEMAN: One of the most important things whether you're looking in the Christian literature or the Buddhist literature or Jewish literature or Hindi literature, it doesn't matter. All of the meditative traditions within those classical schools of thought are saying the most important thing is that you become less focused on yourself, caring only about yourself, less selfish as it were and more open to the needs of others. More compassionate, more caring, more present to other people. If you look at longer term meditators, people who've done more than say 1,000 or 2,000 hours"
No," of meditation over their entire life – and this happens naturally. Let's say you do a half hour or sit every morning before you go out for the day. Well, after a decade or two it does add up and it seems that cumulative amount does make people less selfish, less just caring about me, and more open to other people around them. More caring, more able to tune in, more able to empathize. And this also shows up in a brain change which we think is quite significant which is that the nucleus accumbens which is the focus of craving of I've got to have that drug addiction,"
No," for example, actually becomes smaller in longer term meditators. And this seems to be related to this lack of I, me, mine in how people behave and how they think in their emotional life. And we see it most strikingly, of course, in Olympic level meditators where these are people who've done 10,000 to 62,000 hours of meditation and they are genuinely selfless people but they're very nourishing, very enjoyable to be with because they pay attention to you. They really focus on the person they're with and how they can be of service or what do"
No," you need now. It's very refreshing. SUZUKI: How do you get to be a regular meditator and the answer is, I think, start very, very small. I know for myself I have a subchapter in my book called ""Confessions of a YoYo Meditator"" because I think I have tried all different kinds of meditation. And my big mistake early on was to try and meditate for too long at a sitting."
No," So I would try and meditate for 2025 minutes with no meditation experience and it was a disaster. I forced myself to do it for 30 days thinking that would be it and I would form my habit. And day 31 I took a little break and I never came back. But then when I came back again starting very, very small with things that I can just do on my own, just breathing meditation, focusing on the breath. Something that we all do at the end of yoga classes."
No," That's what really kind of helped me build my muscle and I just have to stick with that very short meditation and build it up that way. I think people too often either start too long or don't stick with it enough, but again shorter is better. DAN HARRIS: My powers of prognostication are not great. I bought a lot of stock in the company that made palm pilot back in 2000 and that didn't go so well for me, but having said that I'm going to make a prediction."
Environment," I think we're looking at meditation as the next big public health revolution. In the 1940s if you told people that you went running they would say who's chasing you. Right now if you tell people you meditate, and I have a lot of experience with telling people this, they're going to look at you like you're a little weird most of the time. That's going to change. Meditation is going to join the pantheon of no brainers like exercise, brushing your teeth and taking the meds that your doctor prescribes to you."
No," These were all things that if you don't do you feel guilty about and that is where I think we're heading with meditation because the science is so strongly suggestive that meditation can do really, really great things for your brain or for your body. DAMIEN ECHOLS: This is a technique that flushes our thoughts out. If you have a song going through your head over and over or if you're reliving an argument you had with someone a year ago, if you're obsessed over something that you can't get out of your head."
No," This technique is good for that as well as just generally meditation purposes. It doesn't have a name. I usually just refer to as the prison cell meditation, but if you're interested I'll do that. Is that okay? All right. You start by closing your eyes and then you envision yourself in a prison cell."
No," Standing in the center of a cell, everything is white. The walls are white, the ceiling is white, the floors are white. The only thing there is in the cell other than you on the back wall is a slit of a window. And it's up so high that the only way that you can reach it, the only way you can see out of it is by gripping the window ledge high above your head and hoisting yourself up by sheer brute physical upper body strength, almost like you're doing a pull up or a chin up."
No," And as you start to lift yourself up off the floor using just your arms, try to feel what that would actually feel like. Feel the muscles in your shoulders. Feel the muscles in your chest, in your abdomen firing, tensing as you're pulling yourself up. Try to feel what the wall would feel like as you scrape against it lifting yourself slowly by sheer strength."
No," ledge. Begin to raise yourself slowly up by sheer strength feeling the muscles in your shoulders, your chest, your torso straining as you lift your body weight. Feel the wall of the prison cell as you scrub against it. And as your eyes go over the edge of the window frame white light comes flooding in obliterating everything. And this is one of those things you can do for as long as you have time."

No," Hello , lovely people hi , i 'm jessica , for those of you who are new here who came across this video because you got a little bit nervous and typed into google does getting a mobility aid mean that you 've given up or maybe you got sent this video because uh"
No," , Maybe you told someone who 's interested in getting a mobility aid that they would be giving up . Oh friend , that 's not great , i 'm sure you were well intentioned but ouch . Let 'S talk about mobility , aids , what they"
No," genetic disabilities , one that affects my nerves and more than affects my connective tissue . That 'S ready for northeast liability , depression policies and elderly syndrome with associated postural or static attack . Gladiator syndrome . Don'T worry , there 's not a test"
No," pain , is pretty much the great summary that you need uh deafness . It also causes deafness . I 'M deaf that 's a thing and i 'm blind in one eye . I noticed that a lot less i have over my nose really noticed my nose such a big nose . You never realize how big your nose is until you"
No," even when using my wheelchair , i generally can still stand up and there are moments where i 'm required to do so , such as transferring from chair to wheelchair or into a car or going into an excitement . Or you know going into an inaccessible building because i live in"
No, doctor is n't quite sure how to prevent that one . Yet so it freaks me out and we 're just going to brush over it . I made a series of videos about finding the perfect mobility aid for me and there 's a lot of info in that series . You can watch it by clicking the card in the top
No," left hand corner of the screen or by going to the link in the description , but spoiler alert , an electric wheelchair ended up being the best option . For me , one of the most asked questions through the series , though , and one i still get asked now - was - does getting mobility aid"
No," mean you 're , giving up oh honey , let 's break that down . Firstly , what is a mobility aid ? A mobility aid is a device designed to assist , walking or otherwise improve the mobility of people with a mobility impairment , including this are"
No," wheelchairs , mobility , scooters , zimmer frames , crutches , canes gate , trainers , scooters or even sterling . It 'S all about creating a freedom of movement similar to that of unassisted , walking or standing up from a chair . You might not have considered this option even but a"
No," white cane and a guide dog can also be thought of as mobility aids , since they help a person have a level of mobility they would not otherwise enjoy , and what does giving up mean ? Well , it is n't nice . It 'S definitely not a kind thing to tell"
No," should hold off as long as possible before you sit down in that wheelchair , regardless of the pain you 're in now , because the only step after that is a bed and then doom . Yet we all have entirely different journeys when it comes to the twisting roads . Our bodies"
No," , because there was a downturn . A mobility aid helps you to regain the things you 'd started to lose and worried . You 'D never get back one of the best pieces of advice about mobility . Aids is , if it 's annoying to use it , you do n't need it . If it 's not annoying to use it , you need it"
No," , i 'm not talking about . Is it annoying because other people act irritated ? They have to lift your mobility into the car , or is it annoying because you feel embarrassed when people look at you as you enter a room , both of which are fully justified feelings to have , but not to"
No," the extent you cause yourself physical damage because you 're pushing Your body past the point where you 'd had a bloody set down . Also , if you 're asking me whether you need a mobility aid or not , you probably already know the answer to that question . I personally do n't use my"
No," around us . That obviously make you look gorgeous , even when you are feeling your worst and it is such a confidence boost . We set up our house to be child friendly to our baby , so he can be independent , but also so i can interact with him easily . I do n't bend over . I just lie next to him"
No," , tiny old island and we are working with what we have got and building on top of victorian things . I also do n't use my wheelchair in exactly the same way all year round , because my condition is very changeable at some points . Conserving energy is the most important thing"
No," towards it , which , since it changes every day , is a little difficult . But that 's the idea , that 's the thing called pacing learning , where your energy limits ah - and i have a video about it , which you can watch by clicking the card up here or the link in the description down below"
No," next day i 'll be exhausted . Rather than feeling fine , so if you feel like you 're already cutting down on things in your life because they do n't fit within the limits of your pain or energy , then how could using a mobility age would allow you to use the same amount of energy of"
No, comfortable . Doing but accomplish far more ever possibly be giving up it . Can'T it is n't a mobility aid is not an innately bad negative thing . Just like disability is not
No," time , though . A mobility aid is just an aid to your life and to helping you live the best version of it . If it 's the right time for you to use a mobility aid and if you 're , watching this video and doing lots of research and thinking about all of your"
No," Hello, lovely people! Welcome to what will hopefully, be the first episode in a series about Powered Mobility Aids, a subject that makes me feel queasy in my stomach. Not at the thought of needing a mobility aid, or even the slight feeling of embarrassment when"
No," Wow. So, my complex fears about money and difficulty spending money on myself have crushed together with a horrible, weird, disability feelings and I just want to do the right thing, but All right, ""What are mobility aids?"" I hear you ask."
No," Well, a mobility aid is a device that is designed to help people who have problems moving around in order to gain greater independence. Obvious examples would be a walking stick, or a wheelchair. We've all seen the symbol for disability, after all. But it's worth bearing in mind that"
No," Or, because they have fatigue problems, or blood pressure issues. All of these, all of the above. Mobility aids can be used as a preventative as well as a cure. If it takes you this much energy to walk down the street on your wobbly legs, or"
No," this much energy to walk down the street with a cane, then it's a It's pretty obvious It's a pretty obvious choice, wouldn't you say? Says the girl who's put off buying a new mobility aid for the last 10 years. You know Yeah, okay, I've got absolutely no excuse here."
No," I'm doing it now, okay? It's happening! I had to make a series on my YouTube channel to make myself do it, but, it's happening! The mobility aids I currently use are a manual wheelchair and a pair of crutches. Which are great for when my hips are really painful,"
No," And I want to be able to leave the house and by myself I'll go to the shops, which I can't do on foot for both energy and pain reasons, and I can't do my manual wheelchair because I live in Brighton, which apparently is just one big hill. I mean, no one informed me of this when I first moved here even though I used my"
No," wheelchair much more then. If this is me struggling on a carpet, imagine me trying to go up a hill. So, I'm only looking at powered ones, and the two options being a mobility scooter, which is generally like a cross between a motorbike and a toddler's souped up tricycle."
No," It therefore, doesn't rely on your arm strength or someone else's thigh muscles to move. These are much smaller, obviously, since they're similar to manual wheelchairs and can turn on their own circle rather than the big loop that scooters have to make. Being small means they fit in corridors and"
No," Which is so silly because clearly they look medical, they're designed to fulfill a medical purpose. But still, I have some medical trauma and it makes me feel sick inside. Often we don't address how physical health and the difficult experiences it puts us through, negatively impact our mental health."
No," Buying a mobility aid is like buying a car. It's really expensive, it's important to get the right fit, and there are a stupid number of addons to consider. And, if you made the wrong decision, you're going to be really annoyed with yourself. Also, if you get something really flashy, people will assume you're overcompensating for"
No," something. Just saying. So I thought it was important to make the powered mobility aid version of the millions of ""Which car?"" Videos on YouTube. This video is the first of a fourpart series that I will be releasing over the next few weeks."
No," reading them and they will probably help me to actually decide on what I actually end up with. So thank you in advance. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just a girl looking for her perfect mobility aid and this is hopefully my journey towards finding it. Because this is going to be a damp squib of"
No," a series if I don't. I realized that I was being a dumbdumb about not getting myself a motorized aid when I found myself, for the fifth day in a row, lying on my bed and crying from my soul about the pain in my legs. My body pain is pretty easy to manage day by day"
No," So, Claud and I headed to our nearest large mobility aid showroom and decided that we were going to try things out. Hello! We are in the car in a car park, if you hadn't gathered. Wow! So exciting! Yeah, today's entire video is just going to be"
No," potentially lifeaffirming. That made it sound like [Claudia] You built it up so much! [Jessica] we were here to get a baby! That's not this video yet, I'm sorry. You have to wait for that one. No, I'm going to be trying out mobility scooters,"
No," because we've finally decided it's ridiculous. I need one, I can't keep pretending I don't. Yeah, it'll be so nice and you can go for dog walks without like, having to think, ""Do I have enough energy to go for this dog walk?"" Obviously now that we live by a park that's got pavement. I can leave my house."
No," accessibility, Claudia! Also, it's a mobility scooter so if the drop curb is on the other side of the road. Oh yeah, I won't mind walk Yeah, you won't mind! Walking? In your normal wheelchair you're like,"
No," ""Oh, for god sake,"" because it means you have to Too far, too far! I like this thinking. From a practical sense you need to look at like, the amount of power it can generate. Can it go up a hill? What's the battery capacity? What's its distance?"
No," power chair or mobility scooter, rather than what I go for within those categories. Because that feels like a really big difference to me. What is your favorite scooter, then? My favorite scooter, I think, was the red one that you could get in silver because I felt like it had a really good amount of space for me to put my feet."
No," Brighton and saw three steps. Like you said, you wouldn't be able to get in with your chair and you don't want to leave your chair just on the pavement. But with a mobility scooter, I don't think you'd mind so much leaving it out. Yeah, because you take the key out."
No," Yeah, chairs are way more expensive. And that's not including VAT. And then the scooter that you liked was 699 pounds. It also felt if I was going down a hill, I'd definitely feel more secure in the mobility scooter because I've got my little I just realized the air con was on, sorry,"
No," so there might just all sound really like (loud whooshing) Oh no! Oh, Claudia But yeah, if I'm going down a hill in my mobility scooter, then because my arms are already out, so I feel,"
No," so you can't really do that with a scooter. No. True. Firstly, I think the idea is it gets you places, and then you can have a bit of your energy reserved to do what you were going to do in that place. But at least you haven't used up the energy to"
No," we don't know what it's going to be like. Then we can bring it up ahead and be like, ""Is it okay to use a mobility scooter?"" And they'd be like, ""Oh yeah you can stick to the paths,"" so then (mumbles) then we get to where the café is, and you have to go down some steps, at least you can just park your scooter there and"
No," a power chair does seem more ""disabled."" I would kind of worry sometimes that I would be going around in the mobility scooter, and someone would assume I'd stolen my grandmother's mobility scooter. But in a power chair, they'd just assume it was mine. Do you know what I mean?"
No," I think with a power chair, people will think you're more chairbound. Whereas with scooter it's more to do with saving energy. That's probably really bad but that's generally what the perception is, isn't it? You don't see an old lady and think, ""Oh dear, you're scooterbound."""
No," You just think You're scooterbound ""Oh you just can't walk very fast."" People would be less shocked if I got up from a mobility scooter. Although I don't think that should be a deciding factor on what other people think."
No," felt very freeing. It's hard to tell what something's actually like in real life when you've only seen it inside a showroom, however. So, the next move. Renting a mobility scooter for a week and then renting a power chair for a week, which you will"
No," see the first of in the very next mobility aid video, which should be out next week on Friday. Please do add your thoughts and any recommendations you may have into the comments section. Hey, if you happen to know about the perfect thing that fulfills all of my needs and is everything at once, then please do tell me."
No," Hi , my name is Jeff , I 'm a registered nurse with over 30 years experience in the medical field and I 'm part of Med marks customer service team . This is the Sarah study by our Joe Huntley , an independent mobility device to help increase mobility and independence at"

No," Hello , we have with us uh dr musharraf hussain , who is the chief executive of the academia institute here in nottingham and he 's with us to talk about the basic beliefs of islam and well shot off . Can you tell us what"
No," the basic beliefs are ? Well ? First of all , beliefs in arabic is iman , and it simply means to accept as truth , whatever the prophet of islam muhammad taught . So it 's having this unwavering belief and acceptance"
No," of first and foremost , of course , is belief in god , in an almighty god and and really that is it to be honest , the rest of the two major uh beliefs , that is the prophethood uh and the um hereafter"
No," all Revolve around this and , of course , we 'll be talking about the six beliefs angels , the books , the hereafter the predestination , but really it is all about one god , and all these other elements and tenets of the faith really reinforce"
No," the belief in one supreme almighty , allpowerful god really So these it 's really all about god and the six basic beliefs . So if we count them , let 's see , there 's god it 's angels , it 's messengers . It 'S books , it 's the last day and it 's"
No," people and of course you know . That is the only way that we can know god . So where does one look to find what these beliefs are ? Are there creeds ? Are there books ? I mean well , of course , the first and"
No," foremost source is the glorious quran itself . You know that is the source , but muslim scholars over the centuries have been trying to distill and to put it succinctly and package , it nicely into a creed similar to the"
No," christian creed , and we have many uh popular ones and the one which the hanafis in particular World over and the ashari 's use is called akaid anasafi , the beliefs of the great teacher of the 11th century nasafi ."
No," Okay , what are some of the other is the anasazi and the used mentioned hanafi and ashari . Can you just briefly say where this fits into the wider tradition ? The beliefs are really um . There are three ways of looking at"
No," and it is just the tone and the tenor in which they are and sometimes details . Actually , that 's the only difference , but otherwise i mean they are actually the same in in many respects . What is this word uh belief ? What 'S it mean ? I"
No, It builds a mindset . It builds a particular world view . That is what beliefs are really and by looking through this beliefs system . You begin to see the world
No," differently from people who might not have that belief really . So it is a very fundamental way of understanding the world and seeing the world and understanding . What 'S around you , how does belief then relate to works"
No," , because that 's a an issue in many religious traditions ? How does that fit together ? Well - and you know there is this notion that um belief gives you this basis of , relating with your creator , uh and therefore"
No," beliefs really have to be expressed physically and that 's what we 're about really and the uh the works are really . The deeds are really expression . Uh of our love and relationship with god , good one last quick question can can belief"
No," , increase and decrease , because i know that 's a fascinating debate amongst the muslim scholars and there is one view which is very simply that no , you know , faith does n't actually increase . It 'S like all or non in physiology . You know"
No," us understand about faith or belief . We use these two terms to mean to translate the arabic word iman , and now we move on to our additional videos . Thank you very much for being with us . You"
No," 100 000 people every day . It 'S also the holiest site in sikhism , the fifth largest and youngest of the world religions , a religion that preaches about love , peace and the equality of humankind"
No," , but also asks its followers to carry swords . So who are the six ? What do they believe , and why does everyone confuse them for muslims ? Well , let 's find out ."
No," earliest civilizations , the indus valley , civilization , persians , greeks , central asians , muggles , the british and others have all invaded here . I meant i meant mughals mughal mughals invaded here . Hinduism buddhism"
No," india 's population , but about sixty percent of the punjabs . The sick diaspora is spread out across the world with concentrations in the uk , canada , the us east , africa , australia and malaysia . Six . Interestingly enough make up about"
No," 15 percent of canada 's population , which is second only to india . The word sikh means learner , six call their religion , sikhi , gorsicki and gormat . You ca n't really understand the sixth without understanding their relationship with"

No," beliefs of sikhism 1 , one god , the sikh holy book , the guru , granth sahib 's opening sentence is just two words ich anker . There is only one god , nanak made sure it was clear that the focus was on"
No," one ick does n't just mean one . It is literally the numeral one one . God is by far the most important belief in sikhism . This may not be the kind of god you 're used to , though six believe in a formless genderless"
No," No religion had a monopoly on the truth . The next one could be known as vishnu allah , the tao yahweh , the algorithm or any other name or belief . There was no need to fight over whose god was the true god , as they"
No," were all the same . One recognize all mankind , whether muslim or hindu , as one the same god is the creator and nourisher of all recognize no distinctions among them . The"
No," temple and the mosque are the same , so are hindu , worship and muslim prayer . Human beings are all one guru gobind singh . The lack of agenda for this one god means that there is no difference between men and women in sikhism . Sikhism was among the first"
No, major world religions to make the radical suggestion that maybe just maybe women are people too . Women in sikhism have fought battles led religious services and even acted as some of the longest reigning leaders of
No," the entire community . Sikhism is n't based on doing things to get into some heaven or hell . Hell is just life on earth which your soul is constantly reborn into . After you die , which is a"
No," soul . One does this by realizing that you are already a part of god . You just need to let go of your ego when your soul remerges back into gods . This is called mukti , which is similar to hinduism 's moksha"
No," of rebirth and death guru and the neck thought that maya built a wall between people and god . The wall of maya is built with the five thieves lust anger , greed , attachment and pride . It is the duty of all six to avoid these"
No," the negative effects of ego , hindu versus muslim , israeli versus palestinian sitting , down wipers versus standing up wipers . All of these conflicts are caused by ego and maya . The guru grant sahib said it is"
No," not religion or race , but it is wealth that divides brothers , but guru nanak taught that there was an other direction . People could face by being a spiritual person , practicing compassion"
No," the three pillars . Three three pillars : the three pillars are one nam japo , which is meditation on god and the reciting and chanting of god 's name way guru . This is normally done in the morning and before bed . This is n't supposed to just be some"
No," community . The sikh tradition of a communal meal or longer at the gurdwaras is a part of wand . Chakna , the longer or communal free kitchen , inside of a sikh gurdwara , which is their equivalent of a mosque or church , is open to all who visit regardless of"
No," caste faith or gender . These serve vegetarian food to all , not because six have to be vegetarian , but simply because that means all people of all diets can partake . So if you want to taste typical punjabi food just go visit a gurdwara in guru"
No," , another vital part of sikhism that is n't one of the three pillars is seva , which is selfless service . True service to their community , six can become more humble and overcome their ego . Seva can include cleaning of the"
No," courtois preparing food or cleaning dishes in the lunger , or it can include volunteering building things for your community or subscribing and ringing . The notification bell on educational youtube channels , through"
No," remembering god 's name , honest work and sharing along with selfless service and avoiding the five thieves . A person can rid themselves of egoism and be released from the cycle of rebirth and death . 4 . The khalsa guru gobind rai"
No," distinct look from now on , so that they would always be compelled uphold sikh values . So in 1699 guru gobind brought his six together at anandapore . After their morning prayer , he stood in"
No," community called the celta . He offered them . Amrit a bowl of sweetened water and all five who belonged to different cast groups drank the amrit from the same bowl , which would have been a"
No," huge deal back . Then this signified they had joined a new castle family , the khalsa . Each of these volunteers had to leave behind their old surnames or cast names and adopt the same surname singh , which comes from the sanskrit word"
No," , tied together as one family , with one name without caste , with the goal of defending the weak and promoting justice . Today , many sixth still undergo the amret ceremony and take the surnames singh and core the cows . They were also"
No," turban , the vast majority of the time that person will be a sikh , not a muslim 5 . The guru grant sahib the guru grant sahib is the holy book of the six . It contains the teachings of the gurus and acts as a spiritual guide for"
No," sikhs around the world . It is probably one of the only holy books that contains not only the writings of the religion 's founders written by themselves rather than after their death , but also"
No," the writing of people from other religions . Writings of muslims and hindus can be found throughout , along with references to judaism , buddhism and christianity before his death . In 1708 , the 10th guru"
No," cover your head . Remove your shoes wash your hands as you enter , and do your best not to bring any drugs or tobacco inside the most important cruduary in the world is the harimander or golden temple in amritsar india , in 1604 guru arjan"
No," , completed work on the golden temple and had The guru granth sahib installed inside it as the gesture of religious tolerance guru , arjan , invited the muslim mian mir to lay the foundation stone of the golden temple . The temple has four"
No," doors : opening on all four sides to show the openness to all cultures and peoples , but on the inside , only one door leads the inner sanctum indicating that all paths and beliefs eventually lead to the"
No," one god the golan temple is the most visited Place in the world , with around 6 million visitors each year , the longer at the golden temple serves a free meal to about 100 000 people each day , making it the"
No," world 's largest free , serving kitchen all run and staffed by volunteers and the waiting list to volunteer in The golden temple has hundreds of thousands of names on it . The people on that list will be waiting"
Environment," guru , grand saheb , also available audible , makes it easier than ever to fit audiobooks into your schedule , whether you 're commuting cooking or , if you 're like me , pumping hot iron at the gym , you can be listening to some of the best"
Environment," audiobooks available , even offline with apps . On iphone ipad , android and windows phones being able to listen to audiobooks , while doing otherwise boring tasks has made me look forward to getting stuck in traffic , and now that we 've entered a new year"
No, listening to some of their personal fitness or selfimprovement audiobooks or you can be like me and dive into the analects of confucius . The bag vegeta or eat pray . Love . Don'T do n't you judge me . Elizabeth gilbert has woven a beautiful
No," different people , but learning even the basics of anything that millions of people deeply care about , gives you an insight into our fellow humans worldview , and i hope you enjoyed it . You can find all the sources used in the description"
No," Muahmuah very cold weather the good thing about family medicine is , you can make of it ? What you like , so I have a lot of interests and one of my interests is Public . Health and Environmental Health falls into that umbrella . So I was"
Environment," to look at it from the media environment , which is your body . So what do you put into your body ? What do you put on your body and why ? What are those things ? Are they good for you ? Are they bad for you and then the external environment ? So this is what most people think about"
Environment," It 'S determined by your physical environment , your chemical environment , your social environment and your psychological environment , which is your mind , so I just kind of an easier way to look at that is it 's many different things that come together that affect"
Environment," your health . So your health is not just you know : you 're , sick or you 're , not sick . You , your health , depends on the choices you make . It depends the environment that you live in . It depends on what you were born with so genes . We ca n't change . There 'S a section"
Environment," there on genes genes are what your parents passed down to you . So that 's something that you do n't have control of , but your environment . You have control of to a certain extent and then your choices . As you all know , we have free choice , so our choices we do have some"
Environment," control . This is just an easier way to look at how these all of these things work together . So , let 's talk about the immediate environment , so I 'm going to focus more on products that people use who do we eat and then cleaning products , because these are things that we come"
No," found in plastics . So there are basically a plasticizer , so they 're used in detergents in clothes , in children 's toys in soaps , shampoos , all those kind of things - nail polish and even in cleaning products , and they have a lot of effects on the hormones . So , whenever you mess"
No," probably seen these on shampoos before they say , paraben free or you know , without parabens . These are preservatives , so these are used a lot in makeup they 're using foods and drugs . They basically preserve the product and they prevent bacteria from growing , but the"
Environment," of an organic natural brand - that 's called the olive tree . This is the other one and she did list her ingredients , so I 'm gon na pass these around . So just so you can do the exercise yourself and look at the ingredients , but I have them up here so because the chopstick did n't"
No," that you can actually pronounce so that 's another takehome point and we 'll get back to that in a little bit . You wan na look up products because you know when I first heard this . I took a course for six months on environmental health about this a lot , and this really scared"
No," you can type It in and I 'll tell you this is safe . This is not safe , etc . So that 's just a resource for you and that 's a photo of their website . So takehome message and a lot of you are thinking well , if these are not good for us , why are they ? Why are they put on the"
No," usually in cleaning products , and a lot of people keep their cleaning products under the sink . I do that too . It 'S probably not the best place to keep it . If you have kids because they can reach those products and a lot of them are pretty toxic , I actually had a friend"
No, when I was in Middle School . She came back from her soccer class . She found a water bottle on the table . She thought it was water and she drank it and her mom had actually kept bleach in that water bag . So she was in the hospital for a week because you know she eats pretty
No," regular rubbing , alcohol or gloves so that you 're not absorbing it onto your skin . But that 's a safer way to do it and you can actually use vinegar too and then there 's something called triclosan which is used in dish , washing detergents and soaps . Alternative"
No," actually writing the color of the dye and then they get caught by whoever you know them . Whoever regulates the food I 'm so in the us is the Food and Drug Administration . You know there 's different different departments , so then they change the name or they just put a"
No," So that 's something to look . Look for and a lot of these have been banned in Europe because they cause a lot of problems of behavior because cancer and they actually affect your genes too . So a lot of you , probably I 've , heard that problems in children like"
Environment," actually has a lot of negative effects that can happen that can occur . So it 's safety is not proven and actually reverse research has started to connect it with a lot of health problems and even damaging the environment , because it produces weeds that ca n't be killed"
Environment," cheaper , organic or you know just for those types of the ones on that list . Okay , so just really I wanted to go over the external environment . So how many of you have heard of global warming ? Yeah , it 's actually a misnomer"
Environment," , so environmental help and environmentalists actually call it climate change . They do n't call it global warming , because the warming part is just one aspect of it . So I just wanted to touch over this because it gives us the big picture , and I think I did n't really"
Environment," think about this as deeply as I would have . If I had not taken you know a few courses on environmental . So basically , what it is is if climate change is something that 's happening pretty much all over the world , it results from both natural processes and human processes . So"
Environment," there is a kind of natural waste that goes on so some , for example , plants give off certain gases . Volcanoes give off certain gases and that 's taken care of by the cycle in the environment , but the issue , especially over the last two three hundred years or so , is that we are"
Environment," contributing to the environment in a very negative way , especially because of industrialization industries . Are we use coal ? We use oil , we use natural gas and those produce a lot of waste . So that 's part of the reason for this . I do n't want to go into too"
No," carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen and get rid of it are not doing That anymore , so that 's one thing and then the second thing is like I talked about where we use a lot of coal and oil . Those are the main things we use for energy and those the byproducts of that are"
Environment," that 's a little concerning and then it 's also related to air air pollution , because the climate changing that that hot air actually makes air pollution worse because it 's just sits there . It does n't get rid of the pollution that we 're we 're producing and then it 's"
No," trapped in . So if you probably notice a lot of people in their families , they now have allergies , and I some of you know : kids , whose parents never had asthma . Now they have asthma , or do you have allergies and their parents like well , we never had that in our family . What you"
Environment," know what 's going on so this is part of the reason , because all of these all of this pollution is trapping that has nowhere to go so it goes into our bodies alright . So why is the problem and I 'll try to go through this really quickly ? Wallace"
Environment," to talk about , but these higher temperatures they result in climate variability . So it 's a little counterintuitive , but in some parts of the world things are getting hotter and in some parts of the world things are getting colder . So , that 's why it 's a"
Environment," change in temperature . It can really affect the fish populations , so why is it happening ? I talked a little bit about this . It 'S because of the fossil fuels that we 're using oil or oil and gas , and then this family 's environment . We need to be shifting more to clean energy , and"
Environment," and planting trees . This reduces air pollution and it actually counteracts that greenhouse effect that we were talking about , so it it those . We really need those trees to get rid of a lot of this waste and proper pleasant said that if I Muslim planted tree or south"
Environment," amount of waste that you 're producing by using your car and then you 're getting exercise too . If you can afford it and you 're in the market to buy a car , try to go for the hybrid or elect our electric cars . Those are kind of the they 're expensive , but they make up for it in the"
No, long run and they 're they 're much more cleaner forms of energy try to use solar energies if you can again it 's expensive . That 'S the problem with a lot of this is that the alternatives that we have are all expensive and that 's because we need to change that shift that demand .
No," and disasters , and things like that that are a byproduct of this whole cycle , so think about what we 're . Leaving behind and how this is going to affect our future , so in a few generations , what 's going to happen to to our children so just to end and emotions were to lose"
No," on having physical health and being engaged in in physical activities . Then we have to have mental wellbeing , which includes psychological and emotional wellbeing . Social wellbeing , which would include life , satisfaction and the fact that we participated in engaging , engage"
No," in activities and work will be in . So we have to have some economic wellbeing and we have to be satisfied at work we have to develop . Then we have to engage with with our work . On the other hand , we have here some costs associated with employees , mental health problems which"
Environment," are quite significant for businesses according to the National Institute for Health and Care , excellent excellent . These costs are associated with low productivity because of sickness , early retirements , increased staff , turnover recruitment and training , but also"
No," productivity can be reduced through presentation , which is when we go to work . But we have a lower level of performance because we 're stressed or experiencing mental health problems , and if we identify these costs early , we could be saving approximately 30 % . Well . The next"
Environment," easily measured and if we exclude the quality of water , which obviously is very important for our wellbeing , the main five components that a building that indoor environmental quality has would be noise light . Odors thermal comfort and indoor air quality , so , let 's start with"
Environment," noise . My colleague , Rebecca Hawke , who is our acoustical expert , will give a detailed presentation on sound next week , but very briefly , sound is any pressure variation that the human ear can detect and noise is any sound . That is unwanted . So obviously , if we were exposed to high"
Environment," levels of noise at work , we could face hearing loss , multitask multitasking becomes more difficult , we get stressed and our motivation will planets and the World Health Organization has reported the cost of hearing loss in Europe at approximately 30 billion Pounds , but when"
Environment," we are in an office environment , it is very unlikely that we were going to be exposed to really high levels of noise . So what matters in an office environment is the fact that our conversations and our speech can be heard . So we can become up to 66 % , less productive jessica 's"
Environment," contributes to the background noise ? Well , the next item on indoor environmental quality is light . When we measure light , we measure legs , which is the luminous luminous flux for a surface area , and we do not always need the same amount of light . It really depends on tasks that we"
No," migraines , headaches or irritability , and all of these will lead to poorer concentration . So it 's important to have the right levels , the right black lux levels in face , but other factors are also important for our wellbeing , such as"
No," sleep and for the following day . The next component that I 'm going to talk about is others and others are very closely linked to indoor air quality , and there is a way of measuring orders . So professor Olaf Unger from the University of Denmark , actually has worked a lot on"
Environment," environment . Others are related to indoor air quality , and the body to deal with others is to do a proper other investigation if necessary , but it 's also to have a right ventilation as ventilation dilutes contaminants , you need to have the right levels of"
Environment," indoor environmental quality component is thermal comfort , so thermal comfort is defined as that condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment . There are several standards to measure thermal comfort based also on the work from professor role of hunger"
No," , for example , asteroid 55 or BS en iso 773 0 . I saw 77026 refers to the instrumentation needed for measuring , so thermal comfort is a little bit more than measuring the temperature and relative humidity . You also have to have"
Environment," predicted mean vote and the predicted percentage of the satisfied draft risk is the risk of a person filling a draft and well . The predicted mean vote is , if I asked everybody in in a room to vote , how they feel with the with the environment and and to let me know , on a scale from"
Environment," minus 3 to plus 3 how they feel with the environment with verse . Zero would be . I feel quite comfortable in this environment . One would be , I feel slightly warm to . I feel quite warm three I feel extremely hot in this environment and then minus 1 minus 2 , minus 3 would be , I"
Environment," feel , slightly cold , quite cold , extremely cold in this environment . So if we put all those votes together , we would have a they mean vote . The advantage of these calculations is that they can be done before a building is built so , for example , in a mockup environment - and you"
Environment," satisfied or PPP . Ppp is related to to the PMD . So , as you can see here in an environment that is extremely hot or in an environment that is extremely cold , 100 percent of the people would feel dissatisfied with you with the environment , and"
Environment," percentage of is satisfied . M goes down as the PM V approaches zero , but if you see here , the PPD is never zero . There is always approximately 6 % of people who would vote that they feel uncomfortable with a with the environment , even even in the perfect environment . And finally , the"
No," last component of indoor environmental quality is indoor air quality , so good indoor air quality is defined as with no known contaminants at harmful concentrations . So this means that the air that we breathe is not contaminant free , but we have to make it so that the"
Environment," level of contaminant is not harmful to our health to have good indoor air quality . What we need is a few things . We need low external pollution concentrations or filtering in the in the ventilation system , because the air from outside is coming through the"
No," undelete the contaminant concentration . The five main contaminants that affect air quality can be classified in particles , gaseous others again , as I mentioned , that they were very closely related to air quality , volatile organic compounds and"
Environment," wellbeing is made up of four elements which includes social , mental , physical and work wellbeing . We have seen how buildings can affect our wellbeing and that the five main components of indoor environmental quality are indoor air quality , odors , noise , light and thermal"
Environment," three webinars on indoor air quality , thermal comfort and sound in the built environment , which are also free to attend . That 'S the end of the presentation . Thank you very much for attending and if you have any questions I 'll be very happy to answer them . Thank"
No, What are we doing here and where are we going to go It's like we just woke up one morning and then it's welcome to the show Don't ask any questions just go with the flow Make as much money as you can and try your best not to get broke Copy everything you see on the tv From the hairstyles to the clothes And don't think too often just do exactly as your told You ever get confused then turn towards the alcohol You still hear your thoughts?
No," then just turn up the radio As you learn to live a lifestyle of drugs, sex and rock n roll But in all honesty I just need to know Is there more to the cycle than growing and getting old Living and dying just to leave behind a happy home And a whole lot of property that somebody else is going to own I just really need to know before the caskets closed"
No," To a man who couldn't read or write, as he would recite what the angel spoke. And if you still don't believe please come up with something that's even close. But you can't. So we took God as a mockery and his Messengers as a joke Dismissed his scriptures as legends and tales of the ancient folk. As we live life according to our whims, desires and hopes Saying this life is the only home we will ever know"
No," But you were busy chasing all that which was temporary So read, and glad tidings to all those who believed, but if you disbelieve READ And don't let that day be the first day you find out what life really means. READ"
No," Hey everyone. Happy Thursday. Now today I'm going to just answer a question. I was gonna do coffee and a chat, but it is later in the day and I don't know if you are like me, but I can't drink coffee that late, 'cause then I can't sleep. It gives me the jitters. So today's question is actually something that I'm surprised I haven't talked about before, so we're gonna talk about it."
No," And the question is ""Hey Kati. Can mental illness/illnesses physically affect you?"" Good question. ""I don't mean behavior. I mean physical illness and pain. More specifically, I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. I wake up almost every morning feeling physically ill. (sick heavy head)"" they say in parentheses ""but more than that, it's really hard to compare it to any other feeling."
No," I'm pretty sure it's not an anxious stomach, but it's only when I wake up, even when I've had a really good night sleep. I stay off of school because of it and it's hard to explain it to my dad so I just refuse to go."" And the truth of it is that this is very very common. Yes, it is completely normal to physically feel what's going on with us mentally. And I'm sure you've heard people talk about how powerful the human mind is, and how powerful it can be."
No," Those are very common, and that is why we usually end up, if we've never been diagnosed, we haven't gotten treatment, a lot of people end up in their GP or regular doctor or primary care doctor's office first. Because we don't feel well. We think we're sick, but we don't have like green snot or other things that tell us we're sick or a fever. But we just don't feel well and it keeps going on and persisting"
No," If we are feeling really down and out, that body aches might be common. We might wanna sleep a lot. A lot of symptoms that we could think of and associate with illness. So get checked out by your doctor first because we all know it could be sickness, but if it's been going on and you've gotten checked out and everything is fine. Ask them for a referral to see a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, someone, some mental health professional, so that you can get properly diagnosed"
No," and get the help that you want. And if you have not hopped over to the Shorty awards. I'm gonna put the link in the description. Mental health is finally being recognized, and we as a community are finally on the board! And so you can vote once a day, each day. Once a day until February 18th. And if you put it on your Twitter or Facebook, we get an extra point like another vote that counts twice. So exciting!"
No, So if you could share the link. Share it on your Twitter or Facebook. We could really rally the masses and mental health could get an award. That's so exciting. I used to like beg and plead to try to get us involved in this stuff and I never heard from anybody. And now we're on it so please vote if you haven't. Link in the description. Also I wanna give a wholehearted thank you to all of my patreon patrons. I usually put their names at the end of a Monday video but I had a collab this Monday
No," so everything was off so thank you so much. Here are the people who give and if you are interested in helping the kinion community helping us reach more people and supporting this channel, I'll put the link in the description for that as well. I love you all and I will see you on Monday. Bye! I think that's about the only dance I know. Subtitles by the Amara.org community"
No," In this video , i 'm going to share with you how to overcome every physical symptom caused by anxiety . Now chances are , if you 're struggling with anxiety , you 're getting very intense physical symptoms and what i 'm about to show you is actually transferable . So , if you 're"
No," really dealing with intrusive thoughts , if you 're getting feelings of unreality , what i 'm showing you right now , you can apply the same principles to those things too . Chances are if you 're struggling with anxiety and you 're getting physical"
No," symptoms , you 're , probably also experiencing really weird emotions . Intrusive thoughts , feelings of unreality like depersonalization derealization , i 'm gon na really break it down step by step . This is gon na , be a guide to show you how to overcome all the physical symptoms ."
No," Okay . So , let 's get now if you 're struggling with anxiety , you may have came across a couple of terms like hypochondriac or hypochondriasis , and to be honest with you , that term is n't really used anymore and it 's not really a term i 'm a fan of"
No," , because the term hypochondriac can Make it seem like it 's an identity right and with anxiety ? It 'S not an identity . Now you may be hearing the terms called health anxiety . I also do n't think that really applies and works very well , because that assumes that you 're scared"
No," of your health , but really what you 're doing is you 're responding to physical symptoms . If you 're really struggling with anxiety , you know what i mean you 're , getting physical symptoms , that 's making you question your health , that 's different"
No," than just being concerned about your health you 're , actually feeling physical symptoms . That indicates that there could be something wrong with your health . Now i want you to take a look at somebody who struggles with health , anxiety or physical symptoms and really"
No," say : hey , there 's , nothing there , it 's just anxiety and you 're thinking . Wait . Anxiety is just my head because i 'm i 'm responding to something physical and you may even go to another doctor after that , and the doctor says no you 're"
No," your symptoms go away . Your symptoms could be anything digestive issues , dizziness nausea , vertigo . Any symptom possible literally , it can cause a million different symptoms and so you 're doing all this and you 're"
No," forms different things , they 'll say things like ? Oh no , it 's not anxiety . Actually , it 's something else and now you 're convinced that you have something else . Maybe that thing is somebody says : oh no , it 's not anxiety , those things are like lupus"
No," , google searching and now you 're really spiraling . Now you ca n't stop thinking about this now . You'Re constantly focusing on the symptom you 're wondering : has it increased more ? Has it decreased ? Wait it increased more when this happened . Maybe"
No," going to have this for the rest of your life right . Well , i want to share with you how to overcome this once and for all , because it 's actually very simple now the first step is identifying . If it 's anxiety or not are , is what you 're experiencing truly"
No," anxiety , or is it not a lot of people get stuck here , because these symptoms are just too bizarre to be anxiety , they 're just too profound and they 're just too too intense to just be something where there 's Nothing some there 's nothing physically wrong"
No," that their symptoms are n't anxiety or their symptoms actually are anxiety and it 's not caused by something else , and they get so irritated and frustrated and think about it . From the doctor 's standpoint , because the doctor who sometimes does have to give bad news is"
No," if your doctors ruled everything out that it 's definitely anxiety now before i get into stage two and really explain what 's the next step , is you really have to come at this video in a certain frame of mind And that"
No," easily think that that 's the onset of a Heart attack now that may be the case in the past , or people you 've known , but you 've gotten everything ruled out now . Just because you get palpitations does n't mean it 's an onset of a heart attack , it could be anxiety . That 'S why"
No," it 's so important step . One is to get everything ruled out and believe it now , when you understand the fight or flight response , that will give you a much better idea of how anxiety works on a nervous system level . Now you may be wondering okay , i understand the"
No, understanding the term sensitization nervous system sensitization . Now here 's how this works and one of the pioneers of this was a uh physician by the name of dr claire week . She writes this book hope and help for your nerves . It 'S a great book . I really
No," intrusive thoughts when you get overwhelmed enough . You'Ll experience , depersonalization derealization , so anxiety is really at the core of it . Sensitization , your nervous system becoming very sensitive . It 'S very"
No," overwhelmed and the side effects That you 're experiencing are these physical symptoms . Now , once you understand the fight or flight response , once you 've gotten everything ruled out once you understand sensitization now , what do you do ?"
No," Well , if you understand the fact that all these symptoms , every single one , even the most bizarre symptoms , are part of anxiety and it 's caused by your nervous system being overwhelmed . You can understand the fact that for once , you do n't have to do anything about"
No," this , because you may be thinking okay . How do i desensitize ? What do i do to desensitize ? The truth is : is that you do n't do anything to desensitize ? Desensitization happens as a consequence . Think about it this way"
No," you may be thinking okay , but what am i doing ? What am i doing right now ? That 'S causing my nervous system to be sensitized . Well , there 's really five different things . You can be doing . Okay and i want to break it down - it 's called the five f 's , it 's um , a term that uh one"
No," happen if you fear it , if you fear it you 're going to try to do everything to resist it . So you 're trying to fight the symptoms , you 're not trying to feel it you 're not trying to let it be there you 're trying to make it a small part of your daily living and then what happens"
No," Problem , if you focus on it well , you can fix the problem right . If you can see what the problem is . Well then focus on it see what 's wrong and you can fix it , but what happens with anxiety is that it works a little differently . The more you focus on it , the more it grows . That 'S how"
No," different and a lot of it is based on what they focus on . So whatever you focus on actually grows . So when you 're struggling with these physical symptoms , you are doing one of these five things . Now you may not realize you 're doing one of these five things , but you are , and so"
No," grasping that concept , think about it . The reverse : well , if you 're , not accepting , then what are you doing you 're doing one of those five apps like i mentioned , so i hope this video helps . If you can focus on this"
No," can start doing one of these five fs or you can separate your anxiety symptoms into like five or six different problems . So what i would recommend is understand how anxiety works , learn , how to respond and"
No," have a guide to guide you through each step of the way , and so this is how you fully overcome health anxiety . This is exactly how i did it . This is how exactly hundreds thousands of people that i know like have recovered to so i hope this video helps and i 'll see you in the next"
No," Would you like to hear something surprising , but true learning about the various health behavior theories may be one of the most useful and exciting things you will learn in this course , though theories may seem a little bit dry at first , and I totally get that"
No," in public health . Nutrition be able to justify why using an appropriate health , behavior theory or perhaps more than one is essential to good program planning and be able to explain the health belief model , one of the earliest health behavior theories . First , what is a theory ?"
No," promote health more likely to succeed . Let 'S take a look at one of the earliest theories of health behavior , the health belief model . This model has a lot of Appeal because it 's logical , simple and it provides very useful insights into behavior and"
No," behavior change . There are four key constructs in the health belief model , perceived susceptibility , perceived severity , perceived benefits and perceived barriers . Note the recurrence of the word perceived according to the health belief model"
No, context of an overall healthy diet would promote bone health and reduce your chance of developing osteoporosis . How beneficial do you think those actions would be both in terms of effectively preventing osteoporosis and with respect to the other benefits of those behaviors
Environment," perceived barriers refers to your opinion of the costs or drawbacks of the advised action . Perhaps you do n't like exercise , for example , or you find it really hard to fit it into your day . Maybe you do n't like dairy products or swallowing supplement pills or you do n't"
No," think you can afford supplements or sufficient healthy food . These would all be barriers to your undertaking . The recommended action , the health belief model , notes that all these perceptions are affected by modifying factors . Things such as age , ethnicity , socioeconomic"
No," This points to one goal for health promotion programs based upon the health belief model , creating realistic perceptions of threat in the target population . Strategies for increasing perceived threat could include educational materials to increase"
No," perceived severity or fear appeals to increase , perceived susceptibility , our evaluations of perceived benefits and perceived barriers combined to determine our response on some level . We evaluate the pros and cons and determine whether there would be a net gain associated"
No, strategies to minimize the barriers people may experience . There are two other important components of the health belief model cues to action and selfefficacy cues to action serve as a trigger for behavior . Seeing a media campaign might serve as a cue to action .
No, been incorporated into many health behavior theories because of the clear evidence of its importance in determining behavior . Selfefficacy refers to the belief that can successfully undertake a particular behavior and persist with that behavior
No, in the face of challenges . The belief that you can perform a task or take an action at a particular level of competence is important in both initiating and maintaining behavior change . You know that theories explain and predict . Let 'S look at a couple of
No," examples of how the health belief model has been used in this regard . In a study of 75 American women between the ages of 18 and 45 , who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes during their last pregnancy , participants completed a survey examining their perceptions of"
Environment," education regarding risk for type 2 diabetes , something that could be filled with a nutrition education initiative . Current dietary quality in this sample of women was moderate , not awful , but not great either . Interestingly , the researchers found that the only"
Environment, variables which were significant predictors of a healthier eating pattern were higher levels of selfefficacy for healthy eating and higher education . The importance of selfefficacy for healthy eating in predicting healthy eating underscores the significance of
Environment," selfefficacy and also highlight something that health promotion initiatives could aim to effect . Dietary selfefficacy can be increased through strategies such as education , problemsolving , observational learning and so on . So increasing selfefficacy"
No, health belief model were applied to develop an intervention which aimed to increase the frequency of tooth brushing among unemployed adults between 18 and 24 years old living in New Zealand . The keep on rushing project sent motivational text messages created
No, according to the constructs of the health belief model to participants once per week for a 10 week time period . These messages highlighted some of the benefits of tooth brushing ones susceptibility to tooth decay or the severity of cavities of 171 people who
No," participating in the study and answered the question about how many times they brush their teeth . On the previous day , the researchers conducting this trial concluded that motivational text messages based upon the health belief model , constructs increased tooth"
No, key health behavior theories used in public health . Consider these questions . What are the main strengths and limitations of each model ? How are the models similar to and different from each other ? How have the models been used to develop
No," , most likely a result of a heart attack . The ambulance crew had started resuscitation at the scene and we continued delivering drugs manual compressions exactly how we 'd all been trained ."
No," , not struggle in vain and succumb to losing patience , and when i went home that night , i refreshed my memory on how many heart attacks there are in the uk every year it was slightly less than but now it 's over a hundred thousand"
No," country my name is rupee . I 'M a nhs doctor and the medicine i 'm prescribing today is food , but as more people understand the power of our diets to help prevent and in some"
No," different approach , because it seems strange to me that you can have some people who decide to eat a plantbased diet and improve their heart disease , markers others . Who choose paleo and improve their bowel symptoms"
No," , while some swear by low carbohydrate and come off diabetes medications if these diets are so wildly different , how can they achieve such similar and , frankly , remarkable outcomes and the reason ? Why is because a lot of the underlying"
No," principles are the same : let 's take a visual approach , so i 've taken the liberty of excluding diets that restrict yourself to just eating cucumbers or just pure meat , luckily they 're , not that popular and they lack an evidence base . But when we"
No," look at popular diets that have credible studies , paleo low carbohydrate mediterranean dash whole food plantbased and we map out where the similarities lie , you will notice an abundance of overlapping"
Environment," themes and it 's this exercise that reveals the principles behind a lot of them . Naturally , as you would imagine , all of them remove excess junk food processed foods , excess sugar , as well as balancing for energy control . I think we can all"
No," very core of our existence . Our dna and alongside other lifestyle factors like stress and sleep food , has the potential to switch genes on and others off . This is the exciting field of nutrigenetics , the power of your food , to change the expression of your genes to"
No," promote health , and we know for the majority of us . It is a diet that consists largely of plants and lots of colors . Many bodies , including the world health organization , recognize that eating a prudent diet ."
No," Consistent with these features lowers the risk of chronic kidney disease , autoimmune conditions , inflammatory bowel disease , cancer , depression and many more beyond just obesity and disease . Your plate contains a wealth of information that"
No, actually adversarial and complementary . In many ways i want to make it clear here that food is not a panacea : it 's not a cure or a replacement for the many drugs and
No," and expect you to just do it in the same way , i can prescribe a pill to a patient and ask them to take it three times a day , but it 's not . I remember around seven years ago , when i started introducing diet into my"
No, consultations . I had a 45 year old man come into my clinic . His blood work showed that he was on the verge of type 2 diabetes and we had a conversation about how diet and lifestyle can prevent the progression to type two . He was n't keen on changing much about
No," his diet . That was full of convenience foods , but i said , look let 's just start slow , let 's just start with one meal and he said well . I have frosted wheaties for breakfast . I do n't really like that . Maybe that i said great , do you like oats ? He said i do n't mind . Porridge , fantastic"
No," taught about the importance of food . At medical school , our children are not educated in how to grow or cook as part of their schooling , which is why i have patients that ca n't make the simplest of dishes like oats"
Environment," and access to healthy foods depends on where you live . The promotion of unhealthy options target the most vulnerable and , whilst i ca n't pretend to help with every aspect of this complicated food environment"
No," , i can provide you with some insight into some hope . There is a movement starting in the uk , and it is starting right here in bristol , because your local medical school is one of the first in the country to start teaching future doctors , not only the"
Environment," foundations of nutrition , but also how to cook . In 2018 , i brought together a group of nutrition experts and doctors , passionate about reforming nutrition , education and uk medical schools . We ran the uk 's first , culinary medicine course , an intense"
Environment," method took students through the impact of nutrition , on mental health , on our guts on our environment and beyond . We ran the cooking courses in an nhs gp surgery right here in bristol , with its own fit for purpose . Community kitchen , we even had students run their own"
No," health promotion clinics going to families , homes and helping them stock , their cupboards with nutritious affordable ingredients and arranged by one of your incredible local gps . We even had medical students cooking for the homeless"
No, lifestylerelated illnesses that threaten to completely expend all nhs resources unless we get to the root cause of what is causing illness in the first place and many diet . Many many studies point toward diet
Environment," make that the norm here in the uk as more medical schools , wake up to the need for nutrition training in medicine . But if we are serious about building the healthiest population possible where chronic disease is a rarity type , 2"
Environment," environment , making food as medicine , not acute or quirky concept , but the norm elevating nutritional medicine into a recognizable mainstream concept . In the pursuit of a proactive , healthier population , affiliating all gp surgeries"
Environment," up and down the country with community kitchens and investing far much more research into nutrition , i 've talked a bit about how food can prevent disease . I'Ve talked to you a bit about how complicated this food environment is and"
No," squash mash ? It 'S these collections of small additions to what our diets lack every day every week , every year that have the potential for much larger , downstream effects . The opportunity"
No," of having the biggest impact on your health is actually in your hands . It 'S not with a blockbuster drug . It 'S not with a new pioneering surgical technique ; it is with the simplest solution , is how we feed ourselves"
No, and i 'm hopeful . We can generate a foodfocused approach to health in our communities instead of reacting to disease in our emergency departments . Thank you . You
No," Translator: Mayumi OiwaBungard Reviewer: Queenie Lee In 1847, a physician by the name of Semmelweis advised that all physicians wash their hands before touching a pregnant woman, in order to prevent childbed fever. His research showed that you could reduce the mortality rates from septicemia,"
No," Nutrition matters. Poor nutrition is a significant and modifiable risk factor for the development of mental illness. According to the 2013 New Zealand Health Survey, the rates of psychiatric illnesses in children doubled over the last five years. Internationally, there's been a 3fold increase in ADHD,"
No," a 20fold increase in autism, and a 40fold increase in bipolar disorder in children. And this graph here shows there's been a 4fold increase in the number of people who are on disability as a direct consequence of an underlying psychiatric illness. The rates of mental illness are on the rise. So how are we dealing with this problem?"
No," Currently, our healthcare system operates within a medical model. Now, this means that you would typically be offered psychiatric medications first, followed by psychological therapies, and other forms of support. Our reliance on medications as a frontline form of treatment is evident from the increasing rates of prescriptions. For example in 2012,"
No," you would rightfully expect that it was working well. And indeed, in some cases, these treatments save lives. And I'm not here to dismiss it altogether. However, if a treatment is truly effective, then shouldn't the rates of disorder and disability as a direct consequence of that illness be decreasing rather than increasing?"
No," That's why we need to consider the role that medications might be playing in some of these outcomes. If we take any class of medication: antipsychotics, antianxiety medications, antidepressants; the pattern is the same. In the shortterm, these treatments are often very effective, but in the longterm, they aren't."
No," And in some cases, they're making life worse. If we look at, for example, studies that are being done on ADHD children treated with stimulants or Ritalin, in the shortterm, they are better, and responding better responders than any other form of treatment, but in the longterm,"
No," they fare less well than children who were never prescribed these medications. Another study showed that despite our everincreasing reliance on antidepressants, the recovery rates and relapse rates are no better now than they were 50 years ago, prior to the advent of these medications."
No, And children with depression who were treated with antidepressants are three times more likely to convert to bipolar disorder than children who were never given these medications. And people who were randomized to stay on their dose of antipsychotic medications are less likely to recover from schizophrenia in the longterm
No," than people who had been randomized to a dose reduction or complete elimination of the drug. And I can show you more and more studies all highlighting the same bleak picture. So, pretty depressing. Is there another way forward?"
Environment," Almost two decades ago, my PhD supervisor at the time, Professor Bonnie Kaplan, told me about some families who were treating themselves with nutrients, in Southern Alberta, Canada. Now, they had bipolar disorder, psychosis, depression. These are serious conditions, and my education in clinical psychology"
No," had taught me that nutrition and diet were of trivial significance for mental health, and that only drugs or psychotherapy could treat these serious conditions. But she and others were publishing preliminary data in the earlier part of this century, showing people getting well and staying well. And so, I decided to study the nutrients, and that's what I've done for the last decade."
No," In 2009, I received some funding to run a randomized placebocontrolled trial, using minerals and vitamins, also known collectively as micronutrients, for the treatment of ADHD in adults. And this study was published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in April of this year, and here's what we found. Within just an 8week period,"
No," twice as many people responded in the micronutrient group compared to placebo; twice as many people went into remission in their depression, in the micronutrient group. Hyperactivity and impulsivity reduced into the normal, nonclinical range, and those who were taking the micronutrients were more likely to report"
No," So it would be unlikely that if you went and got an overthecounter supplement, you would unlikely see these positive benefits, both because the dose is lower, and the breadth of nutrients is lower. Now, these positive benefits are not confined to a single study. My lab at the University of Canterbury is the Mental Health and Nutrition Research Group,"
No," and we've published over 20 papers in medical journals, all documenting the benefits of micronutrients. For example, this study here showed that we could reduce the symptoms of bipolar disorder in children by 50% with a simultaneous reduction of medications. This study here showed that we could reduce rates of probable posttraumatic stress disorder"
No," to improve the mental health of a population following an environmental catastrophe. In my 20year career, I have rarely seen these dramatic responses from conventional treatments. When people get well, they get well across the board, not only in the symptoms that we treated,"
No," but also in other areas, like improved sleep, stabilization of mood, reduction in anxiety, and the reduction in need for cigarettes, cannabis, and alcohol. My research and those around the world have shown that 60 80% of people respond to micronutrients, showing just how powerful this intervention is. And internationally,"
No," there have now been 20 randomized placebocontrolled trials this is the gold standard that we use to make clinical decisions showing that we can reduce aggression in prisoners, slow cognitive decline in the elderly, treat depression, anxiety, stress, autism, and ADHD. And, they might even be more costeffective than current conventional treatments."
No," This study here documented the treatment of a 10yearold boy with psychosis. When his 6month inpatient treatment with medications was unsuccessful, he was treated with micronutrients. Not only did the micronutrients completely eliminate his hallucinations and delusions changes that were maintained six years later but the cost of the treatment was less than 2%"
No, than the cost of the unsuccessful inpatient treatment. The cost savings alone make it imperative that our society pay attention to the wider benefits of this approach. And there is more good news. Treating Supplementing before mental illness emerges can actually stop these problems from developing in the first place.
No," versus 28% of those on placebo. That represents an 80% reduction of the chances of you converting to psychosis, simply through giving fish oils. I wonder if I know what some of you are thinking. I wonder if some of you are thinking, ""Hold on! Why don't I just eat better?"""
No," ""Why don't I just tell everyone to eat better?"" And indeed, there are some fantastic studies that document the strong relationship between dietary patterns and mental health although we're still in very early days of scientific investigation. We don't know who would benefit from dietary manipulation alone, and who may need the additional boost from extra nutrients. But even in the last five years,"
No," there have been 11 epidemiological studies, crosssectionally and longitudinally, in large populations around the world, all showing the same thing. The more you eat a prudent or Mediterranean or unprocessed type of diet, the lower your risk for depression."
No," And the more you eat the Western diet or processed food, the higher your risk for depression. I know of only one study that has not found this association, and not a single study shows that the Western diet is good for our mental health. What is the Western diet? Well, it's one that is heavily processed,"
No," high in refined grains, sugary drinks, takeaways, and low in fresh produce. And the healthy diet is one that is fresh, high in fruits and vegetables, high in fish, nuts, healthy fats, and low in processed foods. What your grandmother would recognize as food."
No," There are still many questions remaining about the relationship between mental health and nutrition. What role do genetics play in determining who's going to respond to nutrients, and who needs additional nutrients than what they can get out of their diet? What role does an infected, inflamed gut play in the absorption of nutrients? It's not we are what we eat;"
Environment," this rich data highlighting the power of nutrition, I think we can make some individual and collective changes now. We could reconsider our current treatment approach: prioritize lifestyle factors, healthy eating, exercise, supplements, and when necessary, psychological treatments, and save medications for when these approaches don't work."
No, It should be no different with mental health. An easy way to implement universal prevention would be to have pregnant women not pregnant women: midwives tell pregnant women about the importance of nutrition. Nutrientdepleted mothers produce nutrientdepleted children. Nutrientpoor foods during pregnancy increase the chances that your child will have a mental health problem.
Environment," Learn about the risks of cheap, processed foods. As Michael Pollan stated, cheap food is an illusion; there is no such thing as cheap food. The price is paid somewhere, and if it's not paid at the cash register, then it's charged to the environment and to the public purse in the form of subsidies, and it's charged to your health."
No," All children need to learn how to cook. All children need to know that food doesn't have to come in a packet. Schools could reflect on the content of their lunch menus. Children are too frequently rewarded with processed foods for good behavior. We need to reflect on whether or not this pairing intuitively makes sense. Ultimately, we have a responsibility to teach them that every time they put something in their mouths,"
No, for some people with mental illness. But eating well and when appropriate additional nutrients can improve the mental health of many people. I leave you with one last thought. Randomized trials in the 1600s showed that putting limes aboard ships headed out for long voyages completely eliminated the 40% mortality from scurvy.
No," But it took 264 years for the British government to mandate that all ships must carry citrus for their sailors. How long will it take our society to pay attention to the research showing that suboptimal nutrition is contributing to the epidemic of mental illness? So this is my idea worth spreading: Nutrition matters, and if we're really ready to get serious about mental health,"
No," thinking up your dream , health , behaviors And what that looks so go into that , and just as an FYI , I 'm gon na be taking notes throughout , and these notes are just something that I have so . I can always go back when in between a question , so we can kind of keep track of things . They'Re"
Environment," to support your health and wellbeing yeah ? So with my background and exercise and just passion for that , I 've had for years just a habit of doing almost daily exercise , and so it 's nothing insane . But I always do about 25 30 minutes of something whether it be yoga weight"
No," , lifting going out for a very slow run , because I 'm not very fast or like some sort of dance , cardio type type , workout so consistently doing that I 'd also say consistently getting pretty good Sleep , like you know , seven to eight eight and a half hours a night yeah , and"
No," love the job that I get to do so wellness coaching and then getting to teach a class . I put Pepperdine as well , so I think careerwise I 'm super pleased and I feel grateful for that because I know that has n't always been the case for me and"
No," like that , and I 've just been really blessed . I'Ve moved around a lot and have been blessed with making really good friends in all those places . So , even though it 's hard to live far away from these good friends , I we still all try and keep up with each other , and so I 'm"
No," just really grateful for these . Like kind of powerhouse women that I get to be friends with , that sounds like a really nice life yeah . I love hearing that . That 'S really really great . Thank you . Do you want to highlight , maybe - and let 's specifically think about your health and"
No," just to be clear about health , we 're thinking about health in a very broad , very holistic fashion right , so sometimes what the fitness industry does is tell us that health is two things : nutrition and Physical activity already hearing you talk about things"
No," like your relationships and things like because it 's really bigger picture right , it 's person ! So thinking about that , can you tell me some success stories that you 've had recently with your health ? Oh , let 's see yeah . I feel like a success story in the sense , like kind of thinking"
Environment," about , like the fitness industry , how you 've mentioned a lot of the stories . At least I hear coming out of it . Are you have to go hard all the time with your your exercise , for it to counts , for it to matter , and I just feel like I 'm in like exercise has just become this like this"
No," is how I 'm able to meet the rest of life 's demands well , and So I think a success story is just kind of over those years of X , sighs just coming to a place of like , even if I do n't have a specific goal , I 'm pursuing just the fact that I 'm doing it"
No," strengths that you um and I know you 've - probably all done some strength . Finders test they 'll tell you that , but just innately and thinking about who you are think what qualities are you just the most proud of about yourself ? Hmm , that 's a good question . I think meeting a lot of"
No," I think just caring a lot about people is a strength . I 'M proud of just wanting the best for them wanting to be a part of them , reaching that , whether it 's like family or coaching clients or students , like or friends , you know it 's just . I love like being witness to them"
No," and having a need to wanting to help okay . So the strengths , I 'm hearing from you so far kind of this , this innate positive , joyful attitude that that you know you might naturally have , but also you kind of fox or not yourself , right and that 's kind of helped get through"
No," some things and which is really a Great you know . Naturally , they have have this wanting to help people and that being , it seems like a common thread throughout all of the avenues of your life right professional . Can you think of any other major strengths that you think even"
No," think about this ? Like think about what has gotten you through some things in the past , you know yeah , I would definitely say well , I guess I do n't know if it 's like a strength or not , but my faith for sure and they 're just like that belief that I 'm not alone and"
No," There 'S that higher bigger power that I can rely on , so that 's one and I think just I guess the part that I 've played in making connections with friends and family and so then again kind of knowing that when I hit hard times that I have those people , Whether they live next to"
No, so definitely so what right now thinking about your health and wellbeing ? What do you think is the most important thing to you right now today . I guess like important in like like for a future or for um . We can even do to say we could I see what you 're saying
No," meeting right now versus next week or yeah yeah ? How about we just think about it , for both right like it could be ? Like what 's currently the most important , but maybe what 's on your brain for the future , yeah yeah , so I think currently something I 've been thinking about me in"
Environment," the exercise is going well . But the nutrition piece is another story , and so I kind of want to end up with that similar kind of like good relationship with the food , as I have with that exercise . So I want that to be a little more balanced , okay . So to do that"
Environment," currently and then more future , I think one of the reasons that exercise is so beneficial is that , like I have scoliosis , and so I I 'm just very aware that now that I 'm in my midthirties our bodies , do you kind of grow , older and Degenerate and I want to be active as long as"
Environment," possible , so I just do n't I want to . I do n't want to be limited by that , so I want to keep doing that exercise as much as possible so that I can slow that decline and then , if you 're going to take that same perspective of of age with nutrition . How do you feel about"
No," wanting to have that , so it also kind of ties to the future of wanting to do that . But I think also presently I notice how much it affects my energy , which of course like then affects how good of a job I can do how well I can connect with people it 's all connected . So so , let 's"
No," like that motivator , it 's just nutrition , but it also sound like you 're , not as um satisfied , maybe with where you are on your relationship with with nutritions . Can you speak a little bit more to that yeah , so I think I again have been blessed to feel like I had n't had like a"
No," poor relationship with food , or things like that and and very much a an intuitive eater anyway . But I also am a big celebrator . I love I mean this could be like where the strengths kind of goes wrong , like the joyfulness can also be like"
No," would have done something different mmm , yeah yeah . I think that 's great question . Um yeah . I think , even just like , within the past couple of weeks , like um , treating dinner time where my husband and his brother lives with us now and so like , where all three of us are at"
No," home , which actually happens every night for dÃ¼ndar , I 'm thinking like oh , I Should make cookies for us , and I should also make sure that we 've got some . You know spiced wine , because it 's the Christmas season and so doing that , where maybe one of those things would have been fine or"
No," and I value celebration , so it 's kind of like this is what I contribute to our little family , and I also know my husband 's been working so hard that And this is n't anything he 's asked for , but it 's always think I 'm like . Oh , let me make it take a"
No," to this piece of seeing your husband and in maybe a stressful time of year , and wanting to help him out right and you 're , using your words , taking a load off right . By doing this is there any other reason ? You think that you think you 've been doing this recently , so I know it 's a way"
No," to contribute , maybe helping your your husband and your little family there , but any other reasons yeah . I think honestly , again , cuz I 'm in a season of being in so much alone time . I think it 's like something to do so like making cookies or making this um these fun holiday"
No," , and I think it becomes more pressing when it 's I 'm about to go after certification and I 'm currently seeing some clients . And I learned from the clients too , when they 're pursuing goals and it kind of inspires me to do stuff . To always learning yeah , okay"
Environment," now , what is it ? What does it look like ? Take me a picture . What does it feel like ? What are you doing ? You know yeah . I think the exercise is similar like neardaily , something that just feels good in my body . I think that a majority of the time I 'm eating foods"
No," of fuel , my body for energy , with you , know the the minority of the time . Having those celebrating foods and having like a better balance of that mmhmm , I think because of that then I would just feel really really energized . My skin would be clear . I would feel strong"
No," and able to be really present , whoever I 'm talking with whether it be a coaching client or a student or threader family you 'd be more present because of what you said earlier right of having more energy right . Okay , and not like that kind of brain fog that can come with"
No," certain foods and drinks and stuff , so you feel that connection between the food and your energy levels - and I call that definitely so one question I have is - is this something that you you typically Experience because you use the word seasonal - is this something : it is"
No," truly a seasonal feeling , meaning this time of the holiday season relatively new thing for this particular season of your life . That 'S a great question and that I 'm glad you asked because if you think of yes , so it has n't just been this particular holiday season . It 'S been like"
No," , really energy , energized and you 're , not having that fog . Can you tell me maybe some of your recent experiences or most recent experiences of feeling that way with food yeah , I think one was when I was at Colorado , State and crazy enough leading adult fitness and which is"
No," , because I know I did it some , but not not a ton . Maybe you know I definitely had like my fill of people like it was the nature of that job . My husband I were dating about to get engaged and married . So we have spent a lot of time together and still had a lot of my grad school"
No," friends in town . So I think I was just like really full in that way . If that makes sense , yeah , I think that 's a good tie right is noticing that not only was it maybe just literally not having the time to do it , but the tie to the fact that you 've"
No," a good question . I think , though , I have an awesome social network who does n't live here , I 'm still working on creating one here . Having that friend time , facetoface is kind of what I 'm missing out on I 'm getting it . It 'S like the slow turn of building those relationships , but"
No," it 's not to the place of like . Oh , these are best friends for life yeah . So then it feels like those moments you really have to make special yeah . I appreciate you sharing that too . It sounds like you have a thinking about that past experience really kind of maybe"
No," highlighted some of that yeah and I never thought about it that way . It 'S okay ! So now , let 's think about your strengths right , that 's why I always loved . If we 're think about your strengths , what strengths do you think you can draw on right now to help you"
No," diminish it yeah and it 's still very , very important . But what do you think what strikes you have can get you to that ? That point . I definitely think I do have a strength of connecting with people , and so I think that I can make those relationships here ."
No," I think it just takes um kind of reminding myself about hey you 've done this in the past . I'Ve moved a lot so recognizing that and even recognizing I had a friend tell me recently that who moves a lot that she has learned that each place is different , and so you ca n't"
No," go into it . Thinking like oh , it 's gon na , be exactly the same as this last place because as different people different things to do , you know . So I think recognizing to you that these are different . People is a different place , but I can still use my strengths of"
No," connecting to others and then I also from the food Avenue . I do n't know if it 's enough to say like that , will trickle down to the food sure thanks for that I mean I strength . Is that I , I know I 've kind of done the work to know what energizes my body , so I know what kinds"
No," down a little bit dig deeper and we 'll get there . It 'S great okay , so sounds like a strength of connecting people can can help . Just because you know you can do that and you 're kind of fostering some of those relationships right now and talking to"
No," other friends , who 've done it in the past and moved to learn a lot just , I think , maybe being being open and kind to yourself , and it Might take a bit longer , it might be different than in the past right and but then also stuff like that . Might"
No," questions you 're asking , but I think it feels slower to me that I want the descrition change to be good . You never know how long it 'll take to make like those really close friendships . Yes , what are you currently doing to build those ? So we have a church that we go to you"
No," and it 's nice and small one . So it 's easier to meet people because they know you 're new and then with that church . I had like a few gals that I get to meet with weekly and it 's nice because we 're all in different life stages , so kind of getting to know them , and then there 's"
No," I eat people who have shared interests , and that says you write yes , uhhuh you 're right those processes . Those can take some time to cool those relationships , but I 'm glad you can see the link between that and n. Even the nutrition right . Your your big vision"
No," , okay , so thinking about your well vision really being having this . What sounds like ? Is this balanced and good relationship with physical activity ? Nutrition right ? But it sounds like the physical activity ? Is there really ? The"
No, focus is gon na be . I starts behavior change on nutrition and it sounds like you have some you identify your strengths or how relates to that . What what support systems do you think you have around you that can help you with that and be something as simple as your
Environment," relationships around you , but it also could be things in your environments . You know resources that you have around you kind of think about big picture yeah . I definitely think the food that we bring into the house and I because it 's been such a busy season for my husband"
No," and the primary grocery shopper . I control that okay , so I recognize that if it 's not in the house , it 's not a problem , but if it is and I 'm the one who brought it in then most likely , I 'm gon na be the one who eats it and my husband and brotherinlaw to potentially But for"
No," sure me so earlier you mentioned the going out with friends , because friends are often like coming and visiting , and so everything seems like a soso sounded like eating out was a piece of that . Would you like cakes or is it primarily just the foods that you 're buying and"
No," first thing you brought up was a support structure . That 'S based within you , so I would love to explore some support structures that do n't yeah , maybe things around you yeah , absolutely so definitely my husband is probably one of the most self disciplined people . I"
No," immediate one , because he lives with me , but I also you know have friends in in this field who I can Reach out to you as well and just say : hey , I love ideas . I love what works for you guys . What even if you checked in with me , like all sorts of accountability , I think yeah awesome ."
No," So your husband is a great resource . Cuz . He lives in there . He wants the best , for you , he 's also very self disciplined right and has a health book in us right . It also sounds like you have some of the network 's as far as friends , but not who can kind of help you . Maybe if you have"
No," questions about things , but also just keep you accountable , then things like that right . Definitely have you had any these conversations about this with friends , family or even your husband , a little but not much . I I 'd say not really with friends yet um"
No," and a little with even kind of noticing , like the amount of caffeine . I intake so my husband and I kind of working on transitioning to some decaf , coffee and stuff , like that . So you 've had some nutrition related conversation with your husband Kathy . Tell me a little bit more"
No," then hit like a really busy season . So it 's been hurting again , so , okay , yeah back to it yeah exactly okay , um ! Is that something that you might want to explore later when we go into some changes nutritionally and things like yeah ? Okay ? So , if we 're thinking"
No," but so yeah , I think that 's a challenge - ai n't , a good thing , probably but sure I think because of the connection piece , if others are like , if my husband or brotherinlaw decides like . Oh , I 'm gon na open up a beer and I had already previously decided . I was n't it 's really"
No," coincide ? I do . I think it just takes a little more intention and because I 've done it before where I 've chosen like I , I can think of some times where I 've gone out to eat and I 've chosen what felt what I knew would feel better energy wise in my body , and I have n't"
No," felt like I missed out , and I also can , if I can make that connection more often in my brain of like if I have energy , I can actually connect with people better and be present with them . You know recognizing that hey food can be a connection and the fun you"
No," that - and so I think , that 's that 's important - to kind of consider as you 're as you 're thinking about the changes that you potentially want to make right . So what I would love to do is let 's , let 's kind of summarize and reflect on the vision and then , if it 's okay with"
Environment," you mind kind of receding in your own words ? Maybe No so my vision is to have energy , to make good connections with people and to have not only my exercise , but my food choices and nutrition choices support the ability to be present and make those"
No," connections . I love it . I 'M just typing away here . Look great ! I really like your your choice of words . How do you feel about committing to this ? I feel good . I think it 's something I 've been thinking about , but it 's nice to talk about it and kind of see the line"
No," husband and possibly like a friend or two of yeah of hey , I 'm trying to kind of tweak this a little bit . What would that look like and , and then I yeah - I do n't know if it would be helpful . This is just a thought of like kind of looking ahead and seeing the times that are more"
No," celebratory and knowing that hey I 've got those to look forward to you . So then I know like okay , but for these days I 'm going to fuel my body . Well , you know so just to clarify thinking ahead into the future and and having a good understanding of those events that you"
No," really wo n't want us ready , yeah right so that you do n't um celebrate on the other day , so that maybe are n't what you think our celebration Got it exactly she you want to value or when you want to kind of focus in on the celebrations . Okay , I think almost kind of calendar or"
No," for that . That will help with your vision . I think finding a way to remind myself that that I really do value that connection with people , and that might so . My energy is important because I again , I know who that , but it 's so like far tucked away in my brain , that I do n't"
No," this threemonth goal , so transitioning into decaf . More often having this conversation with your husband and friends thinking through the future of when you really want to celebrate things like one of the big things that are gon na happen , mmhmm"
No," can be finding a way to remember how important that energy is to you . Actually , yes , okay ! So , let 's , if you one of the things that happens with these 3month goals , is and even any kind of goals , it 's usually a good idea to have a few that are"
No," really solid and you feel comfortable about um , where you 're concentrating on those and able to kind Of drive forward with your vision with those specific goals , so thinking know about your 3month goal . What would be a few that you really are"
No," finding a way to remind myself of what my actual value is . Okay in that wanting to connect with people - let 's , let 's , if you 're , okay with that , take these and try to make them a little bit more tailored and specific , so um , I 'm sure you 've heard of the acronym smart"
No," goals before okay , so we 're gon na set some SMART Goals right now , if you would n't mind kind of trying to take each one of those the coffee and then remembering how energy can help with your connection , eating both of those that kind of thinking through a way to"
No," make them smart goals . Okay , so with the coffee , remembering that this is your 3month goal , record yeah time frame is bigger for this one . Okay , so I think yeah . I think I do n't know . What do you suggest ? That 'S the interesting question . So what do you ? What have you set any goals in"
No," actual value of this , like the energy will help you with connection yeah . What would be three months ? What would be a goal you want to meet for that ? I think . Well , I can . I can see because again with holiday time , it 's gon na be a lot of family that I want to connect with"
No," mmhmm , and so just recognizing that I guess in three months . I want to look back and feel like I had the energy I did what I could to make myself available for those connections and really present during that time . I do n't know if I answered the"
No," think about , I think feeling as though , during the days I 've eaten like Ferb breakfast lunch . Any snacking in between I 've really eaten things that fuel my body , because then that fuels me for the day of being with family and then , if I do eat some celebratory things , it 's more"
No," in the evening like sure before going to bed , because that 's so , I still Get both you know the celebration , but I have n't taken away from the connection and the energy to have that connection with my family , but then I also majority of the time I 'm still eating food . That fuels me"
No," people here mmhmm when I 'm maybe not cooking at home , all the time or like that yeah , but for the rest of the . So can I ask a clarifying question ? Absolutely oh , it sounds like in three months you want to look back and feel that you did everything that you could and what that"
No," gon na know how you allow yourself some grace and be able to connect with family and via food and treats , and things like that , is this a daily Thing that you feel comfortable doing is this a you know a few times a week thing or just you"
No," normal foods for you to eat so that you can have those moments of celebration with your family . I understand that . Okay , how does that feel good , yeah ? Okay ? Does it feel doable ? It does feel doable . It feels like it 'll stretch me , but I think that 's good . You"
No," when I go to coffee shops buying tea is a lot cheaper . So if I can like work my way towards that , that would be great with with the other one um , I think , just being able to connect with people . I do n't get to see with see very often like my family during the holidays or"
No," these friends that are planning on visiting . So I want to just like , enjoy and soak up all that time and I think too , since we are seeing my family for the holidays . I want to be kind of a good leader in that for my husband as well so to make sure , like you know , he feels"
No," included , but also that he can do the things that fill him up too . So I think that takes just that intentionality for me , which takes energy and meaning be a good leader . Do you mean be a good leader by making sure this is something that you 're doing daily or being a good"
No," leader and that you 're fostering those connected just with him and yeah being a good leader that I 'm fostering the connections with him as well ? And I think , because it is my family and he needs a lone time , that it will , even though he can tell me when he does need it , I think"
No," it actually works better , if I say hey by the way I get out of here now . This is a good time and so recognizing that mmhmm takes me because I 'm not an introvert takes me a lot more energy and concentration . I guess in the moment to be like . Oh , this is a good time"
No," doing anything like really huge and mindblowing with the family . Ah , if you want to take some time away , I hate that I do n't know yeah . So it 's me , it sounds like this benefit of , so you describe the advantage for yourself of making the change of only"
No," you know kind of having the the celebratory meals three times a week as you had as a connection with others , where the know . How do i express it 's the limiting it to three times a week ? It seemed like there was more of a connection to your husband , so what what"
No," , I have the energy to devote to work that I want to to have the clarity of mind that , because we need some creativity in our work and for teaching so to be able to to put everything I can into the work that I wanted to . You and kind of view it at the caliber that I want to use . I"
Environment," think yeah just feeling good in my body in the sense of like I 'm , treating it with the care it deserves , because it 's been a good body , you know and so to sustain it , and so it 's almost , I see it as a way of loving myself . Well , you know not only doing the exercise that feels"
No," month goal yeah ? I think I think talking with my husband again about incorporating the decaf again and then buying some more so we have it in those yeah , I 'm trying to think cuz . I wanted to kind of take the caffeine by noon so maybe finding whether I 'm either not at"
No," , yeah , okay can . Can we go back and make them SMART goals ? So let 's start with the one about you talking to your husband , yeah um , I mean I can do that because he 'll probably ask me about this . I can do that as early as this evening and"
No," to your husband today about incorporating more decaf , but it made clear that you 're also gon na talk to him about your your 3month goal : yeah : okay , um . How about the buying more decaf in the house ? How can you make that a SMART goal yeah , I think , the next time I go to"
No," smart goal ? Yeah ? I think I think it will help to tell my husband about that . One you okay , there 's again , as I said before , he 's a really good resource to help with like health things and then yeah , I think almost making it a habit to check what time I 'm leaving the house to go to the"
No," weekly goals for the caffeine . Do you want to move on to weekly goals for the kind of food choices ? Sure right do , you think , would be good supportive , weekly goals for your three months goal . Let 'S see yeah , I think again telling my husband what my plan is when we 're"
No," traveling in terms of you know hey , I I want to eat just things that give me energy until dinnertime and after and then I mean I could still eat things that give me Energy but yeah , and when do you want to do that , bye tell him I 'll . Probably probably tonight"
No," friend Michelle , who also is Picon house that she loves talking about this stuff , so I think she 'd actually welcomed the conversation which is fun , and when will you talk to her about that um ? I will probably talk to her . I say by tomorrow at the latest"
No, that threshold ? So maybe you could pick one of your kind of the caffeine goals that you think is most prevalent to yourself or what you think is the most important that you want to focus on yeah . I think the talking to my husband about mmhmm kind of switching it up here in
No," have and I this will probably be the first time I 've ever ordered a decaf drink . I 'D , say : 7 ! Oh , no ! Ok ! 7 ! Out of 10 ! Now , what do you think ? Why do you think it 's not maybe like a 5 y 7 , I feel pretty confident . They'Ll have something because my mom orders decaf any time"
No," we 're together and every coffee shop has happened with something . Ok , so , even though I have n't ever checked that specifically at this coffee shop , my guess is they 'll have something that is lower in caffeine . Wonderful , so , through vicarious experience this with your mom"
No," you feel about talking to your husband about the food piece of it tonight ? I 'D say I 'd say probably like an 85 um . So why do you point 5 ? I think that the width in comparison to the first thing , I 'm talking about that 's , already been something we 've kind of tried out he 's"
No," , ok and then how about talking to your friends about your plans for food when you travel mm I 'd , say good night . Ok , strong yeah , okay , so before we move to the wrapup um , if you 're , ok with it , I would love for you and I 'm gon na I 'm gon na send a followup email with this"
No," information , but I would love for you to just kind of restate some of Your goals is that , ok , that you could do that mmhmm so for the caffeine . Go ! I 'M going to talk to my husband tonight about wanting to incorporate more decaf here at home and then probably the"
No," can order awesome . There 'S that one and then the other talking to my husband about my eating goals for the holidays tonight as well , and then talking to you friend Rochelle about that again , I think , probably by latest tomorrow . So I got some stuff in the next few days yeah . But"
Environment, workplace and inherently tied to that is teams and teamwork . It 'S you know it 's really hard to have a leader without a team and then supplementing that with training . A large part of my research focuses on
Environment," developing leaders and developing teams , and so the science of training , and how to do that . Well , i 'm sure that you 've all been in some sort of experience . That 'S uh training like that . You just feel like you did n't , get a whole lot out of"
Environment," um and it 's because i 'm not following the science of training and uh . That 'S part of what i do and then , as clemente mentioned , i specialize in occupational health psychology . So , whereas industrial organizational psychology focuses largely on"
No," how work integrates with family , and so i also like to mention that we 're more than just our jobs um , so i 'm new father and i 'm also married to an iowa psychologist and an occupational health psychologist , dr kimberly french"
Environment," um ? It concerns the application of psychology to improving the quality of work life and protecting and promoting the safety , health and wellbeing of workers and you 're going to see across a couple of different dimen . Uh"
Environment," definitions of this field that safety , health and wellbeing are sort of the three key dimensions right of occupational health psychology . There 'S the safety bucket looking at how things like accidents or injuries , can occur in the workplace"
Environment," or rather than saying , go use this machine to do this . Job have fun , we put you through a training beforehand and uh maybe give you some clear manuals on how to use it as an example . On the other side , there 's"
Environment," this promotion component , which is focused on the workers themselves , because you can lead a horse water , but you ca n't force them to drink same thing with safety and health and things along those lines . We can have all the organizational"
Environment," policies and practices we want , but if people do n't care about their own safety and health and wellbeing , you ca n't necessarily make them follow those so there 's some research , certainly on um the individual side of things of"
Environment," health and safety , which feels Shockingly relevant , i think there are some very clear examples of this in our current society . Right like if you take masking , for example , or taking the vaccine , you can have"
Environment," how literally the physical workplace is designed , um because things like hvac or noise and heat small spaces . These are all workplace risk factors that impact again safety"
No," What is it that people are working on and you can see things um , ranging from workplace bullying to daily wellbeing , burnout and depression ? I 'M sure people that 's top of mind right now . Burnout has made it sort of into the public"
No," consciousness selfcompassion , so getting to that wellness side and then definitely stress um , retaliation from abusive supervision and then obviously , there 's been a lot of research on uh covid . The coronavirus"
Environment," , lockdowns things along those lines , and so you can see there 's a broad range of research , so anything that touches the workplace and sort of health , wellbeing or safety falls under that umbrella of"
Environment," back in 1845 , there was a publication that linked the health problems of the working class in england to the social and physical environment , including the workplace , and so over . You know a hundred years ago , um people 150 years ago . I guess people"
Environment," actually um reduced um , reduced injuries and improved their health in the long run , which is pretty cool and then in the 70S 1970 . We have the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh um , which is"
Environment," under the cdc , the centers for disease control , um and then 1971 . Osha , occupational safety and health administration was founded . So clearly , a government push for recognizing the need to"
No," showed the exact same thing , and i think this past year and a half also kind of made that clear right when you 're calling out sick , because you have covid for two weeks . That 'S two weeks of you not being able to do your job or , if you have to"
No," organizations , not necessarily in the short run right . Any sort of intervention is going to cost money in the short run , but when you look at the money , you 're saving from workman 's comp , um payments and insurance payments um to"
Environment," do n't become an ohp person , so uh now that you 've had like a really brief overview of the field . I just want to go into some of the topics that we cover , starting with safety , moving into stress"
Environment," , um ? Certainly , there 's this avoiding unnecessary risks , so you can have the option of doing things fast , uh or doing things right and safe right , oftentimes , our safety behaviors take more time"
Environment," right . Infectious diseases that you might be handling , so you want to make sure that you 're handling materials safely and then using personal protective equipment and then other safety equipment so related . Like"
Environment," workplace equipment to even something like the wet uh signs that you put up on the floor , that would be safety equipment that employees can choose to not use , but we hope that they wo n't right"
No," also your physiological experience . Looking at your brain looking at hormones things along those lines , but most of our models are at the psychological construct level . So thinking about the experience"
Environment," , so we have safety climate . This is essentially duh . Do you feel like in your workplace ? Everyone values safety right , so you can imagine there are certain workplaces that put an emphasis on safety"
Environment," have fresh bread , but also to like let their Coworkers know that someone 's carrying something very hot they 're handling an unsafe material and they do n't want to bring their their coworkers , and so that would be high safety climate"
Environment," , whereas you could imagine some other workplace where people haphazardly wear protective personal protective equipment . Maybe that 's even frowned upon , because it 's not the cool thing to do , and so that 'd be low in safety climate"
Environment, and there are sort of two things that go into it . There 'S the management value so from top down is the organization valuing safety . Are they promoting it and then also from the individual level um and the the cowork level ? Some of the
Environment," things that we talked about going to safety climate then um . If you 're working in a place , that 's high in safety climate ? Ideally that 's going to lead to safety ! Knowledge , maybe there 's some things that you just do n't know are unsafe or you do n't know"
Environment," , all of which are directly uh impacted by that safety , climate and then ultimately , um . What is your safety task performance ? We can literally quantify your performance on safety . Behaviors right . Are you shouting hot bread ? Every time you see , hot bread ?"
Environment," Are you wearing your n95 mask appropriately correctly or are there errors in how you 're wearing it and then safety , contextual performance , which is not necessarily your safety performance , but maybe you helping other"
Environment," people be safe , um , so you 've got your mask on now , you 're helping other people . Wear it and encouraging them to wear it um , it 's a balance betw between production and safety , as i 've mentioned , oftentimes safety"
Environment," amongst both employers as well as employees . You have to help them believe that safety is important , that accidents are preventable and that personal protective equipment works . Um again , i think we 've seen really clear examples of this . In the last year , um"
Environment," , interestingly , gender kind of inter uh intersects with safety men are most of the workplace fatalities , even though they make up only about half of the workforce . Part of this is men tend to be in like"
Environment," riskier workplaces . Things like mining or construction , but also men , tend to make riskier choices and they 're less likely to adhere to safety , uh guidelines and principles and there 's some work . That suggests that"
Environment," mood swings ? Are you nervous , anxious and then openness to experience , um and we see of those five agreeableness and conscientiousness are particularly important for um safety right agreeable people tend to also be rule . Followers"
Environment," and conscientious people recognize the importance of safety , so people who are high in those tend to be high in safety . So imagine if you 're , an employer you 'd want to hire people who are high in agreeableness and conscientiousness ."
Environment," If you have a particularly unsafe work environment because they 'll go that extra mile to be safe , so that 's like i said a brief smattering of safety . Kind of shifting gears now into stress . Um stress is really interesting and we"
No, They can rate . Maybe they 've had objectively stressful experiences like having a family member die or graduating high school applying to colleges . Some of these events have been ranked as major life events that have
Environment," sort of a point value of how stressful they are , or maybe they 've experienced a certain number of daily hassles , something like commuting traffic or getting into an argument with a colleague or maybe just things In their life , do n't"
Environment, experience . The psychological distress might peak very shortly thereafter things along those lines . Then we have something like slips in response to not wearing your safety shoes and that can cause either
No," shortterm outcome or longterm outcome again . Um or a workfriendly conflict episode right . Maybe you had to stay late at work , to get a project done and now you 're missing dinner with your family um , and that might result in you just"
No," having a negative mood when you get home , but you sleep and you 're you 're over it um so a whole Range of acute um stressors , on the other hand , we have chronic stressors , and these are things that you"
No," We get back pain , um or other uh , worse outcomes from that , i suppose um or we maybe we 're not talking about physical experiences , we 're talking about psychological , so chronic , workplace , bullying or maybe chronic financial insecurity ."
No," Your job is n't paying you well enough um , and so that is a longterm stressor , and so these i 've been associated with things like clinical depression anxieties and so on those lines as well , but also physical health outcomes . I do n't want it to seem , like um"
No," workplace again , is not giving you the amount of time that you need the control that you need to do your job or the Money that you need to do your job or to live your life successfully . We talked about work , family or worklife"
Environment," conflict . It 'S not just interfering with your family can also be interfering with other components of your life like going to the gym , but i also want to say that it 's only dark there there 's potential enhancement too , that people"
No," look at that bonus side of how it can work , Enhance your life and your family experience , job insecurity , and so again this is something we 've experienced a lot of in the last year and a half people not sure . Are you going to get fired any moment ?"
No," musculoskeletal disorders as we talked about so things like carpal tunnel syndrome or tendonitis or back pain ? It 'S the third leading reason for disability or retirement , and it 's the leading workplace health"
No, Health behaviors and so there 's a recognition that your work impacts your health paper . So are you eating healthy for you ? Are you drinking a lot of alcohol ? Are you smoking or using other forms of tobacco ? Are you using
No," illicit drugs things along those lines ? Are you getting enough sleep ? Are you engaging in proper sleep hygiene , so you 're going to bed at the same time , every night you 're , not working in bed or right before bed ? All of those are strains that we can"
No," look at as outcomes of the stress process . Again , physical symptoms and then psychological symptoms as well , what 's really interesting and i think also useful , even if you do n't ever end up touching um occupational health psychology , is"
Environment," something that might be taking away your resources , it threatens your selfidentity or your safety um . It 'S also stressful you 're not going to gain anything from exposure to it um , so this is definitely leading towards"
No," , whereas with challenge you 're ready to fight that bear right . We have to push that blood into your periphery , so you have the muscle muscular strength to deal with that um and then there 's this other weird uh"
No," type of stressor , which is a hindrance . It 'S not quite to that level of threat . It 'S not threatening your resources . Necessarily ! It 'S not learning your selfidentity , but you ca n't gain anything from it . This is like bureaucracy , red tape"
Environment," threats or hindrances , but being exposed to challenges . You'Re training right , you 're learning , growing um , but even if you 're exposed to challenges only you can be exposed to too many challenges , and that"
Environment," , and so this model says That you have a stimulus in the environment , you perceive that stimulus and then you engage in the primary appraisal . So first probably nonconsciously your brain says . Is this good for me ? So is it positive ? Might it be giving me resources"
No," , like your job , is actually doing something good and doing something good for you and society and what are the positive outcomes for that ? Looking at mindfulness , you know , mindfulness is sort of a two double edged sword right now"
No," , um a lot of companies are throwing mindfulness at all of their problems when um mindfulness is just a tool and a bucket and it 's taking something that can be have an organizational Solution and putting it on the individual and saying like oh"
No," , if only you were more mindful , you could handle all of these stressors that i 'm throwing at you um . Hence the doubleedged sword . But there are a lot of really cool positive benefits to mindfulness and there 's a lot of"
No, empirical research on mindfulness um and then something else . That 'S really hot right now is looking at breaks and vacation and detaching from work and basically finding out how you can recover
Environment," health psychology , this is just a list of some of the centers of excellence and also research training centers . So these are schools that have ohp explicit centers , though that 's not to say , they 're , the only places doing ohp"
Environment," being um having lower income is in of itself a stressor , and we see a like a broad range of negative health outcomes of that um . And then we can also turn that around say , like hey workplaces , here 's some incentive to pay your people more"
Environment," and being abused , um , and so that 's also tends to be the story with financial stress and low income . Is that um ? That and of itself is a stressor , but it also brings on a lot of other stressors which"
No," psychology . You know we are social creatures and i think , at the very least , it gives you the tools , both mathematical there 's , a lot of statistics in psychology , um and then also logical thinking about how x leads to y leads to z , um and"
No," They had fulltime jobs , full families and i think the fastest i 've seen someone go through a phd program . He was highly motivated was three years um , but that 's it 's doable um , whereas , like"
No," my wife for example , she started with uh getting her masters um , which was , i believe , two years , and then she was in a phd our phd program for an additional six years . So that 's eight years on top of an undergrad , so it 's really"
Environment," areas of psychology where , if you want to do therapy and counseling , you could get only a master 's and be licensed as a therapist um , you get a phd you 're gon na get paid more . Ultimately , right the more education , more training , more specialization"
Environment," , um and engage in bullying um . So you want to hire people that wo n't have behind those traits uh . You also want to have again sort of a safety climate , but instead of a safety climate , psychological safety . So you want to"
Environment," encourage uh , create an environment where bullying 's not tolerated where people feel empowered to call each other out if they are bullying um , they feel supported by the workplace to report bullying um , and so there are multiple different"
No," wanted uh to have like work . Life balance and i recognize in in medicine , there 's again a wide range . You can be like family practice and have some work with balance or you can be trauma surgeon in the uh er and have"
No," can um , but i will say that like , for example , social pain , um so being rejected , activates the same brain centers to relative to the same degree as physical pain . So , like being punched um other than like the somatic"
No," part of your brain um , it activates the same sort of pain , regions , negative affect regions , and i think you can see sort of a similar thing with workplace stressors of the same types of brain regions . That can be activated and then add like in your example : uh"
Environment," like safety behaviors , and so that is exposing you to more stressors um yeah . I wish i could give you a clear answer , but that 's like a full lecture , um distress week in the immune system , nelson yeah"
No," organization and what they value like what their resources are . But yeah hr is first and foremost , and i 'm just gon na put this plugin if you feel like you 've , been discriminated against for either your actual or perceived"
No," um , so hr , usually the organization you work for usually has an eap , employee , assistantship program and those are the ones that provide some sort Of mental health , counseling assistance and then the second thing i want to"
Environment," working with policies , creating training programs , etc . So , even if an employee has you know , need some sort of psychological help , they would be referred to a counseling or clinical psychologist , so we think of more broader kind of"
No," , whether it 's you know pursue thinking of this as a possible career option or just something you may want to explore . Uh in regards to your study and seeing how that connects to the courses you 're already taking whether it 's critical health issues"

No," Unlimited CEUs for Counselors $ 59 at AllCEUscom , hey there , everybody and welcome to this video on 20 ways . Your attitude impacts your health and mood and six ways to improve your hardiness or your attitude . I 'M your host , Dr DawnElise Snipes attitude , is all about perception , but optimism and hope can actually be just as toxic as pessimism when taken to the extreme , when somebody is always optimistic and saying : oh it 'll get better or um well just being optimistic and ignoring what is Actually happening it can be just as toxic . Unfortunately , as humans , we tend to notice the negative and need to train ourselves to also embrace the positive , and this is called tragic optimism . It recognizes that"
No," there 's the tragic part . This is the part that sucks and there 's this part over here uh , as I 'm thinking I 'm thinking of uh some biscuits . I made the other day and tragic optimism . I burned the bottom of them to an absolute crisp , but the upper 5 6 of them was just fine . So I cut off the bottom crust and you know it was good . Was it as pretty not quite but that 's tragic optimism . I embraced the fact that hey I burned the bottom and the rest of them , the rest of the biscuit tastes just fine , so think about that , embracing it and recognizing it another example . I usually give is my animals love . My animals love my animals to death and I would n't want to be"
No," , you 're brushing your teeth , but you know it 's hard to actually get the job done . Hardiness is an attitude , and it 's kind of like tragic optimism , but hardiness was a term that was coined back in the 70s by kobasa . A hearty attitude means a commitment to using our energy to control or nurture what 's important in our lives and recognizing problems as challenges and opportunities to grow . Now , there 's a lot there , but basically it 's commitment , control and Challenge and having that attitude is so important . Hearty attitudes are associated with lower blood pressure when you view life you 're , you see all of the things in your life that you 're committed"
No," to you recognize . Okay , this stuff over here may be going kind of crappy , but I 've got all this that I 'm committed to um and I 'm focusing on and realizing the power . I have to address the things that are within my control . Then it 's less draining Less triggering on the stress Response system , when you approach something with curiosity , seeing it as a challenge or a puzzle instead of seeing it as a barrier that is going to prevent you from having a meaningful life . You know you can see how the different attitude would reduce the stress response when we have a lower stress response , when that HPA axis is n't completely pegged out we have improved sleep"
No," When our HPA axis does its normal , you know it triggers for stress and it down regulates . When the stress is gone , you know it 's a wellfunctioning system , then we have reduced inflammation . We have reduced pain because serotonin stays higher . We have improved immunity because cortisol is able to do its job and it 's not causing overactivity or dysregulation of the immune system . We have improved energy , you know think about how draining it is when you are pessimistic , when you are approaching life and seeing life as through a negative lens and everywhere you look , you see , threats that is exhausting , so we have improved energy when we start recognizing . Okay , you know"
No," yeah , there are some things in this world that I can not control , but there are some things I can cool . Let me focus on those . What parts can I control and Hearty attitudes are also Associated , interestingly enough , but probably not surprising , with nutrition and weight management ? When people are stressed , they tend to gravitate toward high fat high sugar foods for long energy from fat as well as short bursts of energy from sugar and the bursts of dopamine , because high fat high sugar foods tend to be what we call feel good foods anyway . When people are feeling hearty , they tend to be less anxious , less distressed , so they 're doing less selfmedicating"
Environment," of cortisol released when your HPA axis is not working . Well , then , whether when there 's a stressor most of the time , there 's either none or a tsunami of stress hormones released . So , keeping that HPA axis is one of the main benefits overall of of hardiness . It helps us avoid unnecessary distress . People who are Hardy also have increased happiness and hope , because they are recognizing the stuff that sucks we 're not ignoring that we 're not minimizing it , but they 're . Also , recognizing the things that are going right , the things that they do have the security that they do have they 're , recognizing that they"
No," are not totally powerless , that they do have control over some aspects of every situation and they are recognizing things that come their way as Challenges they 're starting to be able to look at those and go okay . Well , I 've been through harder things in the past and survived , or I 've been through similar things in the past and made it through . How can I address this instead of looking at something going ? I do n't know what to do with this . They are a more able to call on those older schema because they 're not In Perpetual fight or flight they 're , able to activate that executive control center . The higher order , thinking and figure out how to problem solve how awesome"
Environment," and they have improved motivation when you think you can do something when you think that using energy is going to have a positive effect , you tend to be more motivated .

No," cognitively hearty attitudes are associated with improved problem . Solving , remember , I said you 're not in fight or flea you 're . Actually , in your wise mind , which means you 're going to be able to use that wisdom , imagine that improved creativity and cognitive flexibility think about when you 're stressed or when you 're in a negative State of Mind how creative are you I know , I 'm not very creative . I I feel very stuck I get stuck in that box . I have difficulty imagining or thinking of alternative ways to approach things . My cognitive flexibility is is almost nil . I become much more rigid . This is , this is a nail needs to be hit with a hammer . There 'S nothing else to do when"
No," I 'm being more cognitively flexible . I may see a nail , but if I do n't have a hammer I say : okay , what could I use instead and I can be really creative out here on the farm . You know a lot of times , things like that do happen , and I improvise and that 's cognitive flexibility , but if you 're feeling negative , if you 're feeling distressed or in fight or flight you 're not going to have that luxury people who are Hardy have improved concentration , they 're , not hyper , Vigilant they 're not scanning for threats all over the place because they feel safe and empowered . They recognize their ability to control certain things . They recognize that everything is not all bad which helps them"
No," stay in their wise mind and focus on what 's right in front of them . There 'S improved frustration , tolerance . I encourage you to think again of times that you 've been distressed , whether you 're , sick or you 're , exhausted or you 're just distressed for some reason . How long was your patience fuse versus times when things were going ? Well , most people when they are feeling overwhelmed when they are feeling negative or pessimistic , hopeless , helpless , unsafe , have very little frustration , tolerance . They may try something for half a second and if it does n't immediately work for them , it 's like fine . Forget it do n't have the energy , do n't have the desire ? Okay well that's actually the body"
No," saying this is not the time to focus on learning a new task . Energy and desire is to fight or flee , so it makes sense they would have that reaction , but we do need to recognize that and embrace it , and people who have a hearty Outlook tend to have fewer intrusive thoughts and ruminations . We know that as Sleep Quality goes down , intrusive thoughts and ruminations go up . It 'S actually harder to control our thoughts and our cognitive autopilot when we are sleep deprived . So when people are feeling empowered when they are feeling safe , they they 're inner Watchdog , um or inner risk manager , is n't constantly knocking on their door . Going do n't forget about this , be on"
Environment," the lookout for that do n't forget about this . You know that little area of your brain that the amygdala can settle down a little bit and they can focus on . What 'S what is in the moment , environmentally hearty attitudes are associated with a greater awareness of the positive aspects of the situation and the environment . Again , there can be there 's almost always something : that 's not a hundred percent perfect , but hearty attitudes say : okay , that 's not a hundred percent perfect , but let 's look at everything else that went really well or let 's look at how things went well , despite the fact that it was n't A hundred percent perfect um if you 've gotten married , you"
No," know that 's a great example for a lot of people . Most people 's weddings or their receptions do not go off a hundred percent perfect . It is not that Hallmark , storybook wedding that you anticipate or you hope for something 's gon na happen , you 're going to break a heel you 're going to stain your dress . The car is going to break down . I do n't know whatever it is , that 's going to happen , But people with hearty attitudes are able to say okay well , this sucks , let 's drop back in punt . Let 'S look at everything else , that 's going well and in the big scheme of things this is n't that big of a deal you know um or in the big scheme of things , this turned out 90 awesome ."
No," Well , if you look at a grading scale , 90 is still an a you know so um overall it was a success . Relationally hearty attitudes are associated with increased relationship , satisfaction , improved social support and improved selfesteem . When people have a hearty attitude , it 's similar to looking outside at the things that you have in your life and the things that you have in your job that are going well versus going crappy selfesteem , you can evaluate yourself and say all right . I have n't achieved 100 selfactualization . These are the things I 'm still working on , but these are the things about myself that are awesome . You can look at people that you 're"
No," in relationships with or your children . You know nobody 's perfect and you can say all right . These are the things that are n't my favorite about this person , but these are all the things I love about this person , people with a negative attitude , focus on well yeah . They have all this good stuff over there , but oh there 's one thing : they do grinds my gears and I 'm just gon na focus on that and that detracts from the relationship that creates a lot of resentment and hostility in relationships . So there 's a lot more relationship . Satisfaction when we can appreciate the other person 's strengths when we , even if they 're different and I 've talked before"
No," in in other videos about temperament . My husband and I are very , very different and some of his temperamental um related things are very different than mine , and initially it was bothersome to me because it was n't my way . But as soon as I let go of that , and I started embracing the fact that okay he 's more spontaneous than I am well that 's great , because when things go wrong , he 's able to think on his feet when things go wrong , I start spiraling , I 'm like crap . This is not how it was supposed to go , so I appreciate that fact in him . I appreciate the differences in other people and I look for ways we can synergize and that 's a hearty attitude . A negative attitude"
No," would be one of jealousy or judgmentalism when we appreciate others for who they are , instead of trying to change them when we appreciate others for who they are with their problems or whatever it increases the strength of our relationship and improves our social support , Because they feel accepted for who they are false and all and then we can feel accepted for who we are false and all so . How do we improve this hardiness thing ? Well , the first thing I know an attitude of gratitude . How many times do people say that and you roll your eyes ? Basically , what we 're talking about here is not prancing around just telling everybody"
No," to get over under around through they 're in your way , they 're not ideal , but it 's a challenge to figure out how to get past them and they can be overcome barriers . Not so much barriers are there and they stop you dead in your tracks . So if you see problems as obstacles or challenges , then it can spark that notion of curiosity . How , if I solve similar things to this before or who do I know or who , can I think of that solved similar problems , and what did they do ? E stands for energy on what you can control ? Don'T Focus energy on trying to change other people , because you ca n't change other people . Don'T Focus energy on being angry , that you 're having a snowstorm tomorrow and you 're"
No," supposed to be at work , ca n't control the weather . Just ca n't do it do n't Focus energy on the things you ca n't control , because that 's just burning up energy you might as well . You know , go out to your car and start siphoning gas and you know giving it to somebody else . Definitely not wasting it but um . You know that 's a waste of energy you 're , not benefiting from that energy and small steps . Think of what is one thing I can do today to move forward . If we set steps that are too big , then we start feeling defeated . We start feeling like it 's impossible to reach that goal so set goals , even little ones , break them down literally into things that can be accomplished in a day when I"
No," do spring cleaning , I break it down room by room . So one day , I 'm gon na work on the uh laundry room another day or two , I 'm gon na work on the garage another day , I 'm gon na work on my bedroom . Instead of saying I need to get spring cleaning done and then going . I do n't know where , to start with those small steps , I can see progress and if you notice these all add up to the mnemonic Graces gratitude , all aspects challenges energy on what you can control and small steps . Next time , you 're faced with a challenge notice it what it is , what it is instead of getting angry about it , instead of being afraid of it , just notice it and get curious notice . What is also going well"
No," , what resources you have to deal with it and what you can learn from it notice and then decide how to proceed . Are you going to accept it because it 's something you ca n't control or do n't want to use Your energy on , or are you going to embrace the , and are you going to say this part 's ugly , do n't like it and this part 's good , so I 'm going to embrace it , I 'm going to accept that not everything 's perfect or are you going to proceed with hope and Determination you have hope that you can affect a positive change and you 're determined to make that happen . Life is not always sunshine and Roses , but the way you approach adversity can have"
No," a significant impact on your health , mental health and your relationships"
No," in positive psychology and what I would like to do in this presentation similar . What we did with gratitude is to give you a sense of what do we know about what optimism is , what impact it has on psychological functioning Also on our physical health . I found a study when I was preparing this lecture"
No," , We do n't know very much about the origins of optimism , But there is this view now that if you have children , the single most important thing you can do as a parent is to raise a child with strong optimism . It may be that will influence everything in that child 's life is as they get older"
No," , It 's only a cover for sadness , It 's not true happiness , and they gave the example of people who cry the father who cries at his daughter 's wedding . They said he 's not crying out of happiness , He 's crying out of sadness"
No," that he 's losing his special girl and some man who 's , not even in the family . Now it 's gon na control his or dominate his daughter 's life . So in the 1950s it was still influenced by psychoanalytic views , which came from Freud . A very pessimistic of your life Adler was living at the same time as Freud ."
No," really holds up , even though he died in 1937 . I think he understood children better than any thinker in the 20th century and I learned a lot as a clinical psychologist and as a parent in studying Adler 's life . So , having said that , Adler was an optimist by nature . He was described this way"
No," He saw optimism as based on early experience in the family How much physical affection , How much attention , How much encouragement , How much praise is given to the child"
No," , and he was one of the first theorists to see that this could differ by siblings . This is why siblings are very different , Something that 's been noticed for many decades , There 's not high similarity necessarily between siblings , on basic personality traits and Adler 's view was that parents do n't treat the children"
No," and different types from the father . He also felt that optimism is nurtured by the schools , by teachers and in the 1930s he strongly advocated that schools become involved in helping to strengthen psychological functioning in children"
No," The focus has been on teaching academic skills , In particular , Adler felt that warmth and encouragement were key elements in helping children to develop an optimistic personality Again . What we call today trait optimism and he felt that teachers could have a powerful role"
No," most teachers do n't , but it is possible for individual teachers to strengthen children to have an optimistic personality . Adler 'S overall system of personality was by definition , an optimistic view . He felt that we all can learn to manage our lives and to take control over the direction of our lives ."
No," a lot of younger people are interested in selfhelp and developing skills to become more successful . Adler also talked about social interest as an important part of selfhelp . In other words , it 's not simply focused on the self , but it 's learning how to help other people"
No," learning to develop social skills , social awareness , His famous motto , was : any child can learn anything Now . He did n't mean this to be true , literally So , with your population . He was n't crazy . He had school psychologists , social workers who worked with children"
No," who were mentally slow children . Today , we would say were developmentally disabled , But he felt that this should be a model for teachers to have this confidence that basically most children can be taught things and not to blame children"
No," if they do n't grasp concepts In Adler 's view , early interactions with family members peers School teachers and others , as well as biological factors , shape our personality and influence our optimism , So he did have a medical view being trained as a medical doctor that we are"
No," influenced by weaknesses that we have physically that can have an effect on us . This comes up often with children that I see who are victims of bullying , and I know this is a major problem . Now , all over the world , It 's been dealt with pretty well in the United States ."
No," In the last five years , school systems all over the United States have written policies that teachers have to follow to report . Bullying does n't mean it 's not happening anymore , but it 's being taken very seriously and of course many of the children"
No," that I see that are victims of bullying are physically weak . They are smaller than other children , They are scrawny or skinny or smaller . Last week I evaluated a boy who I could tell that he would be a victim of bullying and he told me that he is"
No," because he is smaller and skinnier than children . His age are boys , his age are , and I did some advice or counseling . His mother was in the room also , So he ca n't help that he is born this way . Maybe he will get bigger , but not necessarily"
No," or selfesteem . It 'S not totally different . It was developed by Bandura . You probably have heard of him he 's still alive . I think he 's close to 90 , but he developed many many brilliant concepts of psychology ."
No," He is the father of social learning theory , which I was very impressed with in graduate school and it 's my orientation as a therapist . I see that as how children develop behaviors based on role modeling . So what selfefficacy means is how much do you feel you can handle the challenges of your life ?"
No," If you are college student , your challenge is being a student as it means getting good grades . It means learning the material coming out of school with a degree and maybe continuing to graduate school . If you are older"
No," ways that are n't very effective compared to optimistic people ? So Bandura 's concept and selfefficacy is kind of an outgrowth of Adler 's idea that children who are optimistic , develop confidence in their ability to cope with stresses in life ."
No," In other words , that will give you the ability to hope that you will be successful . So if I were not high in optimism , I would n't have come here . I would have just felt this as too much to come and try to prepare these lectures , and maybe I was n't able to do it in the summer"
No," They will just stick to what they know and that 's okay , but they wo n't be very high achievers . That 'S Bandura 's view of why optimism ties in so much to selfefficacy . In Adler 's view , optimism is especially important in giving you the courage and hope to have satisfying social relationships ."
No, Adlerian psychology is basically all about social relationships . How well you can work with other people ? How successful you are to maintain friendships ? How much you contribute to your community . Do you know other people in your community in your field with colleagues ?
No," As I mentioned , I think Adler understood children better than any other thinker of the 20th century . In Adler 's view , people who have experienced little warmth and affection and encouragement develop a negative worldview , a pessimistic worldview"
Environment," and how we are gon na cope with life as we grow up and get older , So in therapy . Adlerians are very interested in the metaphors that people use to describe their relationships and to describe their environment , and there are many many studies that have"
No," looked at the metaphors that people use in business in health in looking at family life . So what I would like you to do , We will take a little break from the lecture for a couple of minutes . The question is , if I say to you , life is like blank"
No," They are all high on optimism , because these are fields that , if you are not high , you would n't go into it , and I know this as I mentioned earlier today , My parents were teachers . If you do n't believe that children can learn and you can have an impact on them"
Environment," , You would n't go into the field of education . It 'S not high paying anywhere in the world . It 'S an idealistic field , but people who , like being around children , feel that they are having an impact on their own children 's lives . So it makes sense that"
No," these are optimistic people and to go into medicine . You have to believe that you can help people , You can cure them or you can relieve their pain or suffering . So the studies that we have done are consistent with what we would expect for people"
No," As I mentioned earlier now , psychologists say : if there 's one thing you can do for your children , It 's to give them an optimistic view of life . So for this college student to say that he 's very impressed by this philosopher who has an extremely pessimistic view of life , That 's a very destructive attitude for him to have ."
No," That 'S a mistake in Adler 's thinking in the Adlerian psychological approach , Life is full of possibilities and opportunities . It 'S very important to understand that and it comes from Adler 's view and some of you were n't raised that way ."
No," , He became one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century in the field of psychology , social work , family relationships , even in health care . The more we understand the link between mind and body , and he could n't have done this without"
Environment," You can not exercise because it does n't matter you everything . You will still be very healthy and we know that . That 'S not true , So this idea now , I think the medical field may be going too much to the extreme . Now saying , do n't be optimistic at all"
No," hope and optimism are often put together . There is some difference , but the basic idea is the positive feelings about the future and that , in Maslow 's view having a peak experience , elevates mental health , including boosting our optimism . So if you want to become more optimistic"
No," , So they turn to drugs or alcohol as a way to soothe themselves , Also loss of meaning in life . He felt that peak experiences often give us a greater sense of meaning . There is a lot of interest now in positive psychology in life , meaning"
No," , and the third area were peak experiences become relevant . Maslow identified have to deal with depression and anxiety . People suffering from depression often go through long periods with little joy , little sense of optimism"
No," on pessimism and optimism as factors having to do with physical health . I will get to this in a little while , but as I mentioned , a new study showed that optimism may be an important predictor of longevity , A very exciting research , because I think everyone wants to have a long life"
No," So , and it 's been found very clearly that pessimism Is associated with poor physical health ? Now we talked briefly about why it 's not included over here for optimism . Why is it not good to be over here in terms of influencing health ? Why are people very low in optimism"
No," more likely to have poor physical health ? So if we have given some discussion about why you may not be smart to be overly optimistic , but why the pessimistic people - people very low on optimism , Why are they more likely to have poor physical health ? Can you think of some explanations"
Environment," , Yeah the basic ideas of why bother it does n't matter If I am gon na be sick anyway , I am gon na diet in young age anyway . So what is the point I will eat whatever I want to , I wo n't exercise . I wo n't have good social relationships . I actually know people like this myself and"
No," again as that Adler was right . This has nothing to do with IQ or intelligence and sure enough . These are people . I know whose health is much worse than other people , Because they have a pessimistic view . Some of it has to do with looking at one 's family , and I think this is clinically I found this over the years ."
No," and also choices that they make as they get older , A very good friend of mine keeps saying his both his father and his father 's father died by the time they were 70 and he said to me that part Of him feels why bother because that 's gon na that 's his cutoff point and he was a smoker in college ."
Environment," He does n't exercise , He has been overweight for most of his adult life and he eats a lot of junk food and I told him I visited him this summer . I said that , does I said , look you know and he is a very intelligent person . I said the fact that your father and grandfather"
No," - and that seems to have a lot to do with psychological wellbeing , So you wan na , if you want to be a happier person , you need to be more optimistic . Also , I think all parents say they want their children to grow up to be happy people , So it comes up again"
No," that it means that you want to raise a child who has an optimistic view about his or her life and finally , conflict versus harmony . So optimistic people are better at solving conflicts . They are more willing to think that it can be resolved than if you are pessimistic and we will talk about that ."
No, It gets problemsolving strategies . This is what we call it A very important when you are faced with conflicts . You know what do you do if you get into an argument with your friend The different ways you can cope with this Some are healthy and some are not healthy .
No," get a job interview that he was really hoping For a parttime job - and he was saying Dr Hoffman , what did I do wrong ? Can you give me a few minutes and help me ? I said you may not have done anything wrong . They may have been planning to have hire someone else ."
No," you just have to move on . Okay , so that 's what we are talking about . He is thinking to blame himself and it 's probably not psychologically healthy . To do that . I just said that you come on time that you dress appropriately , that you know about the company ."
No," , or do you accept that ? Maybe it had nothing to do with you and you just kind of move on you move on in life . Seligman believes that the optimistic style is someone who tends not to blame himself or herself Overall again , not in every situations , but"
Environment," or who feel that they have that kind of romantic relationship . They are often very low on optimism . There is nothing wrong with their mind , their personality , their income , but they do n't think there is someone out there for them"
No," Okay , So let 's look at this developmentally . Okay , what do we know about children 's optimism because it starts from somewhere where we are not suddenly optimistic or pessimistic when we are 21 years old ? There are antecedents to this"
No," and it 's very important whether you have children or not , to know where this comes from . Okay , Children with high optimism have experienced the parenting style . This is an important concept now in psychology , Parenting style"
No," - If you have n't heard this term before It means that psychologists know that not all parents are the same . You know something you probably knew when you were kids anyway , that if you visited your friends their parents were n't the same as your parents"
No," , parents differ . This has been studied in hundreds or thousands of studies , The impact of parenting style . So these are children . If you have an optimistic personality , you grew up with a parenting style that"
No, help you to be optimistic . What did you experience your parents encourage you to try new things to try different things . You know I come from a very musical family It goes back a hundred seventy years into my ancestors in Eastern Europe .
No," There have been very wellknown in the field of music , and this has been transmitted through my children . Also , it 's probably genetic . I would say So . Parents can encourage their children to learn an instrument or singing and vocal , and if it does n't work out"
No," , you do n't blame your child . They can try something else . That would be an example of encouraging children to develop hobbies to develop interests . Not all parents do that . It 'S been found that parents who impose rules"
No," influential in the field of child psychiatry . She was brilliant and so Maslow was influenced by them and some other people , and he said that children need firm guidance . Children need rules , but they also need the opportunity to try new things ."
No, So it 's not true that parents who give no rules to their children that develop optimistic children - That 's not true . Children need a moderate amount of structure or control . Children need to know who the boss is . Now I do n't think that 's a problem in Hong Kong
No," , from my understanding with colleagues , most kids know pretty well that their parents are the boss , but maybe they need a little more freedom in in trying new things Again . There are cultural differences in the research , But children who have moderately strong rules"
No," growing up are more likely to be optimistic . Parents who develop moderate control over children 's choice of friends and extracurricular activities develop children who are high on optimism . So parents need to know who their friends are , whether they are good for the kids or not"
No," , but not too overly police their children . Children need to experience conflict , and one of the things parents should not do is to intervene when children are not getting along . Children have to learn that how to deal with conflict , not every friendship is gon na last . So parents who exert moderate control are more likely"
No," to have children high on optimism , So in other words , when children experience a moderate autonomy , while growing up , They are likely to have the highest optimism . Interestingly , research shows that this may even operate at the fetal level ."
No," not good for your mental health . One of the flaws of sometimes parents have - and I think parents who emphasize high achievement may be stressing perfectionism too much and it 's wellmeaning . But it 's not healthy , So sudden , my father had this tendency . He was a teacher ."
No," , but not to be a perfectionist . There has been research on marriage and optimism , and that is clear . If you are optimistic , You can accept conflict and do n't feel that there is something wrong with your spouse , because you disagree on something you can accept that"
No," if you want to have the best physical health not to be a ten , but also not to be low . If we have a ten point scale on optimism and the latest research is on greater longevity , We will talk about that in a few minutes . Okay"
No," They can be resolved In the conflict conversation they saw . Their partner is more engaging Again because they do n't give up hope they feel that okay , we disagree , but let 's see if we can work through this and in a oneyear , followup"
No," men 's optimism predicted relationship status , not the woman 's optimism . So maybe it 's a bigger issue for men . It 'S men who are low in optimism may be more prone to anger , or you know it 's either my way or else So it seems women do n't have are not as"
Environment," Optimists take better care of their daily health through beneficial habits . Nutrition exercise , not smoking , not engaged in substance abuse . As this we kind of talked about earlier this afternoon with the extremes , Optimists are better able to regulate their"
No," negative emotions . This we did n't talk about , such as overcoming anger , anxiety , sadness , and this is a very interesting area of positive psychology . It 'S an area where I have been doing research , It 's what strategies the people use to influence their emotions"
No," Some people may think of a happy memory that happened and when they went out with friends and had a good time , let 's say they went out to dinner and they think of that memory , and that puts them into a good mood ."
No," who suffer from anxiety disorders . They are looking at normal people . What do they do to put themselves in a good mood Because it has health consequences , It 's better for your health to be walking around feeling happy than to be feeling black . So it may be that optimists are better able to do this ."
No," They choose strategies , Sometimes people think of funny movies that they have seen - or maybe we talked about this earlier this afternoon - thinking about very romantic movies that make them feel more hopeful about their own relationship ."
No," Okay , and it could be - and this goes back to Adler 's view that optimists have More satisfying social relationships , They have more friends , better friendships , better quality friendships with and closer with family members"
No," and now more and more it 's about . Do you have close friends ? Are you close with your parents ? Do you feel your parents can give you advice versus being an isolated person , So the field is moving much closer to what Adler talked about seventy years ago"
No," that psychological wellbeing psychologically healthy people have good friendships , good social relationships , good family relationships , So being more optimistic helps You to do that again . It helps you to accept the fact you can disagree"
No, with your family members about things and still be close with them . You can compartmentalize does n't mean you will always disagree and pessimistic people are less able to do that . So I think it all comes together when I finished my preparation for this lecture
No," , I felt satisfied because I felt it all does fit together . It all makes sense So in a few minutes that we have , We have about 15 minutes . So we can talk about interventions . We can and do a couple"
No," empirical studies . So the basic idea is , we will start with the first one Think 10 years from now in the future and think about what the best possible scenario would be with your family members . So if you have children"
No," , They will be 10 years older . They wo n't be children anymore . Unless they are infants now They might be teenagers or they might be adults . Your parents will be 10 years older , Siblings . The few siblings will be So write a paragraph about what the ideal situation"
No," would be . So again , let 's do that now . For a couple of minutes , If everything turns out as wonderful as you would hope - and so again the empirical evidence is very strong . This really works and I am starting with family life because I know in Chinese culture"
No," - and I think this is very positive . Family life is a very important value , So I am starting with this deliberately and there are others that will take a quick look at , But we should start with the family . The best possible situation , Best possible scenario that you could picture"
Environment," You could of your salary , that 's important for most people . I think it should be that they are experiencing a good income and again it should be realistic . So we talked about this having realistic optimism"
No," Going beyond that , might be getting to unrealistic optimism . Okay , third , one now very important is health , So that includes mental health . Those of you who have been here all afternoon , you have heard several hours of what positive psychology knows about"
No," ideal psychological functioning and physical health , So describe how you would see your ideal self , mentally and physically Okay again , as they say , if you are still working , you can certainly finish this when we finish today ."
No," Other wives get bored more quickly in the marriage than husbands . Do I am not testing . This is good or bad , but this is the reality , and I have asked my students if they can explain this in terms of evolutionary biology . Why are men more content in a marriage , then women"
No," women get bored more quickly with their husband than men do and as they say , there has been researched with in dating relationships too . So having a lot of hobbies and interests both for men and women is associated with greater psychological wellbeing"
No," , So this would be friendships . Colleagues , if at work , So this is separate from family separate from marriage , is so in ten years so now , what would you like to see is as a quality of your social life"
No," separate from those areas from with your parents or siblings , children and marriage ? So all of these build up your optimism when you do this , they really work just writing down your best possible future"
Environment," this boosts people optimism in a way . It 'S training your mind to think more optimistically , and this is what I have found . Many people are just in a mind , habit of not thinking optimistically either . They think about the worst things that can happen , which you already know by the end of this afternoon"
No," Some psychologists have said : if you wan na dream dream big , It does n't cost you anything more than dreaming . Small Adler never would have gotten to where he did if he dreamed small . As I say , he came from very uninfluential unknown family to become a world leader in his field"
No, Organ Donation After Circulatory Determination of Death: Introduction by Dr. Sally Vitali. Please note that in this video we will be following the guidelines used at Boston Children's Hospital. Some of this information may need to be modified based on the guidelines and practices
No," in place in your institution. This video is part one of a series on the Organ Donation After Circulatory Determination of Death, or DCDD process, at Boston Children's Hospital. My name is Sally Vitali, and I'm a Pediatric Intensivist here at the hospital. In this video, I will introduce the concept of DCDD,"
No," and cover the process of referral, patient eligibility, approach, and consent. There are two pathways to organ donation at the end of a patient's life. The most common pathway since the late 1960s has been donation after neurologic determination of death, or donation after brain death."
No," A more recent option for families is donation after circulatory determination of death, or DCDD, which was previously called donation after cardiac death. Donation after neurologic determination of death occurs following the diagnosis of brain death, which is made using strict clinical criteria."
No," The patient is declared dead, but remains supported by a mechanical ventilator and possibly cardiac medications or ECMO in an intensive care unit. The family is approached for consent, and if they consent, arrangements are made for the body to be taken to the operating room for organ recovery. In DCDD, a family and the medical team"
No," have made a decision together at the end of a child's life that life sustaining treatments, including a ventilator, will be withdrawn. If the patient is medically eligible and likely to die within 60 minutes of discontinuing the ventilator, the family is approached for consent. If they consent, the medical team and the family"
No," will go with the patient to the operating room for the withdrawal of the ventilator and any cardiac support. If the patient progresses to a pulseless arrest within 60 minutes of withdrawing the ventilator, the family will remain in the first operating room. The ICU attending and fellow will take the patient's body"
No," frame for donation, they return to the ICU for continuing endoflife care. Now that you know what DCDD is, you may be wondering which of our patients can potentially become organ donors via the DCDD pathway. Any patient who is mechanically ventilated and whose family and medical team"
No," that decision has been made by a family and the ICU team. If a family inquires about organ donation earlier, we may refer the patient earlier. And the NEOB determines the patient's medical eligibility for organ donation. The NEOB's evaluation for medical eligibility includes several important factors, namely the patient's"
No," Generally speaking, the shorter the warm ischemic time, the healthier the transplanted organ will be. Up to one hour is acceptable for the kidneys, and up to 30 minutes is acceptable for the liver. So what is the best way to talk to families about organ donation? It is common that someone in the patient's family or a family"
No," friend will ask about the option of organ donation before the OPO referral has been made or completed. Our first reaction to them should be the most natural one, which is to acknowledge that even raising this question is tremendously considerate and selfless. If the child is indeed mechanically ventilated and approaching the end of life, we"
No," need to let the family know that we do not know whether the patient is a candidate for organ donation, because we need to ask the New England Organ Bank to evaluate. It's important to notify the patient's ICU attending that the family has asked about organ donation. The attending or their designee should inform the NEOB that the family has inquired."
No," It's also important to avoid speculating with the family about organ donation, or encouraging them to talk about it before the NEOB has been able to evaluate the patient and meet with the family. Families are struggling to make so many different decisions during this difficult time."
No, It's important that they don't reach a premature decision about donation before they have all of the correct information. So how do we introduce the idea of donation to a family that hasn't brought it up? The best way to introduce the subject to a family will depend on the family and the circumstances. Our goal at Boston Children's is to have no unplanned mentions.
No," That is, the introduction of the possibility of organ donation to a family should happen in a planned and deliberate fashion after a collaborative discussion between all members of the ICU team and the NEOB. The introduction should be timed so that the appropriate information resource, namely the NEOB team,"
No," is readily available to meet with the family, whether that be in person or by phone. If the family is interested in proceeding with DCDD, a meeting should be planned to explain the process in detail and obtain informed consent. In preparation for that meeting, members of the ICU team should review the Boston Children's Hospital policies"
No," that they may opt out of participation in DCDD. Some team members may be concerned about the exact definition of death or that any escalation of care for a patient who is at the end of life or prolonging of life to travel to the operating room is not consistent with ideal endoflife care,"
No," even when the family wants the escalation and prolongation to be performed in pursuit of DCDD. Unit leadership will change patient assignments as necessary, and an ethics consult may be called at any time to aid in the discussion of these important issues. The NEOB and Boston Children's Hospital have separate consent"
No," forms, but the issues from both forms can ideally be addressed with the family in one conversation. Most importantly, the family should know that they may change their minds about DCDD at any point, and that no one on the NEOB or ICU team will be upset with them. We will simply proceed with the withdrawal"
No," of lifesustaining treatments in the ICU, as we do for most patients at the end of life. This concludes part one of the video series on DCDD at Boston Children's Hospital. Any questions about this material can be directed to your unit, clinical, or nursing director, or to the Organ Donation Oversight Committee"
No, representatives from your unit. Thank you for taking the time to help improve the quality of our organ donation process at Boston Children's.
No," transplanted tissue , just like your immune system , does to foreign invading pathogens to try and prevent this receivers are given immunosuppressant drugs . This is a tricky balancing act too much drug suppresses the immune system too much and the patient is susceptible"
No," to infections and illnesses . However , too little drugs and the patient risks transplant rejection , as I 'm sure you can imagine . There are some ethical issues surrounding organ transplants that need to be carefully considered , particularly with living donors such as friends or"
No," family , potentially feeling pressured into donations or parents being willing to risk their lives to donate an organ to their child . Even though the operation might not be a success or more shockingly is transplantation tourism if the rich can buy organs off living"
No," In this circumstance, the market system breaks down as the person who wanted the pineapple less has received it. The overall social good is not maximized. Collectively, though, we have decided that perfect is the enemy of good and that a certain level of inequality is ok, especially as, according to some, it motivates people to create more value. Now, inequality in the pineapple market is somewhat unfortunate, but ultimately not a"
No," Strokes are a potential cause of death quite conducive to organ donation as they can often lead to brain death. Now, organs donated in a given region are first offered to those listed in that region—after all, the recipients need to arrive at the hospital in a matter of hours. Therefore, as region 3 has more organs available, the median waiting time for a kidney, and many other organ types, is far shorter here than in region 9. Interestingly, the rules in the US do allow those that need a transplant to list themselves"
Environment," Tennessee is also considered as part of the stroke belt, and therefore the transplant region it is in, 11, has shorter wait times. Of course, wealthier people, such as Steve Jobs, are able to do things like fly in a private jet to get to the transplant hospital in time, and he even bought a house in Memphis to stay in during his recovery. It’s no wonder why there is such a strong positive correlation between patients listing in multiple regions and income levels."
No," So, the current system is not perfectly ethical, and it also potentially exacerbates the shortage, so that has led some people to ask, what if we just used a normal economic market for organ allocation? That is what happened in Iran. Previously, the waiting list for kidneys in the country exceeded that of almost any other nation due to political instability and cultural stigma against organ donation. However, in 1988, they implemented a system where recipients could pay donors for their"
No," organs. Typically, the donor receives a fee of around $4,500, equivalent to more than half a year’s salary, in addition to free health insurance for a year. Now, this isn’t a truly free market—it is highly regulated and managed—but reports indicate that it has had some success at solving the scarcity problem. In the years after this program was implemented, organ donations skyrocketed and, apparently, there is no longer any waiting list in the country."
No," christy simpson , and their seminar is entitled ethical and legal issues with respect to a brainbased definition of death from an organ donation perspective . Before i introduce today 's speakers , i 'd like to let you know that the"
No," mental health law and studies issues arising at the intersection of biomedical sciences , technologies , ethics and the law . Christy simpson is an associate professor and head of the department of bioethics at dalhousie university ."
No," What is the definition and determination project and that 's sort of the short form of the title . But really , if you hear us refer to ddd project , that 's actually the same thing , and it is a brain based"
No, focused in terms of the definition of death and determination and you 'll hear a little bit more about that a little bit later on . In terms of the . Why what and how of that project itself ? Jen will then provide some further legal
No," and then to specify criteria for the determination of death , and the distinction here would be . For example , death might be defined as the irreversible cessation of all brain function , whereas criteria for its determination"
No," might be the kinds of tests and readings and criteria that would allow one to determine that the definition is satisfied , and so the project has both of those things . In its view , to try to come up with an agreed"
No," consensus , definition and then criteria for determination of death , and why uh this unified brain based approach , um , i i suppose it it reflects a the idea that"
No, technological changes and one of them is the use of what 's called normothermic regional perfusion . In the context of organ donation - and this would be the reresumption after cardiac cardiorespiratory arrest of
No," circulation , um , usually with the clamping of arteries to the brain , to try to avoid blood flow to the brain but recirculation within the rest of the body . The cardiorespiratory function . And so , if this is being done , um , what does it ?"
No," under that rubric of organ donation and thinking about it most significantly in terms of the dead donor rule , for example , and wanting to be absolutely sure somebody is dead prior to doing organ donation ? Obviously , that 's of much much importance"
No, There 'S the circulatory determination of death group - that 's looking at it from that sense of and recognizing that there 's been a historical perspective on having cardiac or a lack of circulation being that sort of focus of
No," this context , and so very , as you can see very focused on particular types of evidence , particular types of questions that relate to clinical practice and are very real . I think both for families"
No," where 's the public on this ? What does the public understand about death in the context of organ donation ? Where are professionals at both in the healthcare context , but also we 're broadly thinking from a legal and ethical perspective"
No," where there are communities as well , and how will that understanding that , from that stakeholder engagement , perspective , facilitate things like knowledge , translation and another way of putting ? It is well what would be what 's important for the"
No," it is in essence delegated to medical community to determine what death is define it as well as to specify what are the criteria going to be to allow us to determine That that definition has been met , what are"
No, bunch of others that might happen upstream of that um or downstream of that . So let me give a quick overview of the kinds of legal disputes and this is important uh . When thinking about trying to come up with a consensus definition .
No, question of well what kinds of tests are required ? What forms of ancillary testing should be done to help a family to accept the definition or for practitioners to be entirely certain
No," determined according to acceptable medical criteria . That determination of death is invalid , because there are no accepted medical criteria and any diagnosis is therefore legally suspect . That 'S one form of argument . Another one distinct but of the same kind of level"
No, states in a number of cases - that a family who objects to the brainbased definition of Death will fight that case um at the upstream stage by refusing to consent to brain death testing . So since uh consent is
No," , you can hear those resonances of . Ah , this is where the ethics issues start to fit into about . Well , how do we begin to think through some of the issues that might arise in the end of life context in the organ donation context"
No," from a medical perspective . For example , right that there can be those kinds of questions , and so in this sense , then i really want to be clear that from the epic side we move into this conversation about thinking of brain death and the types of"
No," criteria and the types of tests that Are being used , mindful of these are highly emotional contacts . Sometimes it 's highly emotional conversations with families . It can be difficult for physicians and clinicians to engage in this space as"
No," well , and so it 's it 's being mindful of both the conversations that go really well and the understanding that death has occurred . That may then lead to organ donation and recognizing that often will happen"
No," and what that means for those families or the family . Members that are uh have participated in that process and understand it yeah what has happened , but also what happens when there 's tension or conflict ? What happens about how that is resolved"
No," So in that context , then we 're still thinking about well , what are the relevant values and principles and how do they help us characterize frame , identify address some of the different issues that arise"
No," from that ethical , legal kind of lens on what we 're talking about in terms of This project , so things like , and the values of respect for persons . What does that fundamentally mean in this context"
No," as much as there 's a claim towards a brainbased definition of death ? Well , what does that mean in the context of respect for equity , diversity and inclusion and understanding in a pluralistic community in a pluralistic country ?"
No," How do we reconcile some of those tensions at a systems level , as well as at the bedside , when these conversations arise , so that question of autonomy and reform choices about whether consent is needed becomes very significant"
No," maintained that sense of integrity , but also very much wanting to deliver patients and family centered care and Needing to look to , how do we trace out some of the issues that arise and see what 's going on from a justice or a"
No," fairness perspective ? What 'S fair as we wrestle with what is or is not done within a publicly funded healthcare system , for example , how do we think about maintaining trust in the organ donation process in light of disagreements in light of"
No," stakeholder group was going to be looking at will become so critical as well about ? How do we talk about this ? How do we encourage those conversations writ large , but also in these particular contexts where we 're thinking about"
No," organ donation and whether death has occurred in this kind of way ? So i think , between both of our sets of slides around the context , you 'll start to see where we 're out of all of the interesting"
No," will end at this point and it the mckitty versus hyanni trial level decision was a really good example of this , because one of the one Of the arguments that was made when the mckitty family challenged brain death"
No," you 're not brain dead but um , it will certainly be The case that there 's no claim to continued medical care um , it 's important to the family as well . Many cultural and religious practices hinge upon the distinction between death"
No," from both the ethics and the legal perspectives . In terms of the two ways we can start to think about uh groupings of work that we might be looking at , and one is really thinking about it from that perspective of"
No," , and so working with the pros and cons and thinking through some of these aspects are a relevant way to help advance . The conversation around , what are we meaning by death in this particular context , and what does it look like , while not taking on the broader claim of"
No," um , and we need to know whether those are going to be construed as functions or not . That will affect whether someone 's dead or not another ass word , which has has caused a lot of grief"
No," has been achieved so um , for example , we might , as i say , be able to resuscitate organs , but another thing is : we might actually learn more about um ongoing pieces of function . I i was thinking also"
No," All of those aspects will be really helpful because that then provides you with a pathway for thinking through that aspect of a dispute or a disagreement , but also recognizing that broader context around . What do"
No," if we disagree about what we 're what we 're talking about and so wanting to look at that really closely - and i think a piece of that that we have n't quite touched on yet - is to be thinking about this and as we 're looking at it , both from the"
No," Definition and determination of death itself , but also thinking about organ donation . We are mindful that this is in the context of neonatal pediatric and adult settings , so the project is looking at that and all the groups are thinking about this"
No," from those different practice contexts , and so i think for myself , as i reflect on some of ethics consultations , That have arisen at the end of life , sometimes where questions of organ donation arise . How intimately connected questions are"
No," of ? Am i being a good spouse or partner ? Am i being a good parent to contemplate ? Not only maybe accepting that somebody has died and trusting my health care providers when they tell me my loved one has died , but also then to go . Am i comfortable"
No," saying yes to organ donation or what knowing things have changed in our country too around that from a presumed or deemed consent perspective needing to think about those aspects , but fundamentally also wanting to go . Are the relevant considerations in the"
No," families in the public , how do you think that this may influence public trust ? It seems possible that the public may be immediately distrustful of any new definitions and descriptions of death ."
No," for thinking . Through how do we talk about this and how do we set it up just in the way that jen was talking about uh and sort of more generally as well ? Thank you , okay , and i see that there was a congratulatory comment from matthew"
No, machines and medications . Supporting cardio respiratory function before or after organ donation without conflict could conflict resolution about brain death look differently depending on whether organ
No," about brain death look differently depending on whether organ donation is proceeding or not yeah ? No , i think it 's to me . It 'S a really interesting question because most of me says no , it 's probably going"
No," , so i think it 's more being mindful . There might be particular aspects that are being raised or that are coming may be brought into the conversation or dispute if you 're thinking about organ donation , whether that 's on the family side or"
No," pressure , maybe on the family to accept us is because it 's about work and donation right . We want to be clear that this is um two different types of things that we 're talking about , even though they 're interconnected , so"
No," wanting to carve out that space and be clear around . Let 'S talk about the death piece , let 's look at the determination for that and then , if and when we know somebody said , then that 's where the question about organ donation may arise"
No," and there may be other disputes or questions that are very specific to organ donation itself . That may have nothing to do with the question of whether somebody is brain dead or not , and the family accepts that writer has met that definition of death ."
No," So i think yeah , it 's a helpful question that we 'll sort of keep track of that one to be thinking through , but that would be my first pass on it . Wonderful , thank you . Okay um the next question , and there are a nice little list of questions coming"
No," of the discussion , others will allow sort of a 24 or 48 hour delay before removal of ventilation , for example , um . So it 's an accommodation just a little bit of time instead , which i think some families might say is"
No," , where someone 's brain dead , rather than forcing the issue , it is to not basically say there should be no escalation of treatment and and that that eventually someone who 's brain dead would deteriorate To satisfy"
No," cardiorespiratory criteria as well , i guess another question which appears occurs to me is beyond nonescalation of treatment . Could one just stop not renew treatment on the theory that it 's futile so not argue whether"
No," someone 's dead or not but say we 're not providing medically futile treatment ? Now , in a way , this converts the dispute into a dispute over the meaning of futility , of course , but it is not requiring agreement on the metaphysical position"
No," actually is . I think a really nice question , based on what you were just speaking about jennifer , which is from lana elliott , who says that historically , just historically determination of brain death has been associated with organ"
No," critical care and knowing that fundamentally connects to things like organ donation . But for me , part of the the connection between the previous connect question and this one is also that broader"
No," sort of ongoing tension that i think we have any time when we 're talking about publicly funded healthcare , which is what 's at sort of the broader public level about Where they want resources allocated or we want resources allocated"
No," family centered care , which Is a call to how have we set up health care in ways that marginalize folks or or exclude some folks and make access easier for others to those resources , while not also saying patient first"
No, about there 's different approaches that we could be taking to handle . Some of the disputes also have really interesting resource implications as well . That are really great to be thinking
No," through around . Is this a better way to group some of the particular value considerations together and address those in a way that says ? Yes , that 's where we want to put our resources"
No," , meaning not just the the types of care , but also our resources in terms of our emotional energy and our types of discussion that we 're having in those things as well , so for yeah . Both of these questions are really encouraging me to think more about"
No," okay with it sure okay , so this question comes from nicholas murphy , who says if the aim is to offer a biomedical view of death , as opposed to a metaphysical view ? Will the clarification or potential legislative harmonization"
No," sought by the ddd project do anything to force all challenges to neurological death determination on , for example , religious grounds , um , probably not um ? I think it would not"
No," About 95 percent of Americans support organ donation, but less than half sign up to be a donor… what’s up with that? Hello conscious collection of organs, Jules here for DNews. No one knows exactly why people refuse to be organ donors. Organ donation is a tricky subject, and super individual. According to one study most people gathered information on organ donation by watching"
No," scientifically inaccurate shows like Grey’s Anatomy. Another study backed up that data, showing more than half of people learned what they know about donation from television, and another 12 percent from their friends; unsurprisingly, 72 percent of people were afraid organ donation. So, let’s burst this Anatomically Grey bubble and talk about what actually happens during organ donation. First, if a patient enters a hospital, literally no one is thinking about whether or not they"
No," by the brain stem. They’ll shine a light into the pupil, scratch the back of the throat, poke to cause minor pain, and put water in the ear canal trying to get eye reactions. If there’s no response they’re disconnected from the ventilator to see if they have a “respiratory drive,” or if they want to breathe. If they react to none of these, doctors decide their brain stem isn’t controlling their body, and they’re considered brain dead."
No," The ventilator is turned back on, and the family is informed. The doctors then check donor rolls, and discuss final wishes with the family. If the person’s wish is for organ donation, then they look for organ and tissue matches! The heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, intestines, skin, bone tissue, corneas, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels can all be transplanted that may sound like a lot, but that still leaves a lot behind. The doctors take as much care with deceased donors as they do with living humans, taking"
Environment," the donor to a sterilized operating room like any other. An anesthesiologists monitors fluids and body conditions while surgeons remove organs and tissues that can be used, inspect them for any unknown disease or damage. They then cool them for transport to the donee. Once the organs are safely removed, the person is closed like any surgery, the ventilator is shut off. The body is cleaned, hair is washed, and the body is returned to the family."
No," Really quickly, there are a lot of myths out there about this process. Donors can have an open casket funeral, no problem, organ donation is performed just like any surgery. Doctors will absolutely work as hard as possible to save your life if you come in no matter how many desirable looking organs you may have. And finally, no matter how old you are, your organs can be helpful. Organ donation is tough for people."
No," A breathing, body with a heartbeat is difficult for many family members to accept as a cadaver, and even if you sign up to be a donor, and die in a way suitable for donation, your family can sometimes override that wish. That said, only 3 in 1000 people die in such a way that allows for donation. They have to be generally healthy, without viral infection, and must die in a hospital setting! Over 119,000 children, women and men are on the waiting list for organ donation, and 22"

Environment," interest is in health promotion . You could say that my job is to change the way people think about their health . What did they 'll work in bulk on any given day ? I could be handling resident inquiries , providing training and safe food handling , carrying out food premises"
No," , inspections discussing with architects the health requirements for a proposed restaurant or ensuring compliance with the Food Standards code , so that customers know exactly what they 're getting my work is largely projectbased identify Need in the community , and if I"
Environment," waterways are being overstressed looking out for toxic algal blooms and harmful bacteria and assessing caravan parks . In fact , the further you get away from the metropolitan area , the more diverse the job becomes , it 's my job to ensure their health and safety ."
No," responsible for more deaths worldwide than all the dangerous animals combined . Luckily , in Australia , potentially fatal diseases such as dengue fever are not common . However , the Ross River virus carried by many mosquitoes is definitely no fun and"
Environment," the information to them . That 'S it all over . What 'S next a TV appointment for a counselor improvement project . Now , first , here 's the city of Millville who are leading the way in the fight against air pollution . So if people have problems with the smoke , even infiltrating the"
Environment," house is the washing and it basically we are . We struggle to do anything about it . Someone who 's interested in science , health and the environment being comfortable with meeting and talking to people is also useful . You have to be a critical thinker . Sometimes the answer is"
No, Then I saw a speaker from environmental health and thought . Wow that sounds really good at high school . I did n't know what I wanted to do . My dad worked in local government and arranged for me to do work experience an environmental help . I was struck by how much there was to
No," the job . So here I am thanks . Dad for sure their toilet is not that great , but then in the next instant something happens to this lift , I definitely the job it 's fantastic . I work with a great team and have the opportunity to actually make different"
No, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and in partnership with the gell Institute . Today 'S webinar builds on our first webinar about urban planning for non urban designers . This webinar will employ three case studies to demonstrate community engagement strategies in
No, successful and innovative urban design projects . So speakers from kaboom archive global and Friends of Bushwick Inlet park will share their experiences advocating at the community level and promoting communal ownership and action . Participants will learn about realworld
No," examples of urban design and in relation to health equity , as well as gain an understanding of community engagement in various settings and across various determinants of health . So briefly , the health equity initiative is a member driven nonprofit organization dedicated"
No," to building and sustaining a global community that engages across sectors and disciplines to advance health equity membership benefits include shaping health equity conversations such as these and webinar and event formats as well , social forums , Individual membership"
Environment," , let 's define health equity ? Briefly , one definition is providing every individual the same opportunity to stay healthy and cope with a condition , regardless of socioeconomic conditions , race , gender age , social status , living and working environments and other socially"
No," determined factors . Our speakers will describe how their urban design projects were successful . Using community engagement and tie in the impact of health equity , the focus will be on housing with Sarah from archive global playgrounds with Aisha , kaboom and green"
Environment," University , which focused on fear , epidemics , Public Health Policy , planning and architecture archive stands for architecture for health and vulnerable environments , we use the basic right of housing , deliver the basic need of Health , we believe that health should not be"
No," negatively impacted by the state of housing and that by prioritizing housing design at the key intersection between development , health and architecture , we can combat disease around the world . In light of the growing problem of drug resistance and the high cost of medicine"
Environment," each of our projects , although different based on site , particularity , cultural specificities and particular expected outcomes , will have three components : research , awareness and a tide of the built environment , Habitat for Humanity , estimates that as many as 16"
Environment," stable , durable and safe , and legal access to property identified here . As security of tenure for vulnerable populations , who often spend a majority of the day in their homes , each of these components has the capacity to have a significant impact on"
Environment," their health . In short , this is a context within which archived global seeks to operate at the intersection between the built environment and public health . Just as the urban environment , it has a capacity to provide access to clean drinking water parks and transportation"
No," infectious diseases such as respiratory infections , waterborne diseases , vector borne diseases , rodent borne infections , intestinal worms And diarrhea , as well as chronic diseases such as asthma , cardiovascular diseases , diabetes and cancers . However , the public realm is not"
Environment," , which can cause asthma and other respiratory illnesses , poor floor wall and roof construction can host parasites or insects , causing things like dengue fever or Chagas , and direct contact with wastewater Or unhygenic environments , where food storage can cause problems"
No, The common thread among our project is a community engagement focus . Our work is located all over the world and we believe in the vitality and the strength of the community ecosystems into which we propose our interventions . So our intent is to leave a smaller footprint
No," at the end of the project as possible . While having made a large impact on the quality of life , that 's inhabit , we can only do that with a robust community engagement strategy which begins with a search for an appropriate local partner , one who 's well connected"
No," to the community . Do you intend to work with , as well as having experienced locally with the issues we seek to address together ? We approach the community to find trusted leaders and work together to develop a list of appropriate beneficiaries , create"
Environment," training material that will be culturally sensitive and locally appropriate . As well as identify any larger campaign opportunities or relevant skills that can be taught to the local tradesmen at the completion of a project , the community as a whole has a"
No," better understanding of how to keep their families healthier , whether through an understanding of best practices . To avoid the problem or with the addition of an architectural intervention which targets some of the most vulnerable families in the community and have"
No," measurable impacts , local tradesmen are trained to be able to implement additional requests for household interventions or make repairs on these . In the long term , community leaders and health workers remain as trusted resources , as previously mentioned . We"
No," would like to present two examples of community engagement efforts in our projects . The project in London UK spent from 2013 to 2016 and was developed to combat tuberculosis . The incidence of tuberculosis has doubled in London over the last 20 years , making it the TV"
No," and isolated community have been hampered by the high prevalence of TB risk factors such as poorly ventilated , damp and overcrowded housing conditions . The overall strategy consisted in increasing awareness about the basics of TB transmission and its relationship to"
Environment," living conditions through a televised campaign and training since secondary schools . Here on the screen , you can see some of the secondary school initiatives that we did at a local school trip . At a local school 540 children participated in"
No," workshop to understand the housing conditions that might cause her aggravate tuberculosis in its transmission , symptoms of the disease and the extensive treatment . The expectation was that they would take this information into their families"
No," , homes and communities and Tommy that we also had 30 community health workers were trained to be able to identify housing conditions that increase risk of transmission and , over time continue to increase awareness throughout the community And be a local resource for"
No," information . Finally , there was also an audience of 30,000 people who are provided with messages about prevention , symptoms and places to receive treatment . This group was reached through televised and radio campaigns three years into the campaign . The reported incidence of"
Environment, tuberculosis to the National Health Service had decreased by 20 % . A similar project by archived Global was also executed in Camden New Jersey for asthma prevention . The London Project was really an exercise in having high impact or the least amount of cost to integrate
Environment," household interventions directly into the built environment . We did the project In yaounde , cameroon , which spanned from 2013 to 2016 and was developed to combat malaria , which in cameroon is responsible for 50 % of deaths of children under 5 , malaria is transmitted by mosquitos"
No," between 10:00 pm and 4:00 am so . Our principal mission was to install screens on windows , doors and eaves to seal the house from mosquito penetration at night . Our original goal was to reduce the density of mosquitoes found indoors by 20 % for 320 homes . The community . The"
Environment," outreach on this project took multiple forms . More than 5,000 direct beneficiaries were provided with training on the symptoms , causes and treatment of malaria , as well as preventive measures , including the installation of screens in windows , doors"
No," television and through the radio to inform them . Symptoms causes and treatment of malaria , as well as best practices and preventative measures . A hunny 25 community board organization representatives were trained to continue"
No," begin to demonstrate the importance of a robust community engagement strategy that helps to ensure The longterm success of our projects worldwide for more information . Please visit our website where you can find additional information on our projects , blog posts"
No," with informational articles or a Facebook page , where you can find a variety of events , we 're also on Twitter at our head global . Thank you . Thank you . Sarah wonderful presentation . Our next speaker is Ayesha Alexander , the director of community initiatives for kaboom ."
Environment," environment through the eyes of kids and families living with limited resources before joining kaboom Ayesha held positions , creating the strategic vision and implementation plans for youth and community serving organizations most recently serving"
Environment," the director Of operations for the city of Charlotte 's Department of Neighborhood and Economic Development , she attended Hampton University where she earned her BA in English and early childhood education in Temple , University earning a master of social work"
Environment," , concentrating in the community and policy practice beyond our responsibilities with kaboom . Aisha spends much of her time working on issues of civil rights and education and criminal justice reform , she 's working with groups like the dream defenders to"
No," organize youth to change the trajectory of their communities , making Aisha the presenter now . Okay . Thank you . So much for having me excited to speak with you all about the work that we do here at kaboom , so as a boom . We believe that the wellbeing of our community starts with"
Environment," the wellbeing of our kids and that play is critical to their belief , Drive . We are the only national organization in the United States that is focused solely on creating play spaces and underresourced movies . So we really believe that the built environment is the value that we"
Environment," place on . People poured in a concrete . What you see in the both environment really tells people how their city feels about them , values them and where infrastructure is broken . Oftentimes people also feel broken . So where would you want your kids to play into very"
Environment," closely located playgrounds , one in Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York that serves higher income residents and another is in Bayview public housing , which is a New York City , public housing development ? And so , if you look at these two pictures , you know where would you"
No," want your kids to play and then , more importantly , what do those playgrounds ? Oh , the kids , that live in each community . So we really look at clay as an equity issue . Kids and poverty are missing out on the chance to play all across the country across the us , especially in"
No," cities too many kids and miss out on the chance to play because of where they live , where they come from or how much their families earn . For the 15 million kids living in poverty in our country , that 's one out of every five play is too hard to come by , as their families"
No," struggle to make ends meet . Lowincome families face many structural obstacles to play like the lack of safe play spaces . The decline in recess and then poor infrastructure to get them to save green spaces where they can , they are able to play , and this has really great"
No," their health as well . So only one out of four kids are getting that recommended 60 minutes of physical activity and active play every day and the numbers are even worse when you 're thinking about kids living in lowincome communities , where those structural"
Environment," barriers exist and we 're concerns around safety , make it harder For kids to play , so the benefits of play are actually very real , very measurable , and I know I do n't have to say this , but people take for granted . How important play is the work of children and by missing out of"
No," it out of play , they 're really missing . The opportunity to develop their minds so develop those critical thinking , skills , develop creativity , improves , reading levels and increases the likelihood of kids attending college certainly reduces the risk of chronic"
No," underresourced communities in the past 21 years and we rallied people the entire community around a cause that everyone can get behind . The wellbeing , kids and there 's a very tangible project of a play space in the communities that we 've worked in so often they have been"
No," gives them a very tangible , like at the end of the day , you can actually actually touch and Feel this playground that is going to improve the health and wellbeing of your kids , but we do n't swoop in and just build a playground . We engaged community members as a key part"
No," of the solution , so they are actually ones that are putting together this entire playground project uniting their community around the project , we 're just the facilitators and provide them with the tools that are necessary , but they are the ones that Are"
No," actually taking ownership from day one which is so important I 'll talk about a little bit more in the end , we end it would be safe spaces for kids and families , so the community helps to build this playground . That becomes what we 've heard over and over again hallowed"
No," ground for that community , where it is a safe space where the community can unite and take responsibility for their health and wellbeing . So our community build model every play space that we built with the assistance"
No," from kaboom is utilizes . Our ABCD community build model so asset based Community Development , based on the belief that all of the answers to the community to the community 's issues are within that community . So we involve broadbased community support around the"
No," planning and building of these play spaces from day one . So , let 's talk a little bit about what that looks like anytime , we go into a community to build a playground . We start off with the kids . Their voices are most important . They are our little planners they 're our play"
No," caregivers and the community associations . So in our process , they are the leaders of this project , as I said , we 're just providing them with the tools and helping them to facilitate this process . So they are stepping up people that did n't think that they could they"
No," , but neither one of those people are the expert about their community . So in this room they 're the experts , they are the leaders and they 're given that opportunity to shine and home their leadership skills . So we go through a asset based Community Development"
No," mapping , asset mapping process to figure out who in a community can help us build these playgrounds , and we rely completely on the parents and caregivers and other community members to really think through to make this project happen . Who do you know and once we get into this"
No," and really loves to come out and do volunteer projects , and they also know how to sew , and so maybe they could put something Together that could be really neat for the for the project and your your cousin is a DJ , there 's all sorts of knowledge within these communities and"
No," , if they 're , never getting that opportunity to unearth them from the gifts of individuals to what associations and institutions . Are you aware of then it may never surface , but our process really gives them the ability to do that . So community members"
No," come together on a planning committee and they go through a six to eight week process to really put together this playground building initiative . So there 's a play committee , and this is all parents or caregivers people that live in the neighborhood where we 're voting a"
No, playground . So they work with kids to develop a plan for the kids to be able to play and have some different activities on the build days . There 'S a recruitment team that will recruit over 200 volunteers that are actually from the community and come out and build the
No," raise it and they always do and you would think okay . These are underresourced communities , but they are able to pull this together . The food team will secure breakfast and lunch for all 200 of those volunteers . The ena may go out and pound the pavement and get lots"
No," benches and all sorts of community beautifying resources , a mural - and it 's really - the community coming together working again hand in hand that picture at the top left that grandparent support . That group came together through this process , so they were grandmothers who"
No," grandparent support , and now they are volunteering in that elementary school every single day . So what we know is our process really works , and so , after our playground project , we see that people in the community see an increase believe that their community they can make it"
Environment," individually . We see an increased belief that they have a shared sense . A commitment to address community issues and from community health to violence safety , reading levels , everything in between we 've had people that have gone on that live in public housing complexes"
No," that will go on and say our interests are not being represented and guess what I 'm running for Office and have run for alderman or another another position that their potential was realized through this community engagement process , and we also have"
No, increased belief that their community members are n't there just port nuts one another . We did 16 playground builds in Baltimore in the wake of the death of Freddie gray and the civil unrest that happened there . So one of my proudest moment seeing the surveys from the youth
No," that were involved in the project and saying that , because of their involvement in the kaboom playground bill , they now believe they 're adults in their community that care about them and their wellbeing . And they also now that feel that they have a person that they can"
No," turn to and talk to and times of stress . So that is a tremendous public health benefit . When you think about there 's a proverb that says , welcome children in your city or they will burn it down to fill it . It 'S warm and we are repurposing that that burn it down mentality with"
No, this positive activity that everyone can rally around . But in the process they are coming to death together as a community to increase increase their quality of life . So I 'm processing those improved community relations and attitudes and
No, providing that safe haven again that hallowed ground for kids and families where they are able to improve their lives . The benefits there are immeasurable and we 're really proud of what we 've been able to do across the past 21 years and continue to do to
No," and shared interests and goals to improve the quality of life for all , she moved to Greenpoint in 1996 , with two small children and then back . Then there was no local family soccer program in the neighborhood parks , so in 1999 she helped found the a yso Greenpoint"
No," Williamsburg youth soccer league and was the assistant commissioner for 12 years , and this led to her involvement with the public parks advocacy as there were many Safe soccer fields for kids to play on , and so speaking to ayisha 's point and in 2014 she became the coleader of friends"
No," know our friends , the bush like in the park . It 'S an allvolunteer organization , it 's about our engagement with the city during the process of rezoning that started in 2005 , so that so what happened was 2005 Davies owned the whole waterfront in Greenpoint in Williamsburg"
No," with very toxic coal tar , and we had very degraded on neighborhood , not to mention that we were also home to waste transfer stations To a treatment plants we had radiactive terrible industry for legacy that very much poisoned our neighborhood . We have a 17 million gallon oil spill"
No," people were making a lot of money , lots of families and longterm residents were being displaced because of you know the increased housing cost . You know rents were starting to skyrocket , so in 2015 , which was about a decade later , the city had only acquired 16 . You know the 27"
No," that as if he 's owned , his property , which was manufacturing and it 's kept a little wonky . But if it got Riis owned as residential , then it would be worth like 2 or 3 times the amount . So he was thinking it was worth a half a billion dollars which"
No," just seemed untenable , so we jumped into action and it - and this is sort of a toolbox of what we did . We we , we were relentless activist and everything we did . It required community engagement and we built a whole coalition of supporters . So in our neighborhood we already had a"
Environment, lot of people and organizations that were involved with the environment and stuff like that . So we brought that man . We'Ve got all the schools involved and we sort of a list if you tally it out . We ended up having six rallies with all our elected officials and we had eight major
No," we sort of reached out and , and they kind of built their own coalition to help us and during part of our advocacy . You know - and this is all a lot of learning for me - I got involved with the community board and we had them . They wrote a resolution declaring that there would never be any"
No," So all the elected officials declared that they would never support a rezoning and , along with their community board , and then Mayor DeBlasio , made a declaration that he would never go against the the Bushwick Inlet park and against the local council , member and other elected"
No," reasonings from other industrial zone neighborhoods like East New York . So we made it our mission to go to all these community boards and tell people about the broken promises . The baton switch . Where you know community is offered , you know , promise great rezoning , new"
Environment," oysters , are they 're kind of create their own infrastructure under the water , and this is all about so building natural infrastructure for resiliency . As we are facing climate change - and they also are amazing , cleansers of the water , so we 've got our own little . We'Ve got four cages"
No, of oysters that they 've just been planted and we are working with a local middle school and that requires that the that the teachers get trained and the children get trained and it 's an amazing organization . So we partnering up with them and then we can only access this by
Environment," Newtown Creek Alliance , which is an ecological . You know watchdog for the Newtown Creek and it 's big on education . So we are starting our partnerships with you know , to sort of build out where we can and right now we 're super excited , because you can see this picture of a"
No," come up with a scheme that will allow public engagement . We'Re start thinking about agricultural engagement , landscape , literacy , learning about plants and the history of resilient plants and indigenous species , and and we 're building on this idea of building kind"
Environment," they 've terrible pollution because of the BQE that runs through it , and so there 's a neat initiative that we are very actively involved with supporting um , which is called the BQ green . And it 's the idea of trying to connect the two sides of Williamsburg that were divided"
No," move into the question and answer session and to kick us off I 'll start off with a question that was prepared . So when you compare your efforts and successes to other organizations , how is your approach to community engagement been a differentiator or a key success"
No," factor , and maybe I can direct that one first to Aisha and and then maybe over to to Kathryn and Sarah . So you should you have the mic , so I think the key way that our community engagement process is different is in how we engage kids and we do n't build things for kids . We build"
No," what those things are and it 's different for every community , and so engaging them in the process is critical . Wonderful , thank you , and that might be a little bit more tricky for for Sarah , but is , is that the case in the housing space as well ? Well , I think that you know"
Environment," our environment is starting to even get a little bit crowded , which is wonderful . I mean we have the UN focusing on on housing issues and a lot of organizations starting to get on board . So we think that that 's great one thing that is tricky and I do n't"
No," to have buyin from the community , and so we look for local partners , but we also have to get down beyond the local partner to really people who are engaged in the community every single day and who are walking . You know the streets as a everyone . We want to participate in the"
No," program , so that 's where our big focus is , and it 's something that we 're continuously learning from every project is slightly different . Every project has cultural specificities , but the more we dig into it . We realized that the key component and the key driver of making"
No, these projects have you know long term . Sustainability is really that that partnership that we can make locally and then even further at the community level . Thank you thank you and Katherine . Is there a differentiator between what Bushwick and let park has done and and
No," said - relentless activism and Now we are facing , you know more incremental and building out and are also exactly doing that trying to engage our community and learning about how to do that and the and the and over , in the south side , with the"
Environment," grassroots ontheground effort to education , and this is throughout Puente , Which is an academy and uh , so environmental justice organization over there , and they have two components , say the green light district , which is actually engaging the neighbors and the"
Environment, students and school to measure and measure like the particulates in the air and the parks and they 're engaging Them scientifically and and then there 's another group called mothers out front so they 're getting the moms involved with and starting the you know . Education
Environment," fantastic job of being able to share how they 've been improving the physical environment , to advance health equity by leveraging the community And engaging them , I thank all the registrants . There are over a hundred registrants for this . This webinar supported by the Robert"
No, webinar in the series September 13th . It will also be about the strategies for urban designers to engage local communities and really appreciate you being a part of this and and sharing the the awareness for health equity in your organization 's . Thank you very much and
No, have a great rest of the afternoon uncle
Environment," for sleep, mood, learning, nutrition, exercise of various kinds, strength and endurance, and hypertrophy, and we are going to talk about some protocols that relate to creativity. We're going to talk about behavioral protocols, supplement based protocols,"
No," We've talked about chemical sensing. And we had a guest episode that covered a lot of information about new and emerging technologies in neuroscience, as well as mental health. That was the interview episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth. So given that we've covered so much detailed information"
Environment," and structure to the way that we will address these questions, I've arranged the science and sciencebased protocols that relate to various aspects of life such as mood, exercise, sleep, waking, anxiety, creativity, et cetera into the context of a day."
No," is not just a practical one, but it's one that's related to our deeper biology. You may have heard in my interview episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself, in order to juggle a tremendous workload, a fulltime clinical practice, a lab of 40 plus people, a family of five children, et cetera,"
Environment," with whatever environment you're in. So that's absolutely terrific. Another thing about ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses is that their aesthetic is really terrific. You know, I don't think I'm alone in saying that many performance glasses as they're called end up making people look like a cyborg,"
Environment," metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera, but you don't know what to do with that information. With InsideTracker, they have this terrific dashboard that allows you to both see your levels of hormones, metabolic factors, and the rest, but also, it suggests specific things that you can do with your nutrition, your exercise, and lifestyle,"
No," you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman. And if you do that, you'll get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Just use the code HUBERMAN at checkout. That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 25% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep."
No," Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are ideally matched your sleep needs. I started sleeping on a Helix mattress about eight months ago, and I can honestly say it's the best sleep that I've ever had in my entire life. And that's because the mattress"
No," was actually designed for me. And you can have a mattress designed for you. If you go to helixsleep.com, they have this free, very brief, twominute quiz that asks you a number of questions like do you sleep on your side or your back? Do you tend to run warm while you sleep"
No," or do you tend to get cold in the middle of the night? Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions, and that's fine too. After taking that quiz, they will match you to a specific mattress that's ideal for your sleep needs. I matched to the socalled ""Dusk Mattress,"""
No," DUSK, because I wanted a mattress that was not too firm, not too soft. As I mentioned, I absolutely love it. If you're interested in upgrading your mattress, you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman, take their twominute sleep quiz, and they'll match you to a customized mattress"
No," peerreviewed science to your day and how to optimize everything from sleep to learning, creativity, meal timing, et cetera. As I mentioned earlier, I'm going to do this in the context of my day and what I typically do. However, the specific protocols"
Environment," for any number of different things, sleep, relaxation, meal timing, exercise, et cetera, any one or all of those could be rearranged to suit your specific needs. I'm going to tell you what I do from morning until waking and even what I do while I sleep in order to optimize my sleep."
No," So let's start with getting up in the morning. Now, for me, I tend to wake up sometime around 6:00 AM, 6:30, sometimes as late as 7:00 AM. I don't typically sleep much later than 7:00 AM. The first thing I do after I wake up is I take the pen that's on my nightstand and the pad of paper on my nightstand"
No," and I write down the time in which I woke up. Now, I do sleep with my phone in my room. I realized this is considered a sin and has certain hazards associated with it, but I put my phone on airplane mode about an hour before I go to sleep. And then I set my alarm typically for 6:30 AM."
No," That average wake up time informs what's called my ""temperature minimum."" It tells me when my body temperature was lowest. The temperature minimum is the time in each 24hour cycle that your body temperature is lowest. I don't sleep with a thermometer in my mouth or elsewhere, and I don't think you should either."
No," shifting your circadian sleep schedule and wake schedule. Also for shifting your eating schedule, et cetera, We will return to that. But even if you don't travel, even if you don't care about things like jet lag, even if you sleep fabulously all year round, never have a poor night's sleep,"
No," The effect it has is essentially to quiet or reduce the amount of neural activity in this brain structure called the ""amygdala."" Amygdala means ""almond,"" and many of you have probably heard about the amygdala for its role in anxiety and fear and threat detection. And indeed, the amygdala is part of the network"
No," in the brain that generates feelings of fear and threat and anxiety. It does a bunch of other things too, but that's one of its primary functions. There are now at least half a dozen quality papers published in quality, peerreviewed journals that show that forward ambulation, walking or biking or running,"
No, in generating optic flow in particular has this incredible property of lowering activity in the amygdala and thereby reducing levels of anxiety. There are two papers that I'd like to highlight in particular that relate to this phenomenon. The first one was published in the journal Neuron and the title of this paper
Environment," a walk each morning isn't about exercise. It's not about burning calories. It's not about any of that. It's really about getting into optic flow and reducing the levels of amygdala activation. Now, I don't have anxiety, at least I don't have chronic anxiety"
No," or generalized anxiety. I tend to have a lot of energy, but at these points in the morning, I'm not very energetic. Sometimes I'm sort of shuffling more than I'm walking in fact. And Costello is almost always shuffling"
Environment," And just walking around inside, it will generate some optic flow, but nothing like the sort of optic flow that you can generate in larger environments like out of doors environments. If you can't get outdoors, doing it indoors is perfectly fine,"
No," in the morning is absolutely vital to mental and physical health. It is perhaps the most important thing that any and all of us can and should do in order to promote metabolic wellbeing, promote the positive functioning of your hormone system, get your mental health steering in the right direction."
Environment," through that cloud cover than would be coming from a very bright indoor bulb. So getting outdoors is absolutely key. How long should you do this? It's going to depend on the brightness of the environment. It's going to depend on a number of different factors. Two minutes would be a minimum,"
Environment," that flashlight generates on the ground that if you're standing in the shade, you're going to. get less of that sunlight than you are if you're out in an open field. So this is why the time outside, it's going to need to vary depending on your particular environment."
No," But do your best to do this every day. If you miss a day, no big deal, but try not to miss more than one day. Otherwise your mental and physical health will start to suffer. And doing this each day costs nothing. It's just time"
No," of these dawn alarm lights. And I'm sorry to say this, but they're just vastly overpriced relative to what they are. They're basically a bright LED. I instead use, I have a pad that's a 930lux LightPad. I think it was designed for drawing."
No," If you want to go to sleep soon or you don't want to be awake for whatever reason, try and eliminate your exposure to light. And this, again, is not about exposure of the skin to light; this is about exposure of your eyes, of your neural retinas to light. For those of you that are concerned about blue light,"
No," when you're headed towards sleep. My colleague Samer Hattar, who is head of the chronobiology unit at the National Institute of Mental Health, has spoken about this before on my Instagram. We held an Instagram Live and I said, ""Samer, what do you think about blue blockers?"""
Environment," And he said, ""I don't think that's a good idea at all, unless it's really late at night and you're in a bright environment and you're trying to limit the amount of bright light that impacts the eyes."" Eliminating specific wavelengths of light, in Samer's opinion and also in my opinion,"
No," is not a natural thing for the visual system and the brain to experience. Some people get headaches while they work on the computer all day or staring at screens, and so they get blue blockers thinking that's going to protect them from their headaches. However, any protection that you get from headaches"
Environment," and setting them lower in the environment sets up the brain and body for sleep much better than simply just wearing some blue light blue blockers, excuse me. And please know if you do wear blue blockers that if the light in your environment is bright enough, it doesn't matter if you're blocking out the blues."
No," I find that drinking really cold water first thing in the day kind of like cramps up my insides, so I don't do that. At that point, I start thinking about and fantasizing about and craving caffeine, but I don't drink that caffeine yet. I purposely delay my caffeine intake"
No," to 90 minutes to 120 minutes after I wake up. Of course, I know when I wake up 'cause I wrote it down, although it's pretty easy to commit to memory. The reason I delay caffeine is because one of the factors that induces a sense of sleepiness is the buildup of adenosine or, as some people call it,"
No," to two hours optimizes this relationship between adenosine and wakefulness and sleepiness in a way that really provides a nice, consistent arc of energy throughout the day and brings energy down as I'm headed toward sleep and falling asleep. My primary objective early in the day is"
No," And so since my job is mainly a cerebral one where I'm writing grants and working on papers, et cetera, I fast in the early part of the day. I mentioned ingesting things like guayusa or yerba mate or, in my case, athletic greens. Many people ask, in fact there's a whole community and discussion boards, et cetera,"
No," In fact, there are now a number of clinical trials that are achieving good success and there are drugs out there only available by prescription which mimic GLP1 and are being used to treat, quite successfully, certain types of diabetes and obesity. Now, I'm not diabetic,"
No, The yerba mate leaves can be used over and over again. It seems that the GLP1 stimulating aspects of yerba mate actually are enhanced with subsequent pour overs. So there's something interesting about these teas that my tea aficionado friends tell me allows the tea to release more of some of the beneficial compounds by reusing the tea leaves.
No," if you decide to use it, and that's certainly what I do. Next, I want to talk about what I'm doing while I'm drinking all this yerba mate. 'Cause I'm not just sitting there thinking about all the GLP1 circulating in my system. I'm working."
Environment," That's what works for me. In addition, I use low level white noise. This is something that is supported by quality, peerreviewed data. We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance, but it turns out that white noise, which is essentially all frequencies of sound,"
No," or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive, mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it, turned on at a low volume, not with headphones most of the time, puts the brain into a state that's optimal for learning and workflow."
Environment," And I covered two papers during that episode. One that showed that, indeed, brain areas involved in attention, brain areas involved in focus and cognition and memory, those are engaged to a greater degree when there is low levels of white noise playing in the background."
Environment," The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging and showed the areas of the brain that are associated with dopamine release are increased by low levels of white noise. Dopamine release is associated not just with pleasure, but with motivation and craving. So everything about this 90minute block"
Environment," from the low levels of white noise to the position of my computer, how I'm standing, where my eyes are positioned, is geared towards putting me in this tunnel of work. And I have to say that while it can be a challenge to try and achieve this state in this tunnel of work some days,"
Environment," not just between me and the work that I'm doing, but between me and my ability to control my own state of mind using these various supports of the white noise, et cetera. But really those supports are peripheral to the fact that I'm creating this space. I'm funneling my brain into a state"
Environment," on the field of neuroscience, but frankly, it's also had a profound impact on how I structure my day. So after I've finished a about of work, this 90minute about of work, I force myself some days, other days I want to, but I force myself to do some sort of physical exercise"
Environment," that is going to be supportive of my brain health and brain function and organ health and bodily function in general. So I just briefly want to touch on what the structure of that exercise looks like, how it's structured within the day and how it's structured across the weeks in fact,"
Environment," based on the scientific data and what the scientific data say is best or optimal in order to promote longevity of the brain, ability to focus, as well as cardiovascular health and all the other things that we know exercise supports. Now, there are various forms of physical activity or what we call exercise,"
Environment, but those can generally be batched into two categories. First is strength and hypertrophy work. So physical movements that are designed to make you stronger and/or make your muscles larger. There's also endurance work. Physical exercise and movements that are designed to allow you to do more work over time
No," or to extend the amount of time that you can do work of any kind, both physical and mental. And we did two full podcast episodes on the details and the science and the protocols related to these topics. We did an episode on the science of strength and hypertrophy, of building strength and muscle building. And that included a lot of protocols."
No," And we did an episode on endurance. How to build any one or all of the four types of endurance, which are muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic, longdistance endurance, et cetera. So if you're interested in the specifics of those protocols, please see those episodes. However, right now I just want to emphasize"
Environment," how the data impact my day and how I structure my day in a way that I can incorporate physical movement in a way that supports my brain and health. Basically, after I finished that cognitive work about, that 90minute work about, I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour."
Environment," throughout the day or have big spikes of cortisol repeatedly. So keeping workouts relatively short can definitely help with that And certainly if you're training hard, 60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient. And for many people, including myself,"
Environment, 45 minutes or 50 minutes is probably even more optimal. The basic design of this physical exercise is that it be approximately 60 minutes. So maybe 60 plus or minus 15 minutes should be well within the margins of keeping hormonal health proper and not going too long nor making the workout so short that it's not beneficial.
Environment," And essentially what the data tell us is that in order to optimize cardiovascular and brain health and other systems of the body, we want to exercise at least five days per week. I know that seems like a lot. It certainly is a lot for certain people. Some of you, you compulsive exercisers,"
Environment," might gasp at the idea of taking two days off. I personally find that taking two full days off per week is actually both beneficial to my exercise training performance, as well as pleasant. I like those rest days. But essentially the structure of the exercise regimen"
No," that works for sake of supporting health is going to be one in which there's a 3:2 ratio. Where for a 12week period or so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks, three of those five workouts per week emphasize strength and hypertrophy and the other two emphasize endurance. Then, after 10 or 12 weeks, one over to a 10 or 12week regimen of doing a 3:2 ratio"
No," where you're prioritizing endurance work. So primarily the sorts of workouts that are described in the endurance episode and those protocols. And the other two days, you're focusing on strength and hypertrophy work merely to maintain strength and hypertrophy, to not lose the strength and hypertrophy"
Environment," that you've created. And there a lot of data now supporting the fact that maintaining muscular health and bone health is supported by resistance training, weight training of various kinds. It can also be done with body weight if you don't have access to equipment."
Environment," And, of course, that doing cardiovascular endurance work is very beneficial both to the muscles of the body, the organs of the body, but also to the brain. Many of you have probably heard that doing physical exercise of various kinds can support the production of new neurons in the brain."
Environment," Frankly, those data are specific to research animals. As far as we know, increases in neuron number are not supported by exercise in humans. There is a little bit of data that supports that maybe a few neurons might get created by running or weightlifting or things of that sort in human beings,"
Environment," but there's still a host of other reasons to have this hour or so per day where one is doing physical exercise. And those include increased blood flow to the brain. Remember, the brain is an organ too. It's the most metabolically demanding organ in your body and it's receiving those metabolic factors,"
Environment," Resistance training turns out to be as important as endurance training because of the way that it stimulates the release of particular hormones actually from bones, things like osteocalcin, which can positively impact brain function and can support the health of existing neurons"
Environment," into existing brain circuitry is actually very challenging for the brain to do. I make sure that after that workout, I get this one hour or so of exercise five days per week because of the ways that it supports my general health. And there are now hundreds of studies supporting the fact that both endurance work and strength training"
Environment," or hypertrophy training done in combination, meaning not necessarily in the same workout, but done across the week is immensely beneficial for the production of things like brainderived neurotrophic factor, for limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL6, for promoting antiinflammatory cytokines like IL10,"
Environment," provided that exercise is of the proper duration and that it's not so intense that you're actually creating damage to the various systems of the body. Now, where is the threshold between optimal, subthreshold and detrimental? This is a complicated theme"
Environment," A good rule of thumb based on the literature, and I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin prior to this strength and hypertrophy and endurance episodes, and the literature that's published in quality, peerreviewed journals really points to the fact that approximately 80% of the resistance training you do"
Environment," should be resistance training that doesn't go to what they call failure, where you can't actually move the resistance anymore. The other 20% can be of the higher intensity to failure type training. Now, with respect to endurance work, one can build up endurance without having to log long,"
No," long mileage or extensive mileage in the pool or by running. And that's because there are these other forms of endurance that can build up, for instance, the capillary beds within the muscles. Building up the capillary beds within the muscles will allow more oxygen utilization within the muscles,"
Environment," and thereby will increase your endurance both of the muscles, but also will improve brain metabolism and the way that the heart functions, so cardiovascular function. That 80/20 rule of less than failure and work to failure in the resistance exercise regime"
Environment," can be transported or translated to the endurance exercise portion by focusing on that thing that we're familiar with, which is the burn when we're running hard or cycling hard, we'll experience a kind of burning of the muscles that's associated with the lactate system. During the episode on endurance,"
No," I pointed out that that burn is not lactic acid. Contrary to common belief, it is not lactic acid. It's associated with lactate metabolism. And again, about 80% of the endurance work should not incorporate that socalled ""burn,"" but if 20% of that work or so, I should say approximately 20% of that work,"
No," or pushing past that lactate threshold for small portion, 20% or so, of endurance work in order to support brain health and function. So what does all this all look like as a protocol? Well, as I mentioned before, this 3:2 ratio. So maybe you spend 10 weeks or so or 12 weeks or so focusing mainly on endurance,"
No," where three workouts per week on endurance work, 80% of those workouts, meaning 80% of the time you're below that burn threshold, you are not experiencing a burning sensation, but that for 20% of it, you are. That, based on the scientific data, should support lactate metabolism, brain health, et cetera,"
Environment," as well as cardiovascular health and oxygen utilization. All the forms of endurance that we're aware of. And then the other two workouts would involve resistance training, again, with this 80/20 split, where 80% of the work is not to failure and 20% is. And then maybe after 10, 12 weeks, you switch,"
No," where you start emphasizing strength and hypertrophy work for three of the workouts and endurance work for two of the workouts. Now, of course, some of you will be able to train six days a week or you'll compulsively need to train seven days a week. If you decide to do that,"
Environment," Sometimes they're interspersed throughout the week. But in reviewing the scientific literature for those two episodes of the podcast and in talking to people who are really informed in the world of resistance training and endurance training and how that relates to brain health and body health,"
Environment," this seems to be the most rational and grounded protocol, so that's the one that I follow. So on any given day, I finish that work block and I train. I do some sort of resistance or endurance training. I put those on alternate days or different days, rather. So we've now talked about the arc"
Environment," that spans all the way from waking to a morning about of focused work to physical training. I have not mentioned ingesting anything or nutrients. One of the most common questions I get are what should I eat for my brain? Well, ironically enough,"
Environment," as it relates to brain health and brain function. Before we talk about that, I want to emphasize that training fasted actually has some immediate and longterm benefits. Prior to having my lab at Stanford, I was down in San Diego at UC San Diego and had an appointment"
Environment," how engaging in physical exercise while fasted can amplify the effects of that exercise, not just for sake of increasing the percentage of things like body fat burned, et cetera, but for cellular health, liver health, and the health of other organs. So where possible, I do strive to do my workout without eating anything first."
Environment," but you also don't want it too high. Very low blood sugar is terrible, but lowish blood sugar tends to give us a sense of mental clarity and focus, related to this adrenaline phenomenon that we talked about earlier. In order to be able to focus on exercise"
Environment," or work or anything else, you need sufficient electrolytes. And so many people find that if they simply ingest some water with salt, maybe a 99milligram potassium tablet, all of a sudden they feel very mentally clear and able to do physical work and mental work. So what I do is, prior to this morning exercise,"
No," sodium, potassium, as well as magnesium malate, which has been shown to offset things like delayed onset muscle soreness. That form of magnesium doesn't make people drowsy. It's not an anxiolytic like some other forms of magnesium. An anxiolytic is just one that reduces anxiety. So whether or not it's LMNT"
Environment," or whether or not you're just putting a little bit of salt into some water and ingesting that prior to training, that can be an excellent way to ensure that you're able to complete the physical exercise, even though you haven't eaten anything. And I confess, some days I will eat a little bit before my workout,"
Environment," just because I can't seem to resist eating. I want to mention the use of stimulants before physical training. This has certain benefits and certain drawbacks. The benefits are sometimes it can facilitate motivation because things like caffeine can increase the release of dopamine,"
Environment," can increase the release of epinephrin, can reduce that adenosine level in the bloodstream. So some people use caffeine before training in ways that benefit them. It can also increase fat oxidation and kind of fat metabolism and things if that's your goal. I'm not a particular fan of ingesting stimulants"
Environment," before training because of a whole set of problems associated with most forms of stimulants in the form of energy drinks, et cetera. I am not a fan of energy drinks. I did a decent portion of a previous episode on food and mood on energy drinks and some of the detrimental things they contain."
No," That seems like a simple and trivial fact, but if you want be able to think, you can't ingest large volumes of anything into your gut. So the discussion about what foods give you energy is kind of moot if you eat enormous volumes of that food. Now, the volumes are going to depend on you and your needs and your activity levels."
No," not because I'm inter carbohydrate, not because I'm on a pure carnivore diet, far from it, but because starches cause the release of serotonin in the brain and lend themselves to a state of sleepiness. Now, I should mention that about 25% of individuals have genes that encode for enzymes that allow them to eat large amounts of carbohydrate"
No," that ingesting at least 1,000 milligrams per day of the EPA form of essential fatty acid is as effective as prescription antidepressants in relieving depression. And if you're somebody who requires prescription antidepressants, Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera,"
No," it can allow people to take lower doses of those medications, which in many cases is a positive thing or a good thing to do because of the side effect profiles that many of those drugs carry. So I find these data remarkably compelling. I mean, here we have a food or a substance from food"
No," whether or not you're getting sufficient selenium to support things like thyroid function, which has an impact both on the metabolism of the body, but also the metabolism in the brain. And when I say metabolism, I don't just mean burning energy; I actually mean the rebuilding of things."
No," But again, volume is important and you can't overdo it. Costello incidentally loves butter as well. Along the lines of hormones and testosterone, I get a lot of questions about this I think because a lot of online communities are sort of obsessed with testosterone, and I just want to emphasize that, yes,"
Environment," So we should all be seeking optimal testosterone levels for ourselves, both testosterone and estrogen. And many of the things that we've discussed up until now, morning sunlight, exercise, fasting, those can support testosterone and estrogen in meaningful and positive ways. I get a lot of questions about hormone optimization."
No," Now I'd like to shift our attention towards science supportedprotocols that increase the effectiveness and our performance in everything. And by everything I mean sleep, I mean physical performance, I mean mental performance, I mean less anxiety, all the things."
No," Truly all the things. And that is something called ""nonsleep deep rest."" Nonsleep deep rest or NSDR is an acronym that I coined as an umbrella term to encompass many protocols that all have been shown, in one form or another, to support better brain and body function. Now, these protocols have names that you've heard before."
No," Things like meditation, things like yoga nidra, and things like hypnosis. All of these protocols and these activities, however, share something in common, which is they involve a deliberate and directed shift in one's state, and the shift tends to be"
No," toward a state of deeper relaxation. We certainly don't have time now to dissect out the literature on all of these. There is ample literature, I should say there is robust and ample literature, supporting the fact that a regular meditation practice is beneficial."
No," But meditation itself has many forms: transcendental meditation, loving kindness meditation, third eye meditation, walking meditation. Yoga nidra is a practice I've talked about many times before, which involves simply lying down. It doesn't involve any movement."
No," of scientific studies to promote not just states of deep relaxation, not just states of heightened focus, but also to accelerate plasticity and learning within the brain, and that's hypnosis. And I've become increasingly excited and interested in hypnosis as a tool,"
No," and not just a tool of any kind, but a tool that really can be directed toward particular goals and outcomes. And I think that's really what sets hypnosis apart as an NSDR, nonsleep deep rest, protocol from things like naps or things like yoga nidra or things like meditation."
No," And I certainly believe and understand that meditation naps and yoga nidra can be directed toward less anxiety, et cetera, but hypnosis is unique in that it's very directed. The essence of hypnosis is for the person, you, to guide your brain toward a particular outcome or change."
No," you will find hypnosis protocols for enhancing your focus, enhancing creativity, reducing pain, getting better at sleeping, reducing anxiety. Most of these are about 10 or 15 minutes long. Some of them are extremely brief. One minute long. They have a oneminute hypnosis that you can do."
No," of our brain that are involved in executive function, which is associated with our ability to focus, as well as what's called the ""default mode network,"" which is sort of the way that your brain idles, does your brain tend to idle at a level of high anxiety or calm, as well as activation of"
No," You don't want to be thinking about your heartbeat or your breathing. But what's really interesting about hypnosis is that it increases areas of the brain that are responsible for deep relaxation, focus, and selfawareness, this interoception, simultaneously. And that's very unusual compared to other states,"
No," any other states of any kind. So I've made it a practice, a daily practice in fact, that after lunch and after this walk, I do a brief 10minute hypnosis script because what I've found is that in contrast to naps and in contrast to other forms of NSDR, it really allows me to enter a state of deep relaxation,"
No," as well as the use of this hypnosis protocol has really allowed me to move through the afternoon in a way that I don't experience that dip in. Energy every once in a while I'll feel kind of sleepy or kind of out of it, but I've been really pleasantly surprised at the extent to which one can avoid that afternoon dip."
No," If you do certain things properly prior to the arrival of 2:00 or 3:00 PM. Now, if you're a napper and you want to nap, no big deal. Naps can be wonderfully beneficial. Here are the rules around napping according to the sleep science. Stanford has an excellent sleep clinic."
No," I consulted with Jamie Zeitzer, my colleague in the Stanford Sleep Laboratory, as well as Matt Walker out at Berkeley whose name I'm sure most of you are familiar with. He wrote this wonderful book, ""Why We Sleep."" Naps should be 90 minutes or less, and 20minute naps are fine,"
No," You won't dissolve into a puddle of tears. But if you're starting to sleep for an hour or more in the afternoon, that can be problematic. If you're somebody who can nap for 10, 20 minutes, that's probably better than getting a full 90minute cycle, unless you didn't get enough sleep the night before. But you really have to figure out what's right for you."
No," There's a lot of variety there. But that's essentially what the science says. Now, whether or not you nap or whether or not you do not nap, a key protocol for sleep health and wakefulness and metabolism and hormone health is viewing light in the afternoon."
No," that is strongly disruptive, very disruptive for our dopamine production. It can really screw up our sleep, and it's actually been shown in data from David Berson's lab at Brown University, one of the foremost circadian biology laboratories, as well as Samer Hattar's laboratory"
No," at the National Institute of Mental Health that viewing bright light, or even not so bright light, between these hours of 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM or even 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM can disrupt learning and memory, can disrupt the immune system and can disrupt mood in very longlasting ways. There are ways to offset that, however."
No," in the afternoon 'cause you're worried that blue light is going to disrupt your sleep. Well, you're making your eyes more sensitive to any light that you might see later in the evening, blue light or otherwise. So get that afternoon light. So what you'll probably notice is that the optimal protocols"
No," for optimizing your brain and body health and performance and sleep, et cetera, are actually really simple. But just because they're simple does not mean that they are not powerful; in fact, they are very powerful because they leverage the most powerful technology"
No," that exists, which is your nervous system. You know, we always think about technologies as devices, and indeed there are some wonderful devices out there. Some people are really into tracking their sleep and their sleep time. If you're into that, great. That's not something that I personally do,"
No," When I say ""optimize,"" I mean it puts you into a better mood overall, better state for learning, et cetera. So get that afternoon light as well. So at some point in the evening, I eat that thing that we call dinner. And while it feels sort of strange to talk about my dinner,"
No," the reason I want to talk about my dinner and what I eat for dinner is that for me, dinner, of course, is about eating I'll mention again I love eating but also about optimizing the transition to sleep and sleep. So obviously I eat foods that I enjoy."
No," I'm not one of these people that will eat anything or avoid eating anything simply to benefit from that. I do enjoy food very, very much. And so my dinner generally is comprised of things that are going to support rest and deep sleep. And that means starchy carbohydrates. It's absolutely clear that one of the major ways"
No," that we can increase serotonin, which helps in the transition to sleep, is by ingesting starchy carbohydrates. Now, I realized that starchy carbohydrates are kind of a demonized term nowadays and everyone's anticarbs, but, you know, we really should distinguish between refined sugars and complex carbohydrates."
No," or just rice and vegetables. And that's because I enjoy those foods, but also because I want to increase the amount of serotonin in my brain so that I can actually fall asleep that night. Many people who are on lowcarbohydrate diets struggle with falling and staying asleep, and that's because it's hard to achieve heightened levels"
No," of serotonin which are necessary to enter sleep. I should also mention that melatonin and serotonin fall in the same pathway. They are related hormones and neuromodulators. We won't go into their biosynthesis now, but essentially what we're talking about is a system that's biasing us towards rest and relaxation"
No," in the evening or at night, that can cause problems in the architecture or the structure of sleep. It can cause a lot of people, including me, to fall asleep very fast, sleep very deeply for three or four hours, and then wake up"
Environment," Rather, there are other things that can enhance the transition to sleep safely, which we will talk about in a few minutes. But the evening meal consists largely of carbohydrates for that specific purpose of generating a sense of calm. And, of course, carbohydrates are delicious. And because I'm doing some physical training"
Environment," and presumably you are as well, or I hope you are, 'cause it's so beneficial to one's health, that's also going to replenish my glycogen stores, which is one of the primary fuel sources for moving one's muscles and moving around and doing exercise, as well as for the brain and for cognitive function."
No," So low carbohydrates throughout the 24hour period are not something that are attractive to me. I realized that some people will do much better on a lowcarbohydrate or even ketogenic diet, but for me, and I do believe for most people, creating a situation of maybe fasting, and then lowcarb or nocarb diets"
No," for states of alertness and focus at one portion of the day, and then ingesting starchy carbohydrates for sake of inducing rest and relaxation is a at least scientifically, rationallybased protocol. It's grounded in real neurochemistry. It's grounded in things that we can point to and say,"
No," ""Ah, this food substance, this thing can support my brain, not directly because it's some magic substance that's going to make all my neurons, you know, extremely robust, but rather it's going to support sleep,"" which is perhaps the foundation of all mental and physical health. In fact, we can point to sleep as the primary way"
No," in which we can ensure our overall health, including our brain health. So let's talk about sleep and how to access sleep, how to fall asleep easily, and how to make sure that the sleep we have is of sufficient duration and quality. One way to do that is to leverage the drop in temperature"
No, and then it starts to drop. That drop in temperature of one to three degrees is vitally important for us to be able to fall asleep easily. One way that we can decrease our transition time into sleep is to accelerate that drop in temperature. And one way to accelerate that drop
No, and repair in a number of tissues. So that's one way you can leverage heat toward the transition to sleep by the ways in which exposure to heat actually cools off your body. Now let's talk about actually getting to sleep. And let's talk about behavioral protocols first. It is absolutely true that keeping
No," Keep the room cool, get under warm blankets, but rarely is it discussed why keeping the room cool is useful. The reason keeping the room cool is useful for getting into and staying asleep is that throughout the night, there are phases of sleep where you are paralyzed,"
No," socalled REM sleep, that's a healthy paralysis, presumably so you can't act out your dreams, but there are portions of the night where you can move. And one of the more important movements that you do in the middle of the night is put your hand out or your foot out or you take your face out from under the covers as a means to cool yourself,"
No, it's very hard to cool off. You would need a bucket of ice water or to get up and turn on the air conditioning or something of that sort or turn on the fan. So it's a simple but nontrivial way in which we can improve our entrance to sleep and staying asleep.
Environment," and the bottoms of the feet. You've got these portals, these radiators, if you will, that allow us to bring heat into the body and to dump heat. I don't want to go into the details now, but that episode is entitled ""Supercharge Your Exercise With Cold,"" is based on work that was done"
Environment," by Craig Heller's lab at Stanford University. Absolutely incredible data showing that the proper use of palmar cooling, so the palms or the upper half of the face or the bottoms of the feet, can vastly, I mean vastly increase the volume of exercise that one can do"
Environment," and still recover from that exercise and derive benefits from it. But this method of cooling for exercise is grounded in a basic physiological function of our palms, the bottoms of our feet, and our face, which is to dump heat or to allow cool to pass into the body."
No," So that's why in the middle of the night, as long as you're not in REM sleep, if you get too warm, you put your foot out or you put your arms out. You're actually allowing cooling of the body through what are called ""AVAs,"" arteriovenous anastomosis is the technical name, that are in the palms, the upper half of the face,"
No," and the bottoms of the feet. And that's a very efficient way to cool off your body, so you do that subconsciously. Now, there are things that one can take to enhance the transition to sleep. I am not a fan of melatonin for enhancing the transition to sleep for a couple of reasons."
No," So that's concerning. I don't know that people should be taking this hormone that has all these other effects. The other reason is that melatonin will aid the transition to sleep, but it won't keep you asleep. And many people that take melatonin find that they fall asleep more quickly,"
Environment," but then they wake up unable to fall back asleep. Three compounds that can be very beneficial for aiding the transition to sleep and for which there are wide safety margins, although please do check with your physician before taking anything, are specific forms of magnesium, something called ""apigenin"" and ""theanine."""
No," but it essentially shuts down thinking, rumination, planning, and in what we call ""executive function."" So for many people, taking 300 to 400 milligrams of magnesium bisglycinate or magnesium threonate, and there I'm referring to the elemental magnesium for you aficionados,"
No," many people find that doing that 30 to 60 minutes before sleep can aid them in falling asleep, can really help them fall asleep faster and stay asleep. Some people, however, achieve some gastrointestinal discomfort from magnesium and therefore should avoid it. Magnesium threonate and magnesium bisglycinate"
No," for many people work, however, and when coupled with apigenin and theanine, provide a sort of synergy or a sleep cocktail that seems to be very effective in aiding the transition to sleep. So apigenin is the substance that's found in chamomile. And 50 milligrams of apigenin taken 30 minutes"
No," before sleep can act as another way to shut off the forebrain and reduce rumination, reduce anxiety, and allow people to fall and stay asleep. I did a podcast with Dr. Darya Rose. She's got an excellent podcast that I highly recommend you check out. Covers a number of different health, scientific,"
No," So magnesium threonate or bisglycinate, apigenin, and theanine in combination can be very effective for aiding the transition to sleep. And I realized that not everyone wants to take supplements. I certainly am not pushing any of these. I would hope that everybody be able to fall asleep easily and stay asleep for the duration of time"
No," that they want without any supplemental help, but I do think it's important to point out some things that lie somewhere between doing nothing and taking prescription drugs, because many of the prescription drugs associated with sleep, and you all know what those are, carry other side effects."
No," and how they can impact sleep, this combination of about 300, 400 milligrams of magnesium threonate or bisglycinate, 50 milligrams of apigenin, and 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine alone or in combination have been beneficial to many people. And there are excellent studies"
No," By going to bed earlier, you're going to get the longer duration of sleep. But I realized that there are social reasons and workrelated reasons why going to bed at 8:30 or 9:00 is not necessarily beneficial to your life. So in that case,"
No," in the middle of the night because of anxiety or because they have to use the restroom. It's perfectly fine to flip on the lights, but keep the lights dim. But if you flip on those lights, try and flip them off as soon as possible and try and get back into bed."
No," And if you have trouble falling asleep again and you absolutely need to sleep, that's where these NSDR, these nonsleep deep rest protocols, can really be beneficial, even though the NS, the nonsleep part, might make you think that they will prevent you"
No," from falling asleep. Rather than trying to fight your mind, trying to fight anxiety, which is always a terrible thing to do, I always say it's very hard to control the mind with the mind, look to the body. And that's what NSDR scripts do."
No," Things like yoga nidra, even the sleep hypnosis done in the middle of the night if you wake up and want to fall back asleep oftentimes will help you fall back asleep immediately. And if they don't, they will at least put your brain and body into a state of deep relaxation"
No," that more closely mimics the sleep state that you ought to be in than the awake, ruminating, stressing about the fact that you're not sleeping state. So if you wake up in the middle of the night, really try and get back to sleep. And if you can't do that by doing, for instance,"
No," long exhale breathing, which can work, use some other tool of the body to shift the mind. And the tools that I'm recommending are of the nonsleep deep rest variety. So now we've essentially traveled around the clock, so to speak, from the time where one wakes up until the time they start working,"
Environment," until the time they exercise, eat lunch, do an NSDR, head to sleep, get to sleep, maybe wake up, get back to sleep, et cetera. I want to emphasize that, although people's schedules vary, most people are doing more than one or two work bouts per day."
No," about maintaining a schedule Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, et cetera, most of us, I would hope, would alter their schedule somewhat on the weekends in order to recover and get some additional rest. And I want to emphasize I absolutely do that. I take one day per week where I go full Costello, where I essentially do nothing in a structured way."
No," but I do take rest. I don't think that one has to follow the same schedule every single day; however, I do think there are a few things that people should do every single day, if possible, and those are get morning sunlight, because if you don't your circadian rhythms"
No," and your health, et cetera, and your mood are going to start to drift, and to try and get sleep on a regular basis. And, of course, some of the greatest of things in life happen after 10:00 PM and some of those even involve sleepless nights of various kinds."
No," I certainly don't want to discourage people from having a social life or from having a robust party life, if that's your thing, or for enjoying life because that's certainly one of the main things that we should all be pursuing, is to enjoy life. The only point I want to make about sleep is"
No," that if you happen to stay up late, it's still best to get up at your regular wakeup time. It's a very simple solution to a problem that a lot of people have, which is they stay up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and then they tend to sleep late, and then it tends to disrupt their rhythm."
No," Try on most days and most nights to wake up at more or less the same time and try to go to sleep at more or less the same time. In fact, I was talking to Matt Walker about this recently, and he was also surprised to see these new data and I was surprised to see these new data that emphasize that if you get a poor night's sleep"
No," and then get to sleep. If you go to bed a couple hours earlier, it's probably not going to kill you, but try to not go to bed, for instance, at 6:00 PM, because you were up the entire night before. That can really be disruptive. The other thing I want to emphasize is"
No," to the kinds of work you do. If you're an artist or a sculptor or you build furniture, whatever it is that you happen to, you teach children or they teach you, whatever it happens to be, of course, please adapt and modify what I've described today"
No," what we call, ""dependent variables."" Some studies were looking at effects on blood sugar, other on mood. So I hope that makes clear why the rationale behind what I provided today. If you're learning from this podcast and enjoying it, please support us by subscribing to the YouTube channel."

No," , and teachers should be alert for opportunities to make each learning experience yield greater results in learning . Thus , it is clear that held instruction should be made as practical as possible for this purpose . Opportunities should be"

Environment, and other persons in general . They do not come to the aid of others in time of need and alleviate their sufferings . So one of the objectives of health education is to cultivate a sense of civic responsibility through health education . People are made conscious of
Environment," social crimes like spitting , anywhere sneezing and coughing , on the faces of others and not isolating themselves when suffering from infectious diseases or config ' contagious diseases . In short , health education aims at teaching pupils to accept and apply democratic"
Environment," principles relating to health matters . At home , in school and in the community in this way , health education will contribute to the life of the community through the development of educated citizens who know the advantages and necessity of supporting health mesh"

No," now . Let 'S change that color here , it 's something called drug induced nutritional deficiencies , most medications do n't come without a cost"
No," occult blood loss . Now , cold blood loss causes iron deficiency and leads to anemia , so it reduces your iron and makes you become anemic , which means that you have low o2 low oxygen . So what do you need to heal repair make energy ? You need oxygen ."
Environment," than seven hours of nutritional education in their entire uh . Pursuance of a doctorate of a doctor 's degree so that that you know most of you may may not realize this , but doctors do n't know jack about nutrition . The vast majority of them know very"
No," risk mitigation and why are you treating symptoms without asking the bigger question or answering the bigger question , which is why the symptoms exist ? So what ends up happening ? Is you go on one drug and maybe that drug is mitigating your risk ?"
No," , you 're , taking energy effort time spending money To go nowhere and that 's a big part of what mitigating risk is all about . It 'S it 's ! It 'S mitigating risk , without asking , what 's the new risk that we 're creating right ? That 'S why in medicine there 's this terminology"
No, that you should ask if you 're being put on a drug which is risk benefit ? What is the risk of taking the medicine versus what is the benefit the medicine might provide
No," , then we have again treating symptoms if you 're , if you 're taking the drug to treat a symptom like , for example , a pain , medication or or you 're taking um like a skin cream for low . You know lotion to with medication in it that is , for dry skin or for a rash on the skin you 're"
No," i 'm going to share a story with you , because i had a woman one time . Actually this happened several times , but she came to see me . She was on thyroid medication , now the the particular drug she was on we 'll just we 'll just share the story . The drug"
No," um , you better get your copy , no grano pain , quickly and start reading it so senthroid contains gluten fillers . So again , this is an example of people that have actually come to see me in the"
No," case of this one woman . She was on centroid , she was gluten . Sensitive gluten was actually what was reducing her t4 in the first place , but now she was taking a drug to correct the problem , but was n't really correcting the problem . It was"
No," disease in the first place . Again . What i want you to envision in your mind is the hamster on the wheel right , you do n't go anywhere , you ca n't get anywhere . The drug does n't solve your problem per se . It actually contributes to the problem . Now , that 's not to say that some medicines"
No," scenario . That 'S very , very common . A lot of medicines have gluten fillers . So if you 're , following my no grain , no pain , diet , protocols and you 're taking multiple medications , you know one of the things that you should really be doing is read the inactive"
No," the drug drug labels . Generally , when you go to the pharmacy to pick up your medicine they 'll come with this . You know this little insert and if you unfold it , it 's like it 'll fit on the wall . It 'S huge right and on there you 're going to find a section that reads : inactive"
No," thinking gosh , dr osborne . What what am i supposed to do ? I ca n't eat out . You know i ca n't take medicines because they 're contaminated with gluten , like what what am i going to do ? Well , i want you to understand why this is so important when"
No," know a young guy and they 'll say jack is working tonight : jack 's 19 . He does n't really care about your glutenfree diet . He understands the glutenfree menu to the same level of expertise that a fifthgrader who 's , never heard of gluten , understands"
No," this risk of crosscontamination that you 're going to get persistent exposure to , and so restaurant dining is a nightmarish of an idea . If you really want to improve now that you know many of you again are thinking gosh you know , eating out is such an important part of"
No," my social structure . But what i want you to understand is if you decide that you 're going to attempt to eat out and do no grain , no pain , you 're , probably going to be pretty unsuccessful in regards to getting lots of"
No," crosscontamination in regards to getting exposure to these things . So it 's just not something that i recommend in the case of the woman that i 'm talking about right now , she would eat out on a weekly basis . She wanted to go eat out with her friends again . I"
No," understand that social interrelationships are very important . My advice is : if you 've got friends that always want to go to restaurants eat before you leave and go hang out and have the camaraderie , but do n't do it while sabotaging your plans at returning"
No," something uh , that 's good for you right and so do n't fool yourself , chickfila ! Sorry chickfila chickfila is not a healthy , fast food option . I hope that 's , not a news flash to any of you watching they have this connotation of health , but but"
No," at the end of the day it 's still fast food . It 'S still highly chemically processed and manipulated and uh , and , and you know it it 's still not good for you right . So do n't do n't lie to yourself if you again , if you 've got a copy of no grain , no pain ."
No," Okay number three on the list is alcohol . Now i 'm going to cross through the word abuse and just because most of you are probably thinking well , i do n't abuse alcohol so so what really does that mean alcohol"
No," abuse ? Well , alcohol abuse is you . You know , in my opinion , is you 're drinking it daily right . If you have a glass of wine at dinner every night , that 's in my opinion , if you 're trying to get healthy and you 're not"
No," this is abusing alcohol . It 'S it 's you 're using too much and your body ca n't overcome it . If you drink alcohol not every day , but you drink more heavily on the weekends and it 's consistent"
No," alcohol number one . It robs your body of the b. Vitamins is actually a disease called warnicky korsakoff syndrome , which is alcohol . Stealing your b vitamins from you . You need b vitamins to heal and repair . Many"
No, of you were already b vitamin deficient because of years of gluten induced intestinal damage and so you 're already malnourished . Keeping alcohol in the equation is going to only serve to sabotage the other areas where you 're working hard to try
No," to improve your diet . So alcohols robs b vitamins . It steals them , it 's a diuretic , so it will dehydrate you . Alcohol is a direct poison and the byproduct of alcohol , which is acetaldehyde . Your liver , has to deal with ."
No," Remember if you are gluten sensitive , your livers probably are already struggling . Alcohol also feeds yeast . Now , if you 've listened to me for any length of time , you know that yeast is one of those things that mimics"
No," gluten . So if you 've got a yeast , overgrowth you 've got a gluten reactivity problem , even if you 're not eating gluten alcohol promotes yeast overgrowth in your gi tract alcohol also suppresses your immune system 's function ."
No," , if you find yourself and you 're still struggling and you 're , not where you want to be in your health , it 's definitely a nono . Now , if you 're , healthy and you 're doing everything well , and you generally follow a good diet . If you want to have a drink here or there , i do n't"
No," fault you for that . I do n't judge you for that . I do n't judge you . Even if you abuse it , that 's the price you choose to pay , but my point is a healthy alcohol consumption is going to be in great degrees of moderation and moderation is not one glass a night"
No," instead of the bottle . Every night , like , like some of you , have a definition of moderation that needs to be checked and balanced . So again , alcohol for many different reasons , is problematic if you 're trying to recover and repair , and it 's one of those and again in the case"
No," of the woman that we 're talking about tonight , she liked to eat out she liked to join her friends and they liked to Have a drink socially when they would go out . So here she was taking a medicine that had gluten in it and gluten was the reason"
No," why she was sick . In the first place , she was eating at a restaurant on a weekly basis and when she would go to the restaurant she would be getting exposure and drinking alcohol as well . So that kind of is the third aspect right and then , if we"
No," What do they do ? What do they do in grade school , so in grade school they take away pe . They deprive your children of physical activity right , so they take away pe and they make them sit at a desk and follow orders all day long"
Environment," really go outside and play so we 've over emphasized this to such a huge degree and we 've completely taken the physical education and the physical activity of children , and we 've said that has to be extracurricular . If you 're going to do that , you 've got to join the sports team"
Environment," we 've done this to the children , but the adults are just as bad right , because what do you do every day you go to work and what do you do at work ? You sit chip , typically at a computer desk , right and so you 're on your butt all day , and you think that going to the gym ."
Environment," Maybe if you even do go to the gym a lot of people struggle to consistently go to a gym , but maybe they get . You know anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes right and then but they 're at work and they 're sitting at a computer eight to"
No," day long so we 're mentally emotionally drained , we do n't have physical energy to do more , because our bodies do what . When we sit for eight hours a day , what did our bodies do ? They atrophy ? They shrink . Actually , what happens when you sit at a desk ? Is your your posture goes forward"
No," get pain right and then , when you get pain you reach for medicine , right , pain , relief , medicines and many of these medicines affect your liver . They affect your kidneys , they affect your gi tract , they cause vitamin mineral deficiencies , so you 're really"
No," and as you get older into the twilight years of you know , you do n't want to you , do n't want to become decrepit and kind of sneak away as a burden on society or a burden to your family members . You want to maintain your function as long as you possibly can and not be a burden to"
Environment," others . Then you have to prioritize this peace and again , in this case this woman . She just her excuse was , i do n't have time to exercise it just too tired to exercise yet she had time to go to lunch and have drinks taking in poisons right . So it does it 's"
Environment," out where exercise fits in . Maybe it 's not the gym , maybe you do some calisthenics at home . Maybe you add some high intensity interval training periodically throughout the day . Maybe you put a treadmill underneath your workstation so that you can walk instead"
Environment," healthy . But if you do n't , you know there are very few doctors that can predict the future . Actually , i do n't know any doctors that can predict your future , but i can guarantee an outcome if you do n't exercise"
No," as you consistently over consume alcohol and you consistently eat out at restaurants who do n't care about your health and feed you poison and call it food , and You take medicines to treat the symptoms that you 're experiencing"
No," , i 've got some things for you tonight and one . If you do n't have your copy of no grain , no pain . You can pick that up uh at nograinepainbookcom or on barnes and noble website or amazon 's website or any other major bookstore . But i 've got a qr code for you here too . This is a gift"
No," for you . We'Ve been working on this for a while , my team , and i , and so what this is is it is a this . This qr code will take you straight to glutenfree society and there 's a special page that we 've got set up , that have no grain , no pain phase , one and"
No," prepare the foods and the meals that Are going to keep you lined up with phase one and with phase two of the diet ? So again , i wan na encourage you to use that qr code and uh in that resource as you go through the challenge , all right . We'Re gon na ! Take your questions . Now"
No," , let 's see here , what does a liver need to heal from medication or poor diet ? You know liver needs , a break honestly , um , your liver is so dynamically wonderful as an organ . It can heal very quickly , but the more you throw medicine at it . The more it 's . It 'S having to deal"
No," definitely cheating is not a good idea if you 're gluten sensitive , even if you do n't have celiac disease , let 's see here is too much folic acid during pregnancy , contributor to autism . I heard that from a family doctor . Well , folic acid dentist"
No," But let 's see here , what do you recommend for kids ? Eight years old for covid um , predominantly kelly , vitamin c it 's safe for them to take vitamin c , it 's safe for them to take nack and"
No," that product into your diet as a staple um because of its until they come out with an organic product . I 'D love to see that company they 're , you know , they 're a family run company , i 'd love to see them come out with an organic product"
No," , so if you 've got an antibiotic and you had to take it because you had some kind of infection that that needed antibiotic as a treatment . What can you do to support your gi tract recovery um ? We actually have a product , it 's called ultrabiotic defense"
No," really master the diet , because , where people most people get their crosscontamination is that either they 're eating out right or they 're . Trusting another family member to prepare their food , or they just are in the process of"
No, getting educated about the glutenfree diet and they make mistakes . So so you know it just depends on where you 're at in your process . Is there a way to restore platelet counts safely ? Without transfusion or medication depends on why nancy you have
No," , every 15 minutes until you flush and flush is diarrhea . It 'S like prepping for a colonoscopy you 're going to flush out your bowels . So that 's the simple way to to to reset your bowels and flush . Everything out . You know if you 're in , if you 're in bad"
No," people when we go on the no grain , no pain protocol phase two is night shade free because there are compounds in nightshades that can cause and create an inflammatory process . The other reason"
No," why white potatoes in general can be problematic is they 're high carbohydrates . So if your diet is already too high in carbohydrates and you 're eating lots of potatoes as a staple food , that might be something that sabotages you to get better control over your"
Environment," blood sugar over time . Um , let 's see here , i am gluten grain free , regular exercise , adequate sleep and no meds . I keep my diet . Roughly 33 protein carbs fat , all organic . My recent blood count showed elevated albumin , globulin ratio , albumin"
No," it 's really , it 's it 's it 's . What you like its taste is relative and i hate to be so simplistic , but i mean alternatives . I would send you to glutenfree society 's recipe section , because that might give you a bunch of ideas . I might also send you to"
No," So it 's it 's just i 'm i 'm i 'm not wild about liposomal . For that reason , for somebody who 's trying to follow a glutenfree diet um , i like that . So that 's i like that . Testimonial there go ."
No," I do n't know where we were lost it . I like this . So , for me it was six months , but i followed the diet and went to see him and got tested . I will never eat grains again . Um felt , like i was dying , was taking a lot of medication . I do n't"
No," that 's what the right detox and the Right diet , the right lifestyle and everything else can stress from politics : news job , wife , husband , cause people not to heal . Of course , it can stress is a major deteriorating factor around health"
No," taking three grams of val cyclovir daily forever ? I i would question why you 're taking val cycle , if you 're for the rest of your life daily , i mean you know , that 's a drug that is designed to treat herpetic disease , and so , if you 've been diagnosed"

Environment," does n't mean that the reason the nodules or the cancer started went away right . It 'S like it 's like sweeping dirt . Under a rug . You know the problem does n't go away . The dirt 's , still there you 've just hidden it from view"
No," opinion would be the best thing he could do . There 'S not like a supplement that he needs to do or something that he needs to take , especially if his entire gland has been removed . I mean he 's going to be on medicine , the rest of his life , but um"
No," success rate of digestion . So gluten shield is not just something . That 'S designed to protect you from gluten crosscontamination or exposure , but it 's also a fullspectrum digestive enzyme . So if you have digestive distress and struggle , you know some people do better"
No," their jerseys to to make sure they 're a2 a2 and if they 're doing that , and they can show you evidence of that , then you know if you want to try Dairy into your diet , that would be an option . Let 'S see , how do i read the qr code when"
No," there are a number of studies and researchers believe that it contributes to cancer among other problems . So i 'm not a big fan of folic acid . Let 'S see , the frustrating thing for me is that i ca n't build endurance . I walk 30 minutes each day and come back"
No," exhausted . I 'M 71 hashimoto 's suggest i mean that 's a whole . Can of water suggest a lot of suggestions there , but ultimately , if there 's something that 's holding you back or stopping you from building up your endurance , you know"
No," you know one of the things if you 're exhausted after a 30minute walk - and i tell you to do tabata or Tell you to do highintensity interval you 're - probably not going to do that very well either . If you 're , that tired and your diet 's really dialed in you know , but you 're"
No," sure that what you 're doing your diet and lifestyle are actually correcting those elevations and high antibodies to your thyroid , because i mean there 's a lot that could be potentially going on there that it 's just too much To open"
No," gluten derivatives . How long can detox symptoms last , i 'm four months into being gluten grain free , if you 're , four months in and you 're better , but you 're plateaued and you 're falling no grain , no pain ? Angela you 've probably got other things going on that"
No," - and you find yourself at a point where you 've plateaued out it 's because you 're missing something if you read the last chapter of no grain - no pain , i talk about that very , very specifically how a person can get through The protocol and do tremendously better , but then , when they"
No," when they hit those plateau points , it 's really time to seek out individualized testing so that you can get better answers . Uh , how to increase weight on a glutenfree diet , be patient"
No," increase your weight even on a glutenfree diet is to make sure you 're eating enough calories and potentially even eating more calories than what you might burn in a day . If your attempt is try to gain weight , but if you 're trying to gain weight , the healthiest way to"
Environment," gain weight is to build lean . Mass lean mass would mean that you need to exercise physically to build the muscle mass of your body and that will also help you gain the right kind of weight how to do a liver flush without lemon you , do n't you really do n't"

No," you do n't have an audible account when you open an audible account for the first time you get to pick a free book , and so , if you , this is news To you and you had do n't - have a copy . No grain , no pain , that 's a way to get a free copy in the audio version ."
Environment," based foods , but you find yourself or you 're struggling with high oxalate but you 're , not eating oxalate , it could be that you have mold growing inside of you , that 's producing the oxalate . It could also be that you 're living in a moldy environment where you 're being exposed"
No," you have to understand celiac and microscopic colitis if you still have that and you 're gluten free and you 're still struggling , and your gut is still problematic . It 'S very possible your diet 's fine , except for your eating foods that you might also be reactive to that"
No," are also contributing to that persistent colitis , and that 's where you need additional testing , because taking the destination for the rest of your life is not a solution . It 'S a bandage , and you do n't you know you do n't want to bandaid this , because"
No," , can we say they work and the answer right now is : if you 've gotten one , we know they do n't work , because if you 've gotten one , you can still get covered if you 've gotten one , you can still spread . Covid , if you 've gotten one , you can still have"

No," look , i i thank you for spending your evening with me . I 'M really hoping you guys are getting behind the no grain , no pain challenge again . The contest ends at the end of february , we 're going to be giving away a lot of great prizes for the winners"
No, It was n't like it hit me all at once . I struggled with feelings of fear and worry over the years when my doctor told me that the pain in my hands was caused by arthritis . Those feelings continued to grow . I started to worry that I would n't be able to do the things I loved like
No," gardening playing the piano . I started having panic attacks and feeling like I could n't breathe . I already had asthma , which can make breathing hard anyway . I was so stressed that I had trouble falling asleep at night . I found myself so tired during the day that I could"
No," barely focus on my work . It never occurred to me . The mental health and physical health were so closely connected . I guess because you go to different kinds of health professionals for help , but I saw a news story that made me realize we really should n't"
No," think of them as two different kinds of health . We'Re joined today by dr Ellen Welch , a medical doctor who says we should be thinking about our health much more broadly , dr. What kinds of things Besides , our physical health are important. Thank you for having me on"
No," Today and yes , that 's correct , when we talk about someone who is healthy , we are talking about physical health , but also mental health , social wellbeing and other resources . A person needs to live a full life . That sounds like a lot more than just caring someone when they have"
No," a fever . You'Re right , health is n't just the absence of disease . It also refers to a person 's ability to bounce back from an illness or other challenges in life . There are many factors that contribute to our mental and physical health . Some"
Environment," factors include a person 's genetics , their environment , their relationships , their education and their employment . These all impact a person 's ability to lead a healthy life . So what can our viewers do to improve the kind of health you 're talking about , certainly eating a"
Environment, healthy diet and giving regular exercise is directed by a physician or keys to good health . It is also important to have healthy coping skills when challenges come up in a job or a relationship having healthy social relationships can also contribute to a person 's overall

No," mental health is the way our thoughts , feelings and behaviors affect our lives . Helped me realize I needed to address my ongoing stress as a health issue , both physical and mental . I talked about this with my doctor and he connected me with a therapist . I still meet with my"
Environment," therapist from time to time . In addition to the diet exercise and physical checkups for my doctor , my therapist has helped me learn to manage my stress , develop healthy relationships and a more positive attitude . Each and every day is filled with unique ups and downs , but"
No, understanding the link between my physical and mental health has made a big difference in my ongoing recovery journey
Environment," There are growing concerns of human impact on nature , oceans , forests and the planet overall . But what about the impact of nature on humans ? The relationship between the environment and humans is symbiotic . We impact our surroundings and our surroundings impact us . Every force"
Environment," has an equal and opposite force . We might not be able to see it , but our environment is affecting our health every single day . Environmental health works with the relationships between people and their environments . It is the public health field that monitors"
Environment," were toxically high levels of lead in the water , we realize just how integral clean water is to everyday life . Water is n't the only thing that can impact us like this think about air quality . Poor air quality and air pollution have been linked with a decrease in happiness and"
Environment," as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the Haitian earthquake in 2010 . These types of events can impact human life , our living environments and the surrounding areas . Environmental health scientists can work in events like this , with disaster relief and disaster"
Environment," preparedness . Now , let 's bring it a little bit closer to home . Did you know that neighborhood safety is an aspect of environmental health , for example , if you live in an unsafe neighborhood , you might not feel safe going outside or having your children go outside . This means that"
Environment," you do not spend as much time outside and you get less exercise , unlike diet and exercise . Environmental health is not something that can be addressed at the individual level . So what can you do ? Environmental health scientists work in many different settings to work with all"
Environment," disaster relief . Disaster preparedness , environmental health scientists work with understanding how the relationship between humans and the environment works to better improve human quality of life . So what can you do to help save the"

No," and that 's been really important , whereas i think if it had been Different people coming in for short times no continuity . I would have worried about mum very much . The stability of staffing achieved for vicky is a mark of"
No," as a way of making sure that Those people who come to me , i can trust the rest of the panel - agrees that achieving stability of staffing builds good relationships , and it should be something that all domiciliary care agencies"
No," aspire to achieve . We certainly want care workers to be talking to uh members of the family , particularly where , where people are using the care service themselves ca n't express their views to to"
No," understand . What 'S what 's normal , what 's usual , what does this reaction mean ? It can involve the families , but actually you ca n't learn about what people might want , what they like , what they dislike , how they"

No," different different job and then came back into his life again about eight months afterwards . But throughout that time i maintained links with job as a voluntary befriender . So from from my point of view and from john 's , i hope that continuity , that"
No, as normal . A life as possible home care is not just about staying in your home ; it may be about getting out of your home and into your local community . It 'S really important that people reach

No," So much yeah , it 's definitely choices for everybody , and so i ended up doing the social website and then um for uni . I was thinking i 'm doing midwifery . So this course kind of really helps that"
No," you could do like i 've . Never seen child nuts in mental health , nursing , disabled learning anything really good . It 'S been a good decision"
No," , so it 's just going to be more of a general presentation , so i hope you guys enjoy it . So , let 's start with what recreational therapy is so recreational therapy is a systematic process that utilizes"
Environment, recreation and other activitybased interventions to address the assessed needs of individuals with illnesses or disabling conditions as a means to psychological and physical health
Environment," recovery and wellbeing . Recreational therapy is also known as therapeutic recreation , and it is a treatment service designed to restore remediate and rehabilitate a person 's"
Environment," personcentered approach to therapy where recreation , experiential , based interventions and psychoeducational processes are the primary treatment modalities . Recreational therapists , use , recreation and leisurebased activities , for example"
No," , art , music sports games , nature relaxation , etc to provide developmentally appropriate support to patients and their families to assist . In the improvement of the patient 's emotional"
Environment," , social , physical , spiritual and cognitive wellbeing to help identify , develop and improve a patient 's , functional abilities and independence to decrease or eliminate barriers to successful participation and recreation and leisure"
Environment," activities to explore and develop positive coping skills , work on community reintegration And help transition pace patients from a care setting to develop a healthy leisure lifestyle that supports continued recovery"
No," quality of life , people who have low participation and engagement in their lives and community individuals who have internal external or system barriers to participation and engagement . Individuals who could benefit from interventions that modify"
Environment," their level of functioning people that need modifications of leisure activities , so they can still participate . People who need assistance in choosing attainable , alternative leisure activities that"
Environment," Rep therapy matters because it really embraces an emphasis on health , which includes not just the absence of an illness but the enhancement of the physical , cognitive , emotional , social and spiritual and also leisure"
Environment," the client 's interests , family and or community to make the process of therapy meaningful and relevant . Recreational therapists have a very unique perspective regarding the social , cognitive , physical , spiritual and leisure"
No," needs of the patient , and then recreational therapists weave the concept of healthy living into treatment to ensure not only improved functioning , but also to enhance independence and successful involvement in all aspects of Life"
No," It incorporates the clients , interests , family and community to make the therapy process meaningful and relevant , and it teaches lifelong skills to improve quality of life . So in the holistic approach of recreational therapy"
Environment," , we have the expertise to assist individuals coping with the stress of an illness or disability through leisure and recreationbased treatment options . The recreational therapist empowers clients to manage their illness"
No, Here is an example of some of the research that we use to incorporate into the client 's treatment . Recreational therapy is also personcentered .
No," We approach treatment with the perspective that the whole person should be considered . So , for example , we ask questions like what does this person like to do for fun ? What does this person 's familial or social support look like ?"
No," Where does this person live ? What resources are available to them ? What are the person 's religious or spiritual beliefs ? What are the person 's physical , cognitive , emotional , emotional or social limitations"
Environment," person 's health fits in with the rest of their life , the kinds of things that they like to do and the environment that they live in recreational Therapy has a lasting effect . What we do is we teach clients and our patients lifelong skills"
No," to improve their quality of life . When individuals are suffering from a physical injury or mental illness , not only do they need help learning how to live with their disability , but they need to know how to enhance their quality of life by reducing the"
Environment," isolation they may experience , and they need to know how To successfully participate in leisure activities , recreational therapists work in a lot of different settings with a variety of populations ."
No," , neurological disabilities and then cognitive and learning disabilities . Recreational therapists work in settings such as hospitals like the va , behavioral , pediatric and rehab hospitals , skilled nursing facilities , residential treatment , centers"
Environment," school systems , group homes and longterm care , facilities , outpatient services , correctional facilities and then community parks and recreation , and then i 'll go over the education requirements . Qualifications and"
Environment," certifications needed to become a recreational therapist , so the academic pathway for recreational therapists include obtaining a bachelor 's degree or higher in recreational therapy or therapeutic recreation from an"
Environment," accredited university . Here there is an emphasis on coursework in the physical , biological and behavioral sciences , including recreation and leisure theory . From there , students are required to complete a"
Environment," formal internship , a minimum of 14 weeks and 560 hours under the supervision of a certified therapeutic recreation specialist . From there the student passes a certification exam through the nctrc and from there they are"
Environment," nationally certified as a certified therapeutic recreation specialist , and then we have to maintain that credential every five years through the nctrc recertification process and obtain ceus um . Currently , there are the following"
Environment," requirements and pass a knowledgebased exam . Ctrs is the evidence that the individual , through education and experience has met the nctrc certification standards . Recreational therapists are accredited"
Environment," through a lot of different agencies . A couple of these include the national council for therapeutic recreation , certification , the centers for medicare and medicaid joint commission , the commission on accreditation of"
Environment," rehabilitation facilities and the individuals with disabilities . Education act , so the service delivery model for recreational therapy is assessment , planning , implementation , evaluation and documentation ."
Environment," diagnostically , appropriate baseline data that identifies the patient 's strengths and limitations and functional areas . Physical cognitive , social , behavioral , emotional , spiritual and leisure , recreational therapists , utilize , these assessment"
No," procedures , structured interview , direct observation , performance testing , information gathering from other treatment , team members and record review , and this is an example of a an assessment created by"
No, the world health organization . The next step in the systematic process is planning recreational therapists interpret assessment data to develop an individualized treatment plan that includes relevant shortterm
No," longterm and discharge goals . All factors are considered so the client 's diagnosis , any precautions or contraindications when we 're developing the treatment plan . Recreational therapists , collaborate with the patient , sometimes their family"
No," , other team , members and consultants in the development of the treatment plan . Implementation is next and probably the most fun part of being a recreational therapist . These implementation strategies are based upon the assessment and treatment"
No," interventions based upon patient progress or changing their condition and evaluation . Recreational therapists conduct formative , evaluations of the patient 's progress that are based upon their treatment goals"
No," , reviews of the intervention strategies and consideration of patient satisfaction and functional outcomes from there a summative evaluation of patient progress is made that determines the effectiveness of the treatment plan ."
No, the patient to continue to improve and work on their skills following treatment . Wreck therapists also develop and document discharge plans . In order to summarize the patient 's response to treatment and then note recommendations for
Environment," continued services to meet the patient 's specific needs , so interventions and initiatives , i have just a few examples of interventions , modalities and initiatives that recreational therapists use . Some of these include leisure education"
No," , aquatic therapy . Therapeutic play : animal assisted therapy , adaptive sports , experiential therapy , expressive therapy , anger , stress and pain management , cognitive stimulation , community reintegration"
No," , relaxation therapy , horticulture therapy , bibliotherapy and adventure therapy . This is an example of an intervention outline . Recreational therapists have a very structured way of implementing modalities and interventions . So"
No," it 's always good to identify the objectives and suggested learning comes of an initiative , resource and materials needed space required group size . How long it 's going to take to facilitate the group"
No," So i 'm going to go over some common outcomes of recreational therapy . Some of these include physical functioning , such as improved balancing coordination and fine motor skills , mobility , endurance , strength and flexibility . Recreational"
No," improved emotional functioning . So an improvement in resiliency emotional regulation and improved mood , selfesteem decreased anxiety and depression and then pain , stress and anger management ."
Environment," So i 'm going to go over a couple of models for recreational therapy practice . This is the leisure ability model , and essentially the idea is that the needs of the clients start to decrease the longer that they"
Environment," are engaging in recreational and leisure activities and then the role of the recreational therapist kind of lessens the more independent they become in their Leisure activities , so the leisure ability model is based"
Environment," upon the concepts of internal locus of control , intrinsic motivation , personal causality , freedom of choice and flow . It uses treatment , leisure , education and recreation participation as the basis for service ."
Environment," The overall intended outcome of rec therapy services , as defined by this model , is a satisfying , independent and freely chosen leisure lifestyle . Assumptions for this model include every individual has a right to leisure"
Environment," , many individuals , experience barriers to participation and leisure , and then individuals with disabilities face more frequent barriers to leisure . Another common model is the health protection health promotion model . A very similar concept here"
No," as the client progresses in treatment . They start out with a small locus of control and it is more therapist directed as they reach stability , the recreational therapist 's role kind of narrows , and then the treatment becomes a little"
Environment," using recreation and leisure as a tool , the role of the recreational therapist narrows and the individual gains , independence and leisure participation assumptions for this Model include activity , recreation and leisure interventions , facilitate an"
No, Recreational therapists often work within an interdisciplinary treatment team . Recreational therapy is great at complementing other scopes of practice because it provides a comprehensive and holistic approach to treatment
No," that encourages growth and progress and many life domains . Rec therapy complements goals and objectives set with other members of the treatment team , so we work with the doctors . Clinical therapists , occupational and physical therapists , etc"
No," , and then we offer unique modalities to improve functioning . So i have an example of continuity of care say a recreational therapist was going to facilitate a community outing for patients with physical and cognitive"
No, disabilities and say the treatment team consisted of a recreational therapist and an occupational therapist . Here the recreational therapist would work on goal . Setting with the patient to address their physical and emotional
Environment," barriers , so we would talk with the client about , if they 're , using a wheelchair um , how to navigate navigate through doors um , how to like deal with crosswalks and traffic"
No," , curb cuts how to appropriately interact in social situations . How to use assertive communication skills , etc , and then the occupational therapist on the outing might help with things like activities of daily living , so getting"
No," dressed , bathroom mobility , eating , etc , and that is about it . To summarize , recreational therapy is comprehensive . Evidencebased , systematic effective health focused nationally recognized and accredited"
No," from your go to webinar control panel , so feel free to take those with you um and then our next webinar is going to be on february 26 on service and treatment and recovery . So look out for an invite for that . Thank you ."
No," Hello , everyone today , I will be going to discuss to you the treatment settings and the therapeutic programs . At the end of the session . You will be able to discuss traditional treatment settings describe different types of Residential Treatment settings and the"
No," services they provide describe Community treatment programs that provide services to people with mental illness , identify the factors that distinguish recovery , programs from traditional treatment and identify barriers to effective treatment . For homeless people with mental illness"
No, multidisciplinary mental health care team and identify the different roles of the nurse in varied treatment . Settings and programs so remember class that Mental Health Care has undergone profound changes in
No," the past 50 years before the um . The uh 1950s Humane treatment in large State facilities was the best available strategy for people with chronic and persistent mental illness , and many of"
No," whom stayed in such facilities for months or years in 1950s . The introduction of the psychotropic medications occurred , no , which offered the first hope of successfully treating the symptoms of mental illness in a meaningful way"
No," by the 1970s focus on clients , rights and changes in commitment loss which led to the institutionalization and a new era of treatment . So during also this time , institutions could no longer hold clients with mental illness indefinitely and treatment in the least restrictive"
Environment," environment became a guiding principle and right large State hospitals . Emptied treatment in the community was intended to replace much of State Hospital in patient care . Adequate funding . However , has not kept pace with the need for Community programs and treatment"
No," , so , as you can see in the picture , this is a mental health care in Washington . This one is an asylum , modern Asylum , and this one , no is the Davao mental hospital . This is the original um psychiatric facility in Davao City"
No," , however uh recently binagonasha , and we have the spmc IP BM , so remember , class that uh in today 's time , people with mental illness receive treatment in a variety of setting . So I remember class no , that in 1980s in patient psychiatric care was still a"
No," primary mode of treatment for people with mental illness . So we have different treatment settings . We have the inpatient hospital treatment , the partial hospitalization program , the residential settings and the Transitional Care ."
No," So Ayan um under the inpatient hospital treatment , we have the short stay clients , the long stay clients , the case management and the discharge planning . So in the inpatient Hospital settings"
No," class no in the 1980s inpatient psychiatric care was still a primary mode of treatment for people with mental illness . A typical psychiatric unit emphasized talk , therapy or oneonone interactions between residents and staff and Milo therapy , meaning the total"
Environment," environment and its effect on the client 's treatment . So in the individual and group interactions . This focuses on trust selfdisclosure by clients to staff in the one another , and also the active participation in the group"
No," , um treatment or in groups . The effective Melo therapy required long lengths of stay because clients , with more stable conditions , help to provide structure and support for newly admitted clients with more acute conditions , so meaning they can share their experience to the newly"
No," Care exerts , cost control measures such as recertification of admissions , the utilization review and the case management , all of which have altered inpatient treatment significantly . The growth of Managed Care has been"
Environment," This situation has both advantages and disadvantages . Nurses identify the advantages of providing protection against the outside world in a safe and secure environment , as well as the primary disadvantages of making clients feel confined or"
No," days in the hospital , but did improve their selfesteem And feelings of selfcontrol , another alternative available to Veterans is the shortterm acute residential treatment or the start located in nonhospitalbased residential treatment . Centers veterans"
No," treated in a Start program have the same Improvement in symptoms and functioning as those treated in the Veterans Affairs hospital , but are typically more satisfied with the services . So the cost of treatment in a Start program is approximately 65 percent"
No," lower than the treatment in the hospital . Next is we have the long stay clients long stick , clients are people with severe and persistent mental illness who continue to require acute care services . Despite the current emphasis on decreased hospital stays , this population"
No," includes clients who were hospitalized before the institutionalization and remain hospitalized . Despite efforts at Community placement , it also includes clients who have been hospitalized consistently for long periods despite efforts to minimize"
No," their hospital stays . Community placement of clients with problematic behaviors still meets resistance from the public , creating a barrier to successful placement in community settings . So one approach to working with long stay clients is a unit within or near a"
No," others eventually resettle in the community , so the clients with a dual diagnosis um , usually require more frequent or longer hospitalizations than clients , with only a mental illness . Diagnosis , the Dual diagnosis most often refers to"
No, diagnosis . Clients with dual diagnosis are often more difficult to treat due to more complicated problems posed by two different diagnosis . They tend to have higher rates of nonadherence to treatment and poorer longterm outcomes
No," Community settings . In patient case managers are usually nurses or social workers who follow the client from admission to discharge and serve as Liaisons between the client and Community Resources . The home care and third party prayers ; no , so they are"
Environment," um the medication and physical care , Financial organization , coordination of Transport needs and the overseeing the nutritional needs of their clients . So in the community class , no the case manager works with client on a broad range of"
No," issues from um from um , so again , um in the community . The case manager works with clients on a broad range of"
No," issues from accessing need medical and Psychiatric Services to carrying out tasks for daily living , such as using public transportation , managing money and buying groceries . So next we have the discharge planning in discharge planning . No , this is an"
No," important Concept in any inpatient treatment . Setting the environmental supports , such as housing and transportation and access to Community Resources and services are crucial to successful discharge planning discharge plans that are based on the"
Environment," individual clients needs , including medication management , education , timely outpatient appointments and telephone followup are more likely to be successful . In fact , the adequacy of discharge plans is a better predictor of how long the person could remain in the"
No," community than our clinical indicators , such as the psychiatric diagnosis impediments to successful discharge planning includes alcohol and drug abuse , criminal or violent behavior and noncompliance with medication regimens . In the suicidal ideation"
No, valuable attention to psychosocial factors that address the client 's wellbeing his or her preference for followup Services . Inclusion of the family and the familiarity without patient providers is critical to the success of a discharge plan .
Environment, One essential component of the discharge planning is relapse prevention or early recognition of relapse . Education about relapse involves both clients and families or significant others . That is why we are always telling you that the care for clients
Environment," are holistic , meaning we are not just only focusing on the client , but as well as the family and the significant others . So with this , one interventions include symptom Education , Service , continuity and establishment of daily structure , clients and families who can recognize signs of"
No, plan creating a successful discharge plans that offer optimal services and housing is essential if people with mental illness are to be integrated into the community . That is why they are encouraging as well the communitybased um
No," Healthcare um setting . It 'S a community okay , so a holistic approach to reintegrating persons in the community is the best way to prevent repeated Hospital admissions"
Environment," and improve quality of life for clients . Community programs , after discharge from the hospital , should include Social Services , the day treatment and Housing Programs all geared towards survival in the community , compliance with treatment , recommendations , rehabilitations and"
No, independent living . So we have here the assertive Community treatment for the ACT program . This program actually provides many of the services that are necessary to stop the revolving door of repeated Hospital admissions punctuated by unsuccessful
No," attempts at community living . This assertive Community treatment programs can actually a big help to our clients , especially in the community . Next , we have the partial hospitalization"
No," programs , so our phps are designed to help clients make a gradual transition from being in patients to living independently and to prevent repeat admissions . So in a day , treatment programs , clients will turn home at night and for the"
No," evening programs . These are just the reverse of your day : treatment program , foreign , so the services that different phps offer vary , but most programs include groups for building communication and social skills , solving problems"
No," , monitoring medications and learning coping strategies and skills for daily living . Individual sessions are available in some pH , please , as are vocational assistance and occupational and recreational Therapies"
Environment," , so again , class . No individual sessions are available in some page piece as our vocational assistance and occupational and Recreation Therapies . So remember that each client has an individualized treatment plan and goals which the client develops with the case"
No," manager and other members of the treatment team . Clients in phps May complete the program after an inpatient Hospital stay , which is usually too short to address anything other than stabilization of symptoms and medication Effectiveness . Other clients"
Environment," symptoms , um , monitoring , drug Effectiveness , stabilizing living environment , um , improving living environment . I mean improving activities of daily"
No," living learning to structure time . Developing social skills , obtaining um , meaningful work , paid employment or a volunteer position and providing followup of any um health concerns . So the goals of partial hospitalization"
Environment," programs focus on training for social and basic living skills , such as shopping for groceries and planning meals that help clients transition gradually . No , my transition from inpatient to Independent , independently , okay"
No," , facilitating a drug abuse prevention group would be appropriate for a relapse prevention Aftercare program . So that 's your partial hospitalization program . Next is we have the residential settings ? Persons with mental illness may live in"
No," community Residential Treatment , settings That Vary according to structure , level of supervision and services , provided so remember class . No that uh in some settings they are designed as transitional housing , with the expectation that"
No," depends on the um institution or program or a group of companies who offers this type of treatment , okay , treatment setting . So you have your residential setting , so other residential programs"
No," three clients in a familylike atmosphere , including meals and social activities , with a family halfway , houses usually serves as temporal Replacements that provide support as the clients prepare for Independence"
No," , okay , so the staff members are available for Crisis Intervention , the transportation assistance with daily living tasks and sometimes the drug monitoring . In addition to onsite staff . Many residential settings provide Case"
Environment," Management Services for clients and put them in touch with other programs , such as your Vocational Rehabilitation , the medical and dental and the psychiatric care , and psychosocial Rehabilitation , programs or Services as needed . Assisted Living Services are available"
No," that having a group home will decrease their property values and they may believe that people with mental illness are violent , will act bizarrely in public or will be a menace to their children . These people have strongly ingrained stereotypes and a great deal of"
No," educating members of the community , so that 's your residential setting moving forward . We have the Transitional Care in Canada and in Scotland the transitional relationship model - formerly transitional discharge model , has proved"
No," successful . Patients who were discharged to the community after long hospitalizations receive intensive , receive intensive services to facilitate their transition to successful community living and functioning . So there are two essential components of"
No," this model : no , which are peer support and the bridging staff so um in the peer support class . No , in the peer support it is provided by a consumer now living successfully in the community ."
No," Also , we have the bridging staff . It refers to an overlap between hospital and Community Care . Hospital staff do not terminate their therapeutic relationship with the client until a therapeutic relationship has been established with a community care provider ."
Environment," maintaining housing residents often rely on government entitlements , such as the Social Security insurance or the SSDI no for their income and though , although many clients Express the desire to work , many can not do so consistently . So even the vocational Services , the jobs"
Environment," available to tend to be unskilled and parttime , resulting in income that is inadequate to maintain Independent Living . So both psychiatric Rehabilitation , programs and Society must address poverty among people with mental illness"
Environment," , to remove this barrier to independent living and um selfsufficiency foreign . Next we have the psychiatric Rehabilitation recovery . So in the first picture this is a"
Environment," rehabilitation center . The Bandung psychiatric rehabilitation center on the hands . We have the Villa Fairmont mental health Rehabilitation Center , no , a Telecare . We have also this department of health or the Doh drug abuse , treatment and"
Environment," Rehabilitation Center in bukidnon foreign and the Davao City , Treatment and rehabilitation center for drug dependence located in Turok , 7 Bago oshiro to book District , Davao City , so psychiatric Rehabilitation"
Environment," , sometimes uh cold . As your psychosocial Rehabilitation refers to Services designed to promote the recovery process for clients with mental illness , no , so the following are the goals of psychiatric Rehabilitation . We have the recovery from mental illness"
No," , personal growth , achieving quality of life , the community integration , clients , empowerment , clients , increase Independence , decrease Hospital admissions , improve social functioning and Vocational functioning , The Continuous treatment , The increased"
No," involvement in treatment decisions , improve physical health and recovered sense of self . So the recovery goes beyond symptom control and medication management to include the personal growth or integration into the community , the"
No," , um , as I mentioned , accepting illness managing symptoms effectively being actively engaged in the community having meaningful social contact . Coping with family relationships and valuing self and others so remember . Class know that the"
Environment," organization must make a commitment to ongoing quality improvement , provide necessary resources and technological support and reward creative thinking . The work environment needs to anticipate , manage and celebrate change for a recovery culture to flourish ."
Environment," Community Support programs and services provide psychiatric Rehabilitation to varying degrees , often depending on the resources and the funding available . So with our Doh facility , they are depending no . The their budget depends on the national uh budget provided by the"
Environment," Doh , so some programs Focus primarily on reducing Hospital admissions through symptom control and medication management . We have also nowhere , as others include social and Recreation services and too"
Environment, few programs are available Nationwide to meet the needs of people with mental illness . The psychiatric Rehabilitation has improved client outcomes by providing Community Support Services to decrease Hospital readmission rates and increase
No," Community integration . At the same time , Managed Care has reduced the medically necessary services that are funded , okay , so clients and providers identified poverty , lack of jobs and inadequate vocational skills as barriers to"
Environment, community integration . But because these barriers were not included in the medical and necessary definition of psychiatric Rehabilitation by managed care services to overcome these barriers were not being funded . So another aspect of psychiatric
Environment," Rehabilitation and Recovery is the involvement , no involvement of peer counselors or consumer providers . Programs employing peers , found Improvement in client functioning satisfaction with programming , selfconfidence and hope for recovery ."
Environment," provided who share daytoday coping strategies connected them to peers and shared experiences of medication , use and seeking mental health care peer . Counselors can also be part of more structured delivery of services , which includes the education about"
No," illness , recovery , medication and services . Topics of Hope , selflove , pleasure and finding happiness and responding to crisis calls . So an added benefit of peer counseling is the peer counselor pursuing their own recovery by giving back or making"
No," meaningful contribution to one 's community . Thank you so , next class we have this . What socalled Clubhouse model so in the clubhouse model ? No um . In 1948 The Fountain House Pioneer"
Environment," the clubhouse model of communitybased Rehabilitation in New York City , so there are 300 clubhouses in 33 countries worldwide and numerous related programs based on Fountain house or the clubhouse principles . So the fountain house is an intentional"
No," Community , Based on the belief that men and women with serious and persistent psychiatric disabilities can and will achieve normal life goals when given opportunity , time support and fellowship . So the essence of membership in the clubhouse is based on the four"
No," Members are encouraged and assisted to use Psychiatric Services , which are usually local clinics or the private practitioner . The clubhouse model recognizes the physicianclient relationship as a key to successful treatment and"
Environment," Rehabilitation , while acknowledging that Brief Encounters that focus on symptom management are not sufficient to promote Rehabilitation efforts . The rehabilitation Alliance refers to the network of relationships that must develop over time to support people with"
Environment," psychiatric disabilities and includes the client , family , friends , clinicians and even landlords , employers and Neighbors . The rehabilitation Alliance needs Community Support opportunities for Success , coordination of service providers and member involvement ."
Environment," Involvement to maintain a positive focus on life goals , strengths , creativity and hope . As the members pursue recovery , the clubhouse model exists to promote the rehabilitation Alliance as a positive force in the members lives . So the clubhouse focus is on health , not"
No," the illness , taking prescribed drugs , for example . No is not a condition of participation in the clubhouse members . Not staff must ultimately make decisions about treatment such as whether or not they need hospitalization or hospital"
Environment," Rehabilitation is the Cornerstone and the strength of the club house model . Next , we have the assertive Community treatment so in the assertive Community treatment . This is one of the most effective approaches to communitybased treatment"
Environment," for people with mental illness marks test and stain 1973 . No because he have this idea in Madison Wisconsin , while working at Mendota state hospital , they believe that skills , skills , training , support and"
Environment, teaching should be done in the community where it was needed rather than in the hospital . This program was first known as the Madison model and then um training in community living
No," and finally , the art or the assertive Community treatment . So this uh , the mobile Outreach and continuous treatment programs of today all have their notes in the Madison models"
No," existing a program or treatment programs . It was rooted from this Madison model . Okay , so um an act program has a problem problem . Solving orientation staff members attend to specific life issues , no matter how"
No," mundane assertive communication treatment programs provide most Services directly rather than relying on referrals to other programs or agencies , and they implement the services in the clients , homes or communities , not in offices ."
No," , we have the multidisciplinary team um , identifying fixed point of responsibilities , ameliorating or eliminating the debilitating symptoms of mental illness . Improving client functioning decreasing the family 's burden of care , implementing"
No," an individualized , ongoing treatment programs involving all needed support systems , promoting Mental Health emphasizing and promoting client Independence . Using daily team meetings , providing Services 24 hours a day and measuring clients , outcomes"
No," , okay , so that 's the components of an act program . So next we have the technology , the telepsychiatry , the telemental , health and emental health are a few terms used to describe Mental Health Services"
No," Services exist . Lack of funding to provide only that Services , client reluctance to go to an established hospital or clinic feeling such as fear , anxiety or mistrust , difficulty navigating the system and long wait times in offices or clinics ."
Environment," shelters , Rehabilitation , programs and prisons may serve as makeshift alternatives to inpatient care or Supportive Housing . So frequent shifts between the street programs and institutions will send the marginal existence of this population"
No," compared with homeless people without mental illness mentally ill homeless . People are homeless , longer , spend more time in shelters , have fewer contacts with family and spend more time in jail and face greater barriers to employment ."
No," Persons reported that being homeless and having a mental illness was the basis for or of discrimination than the color of their skin . For this population professionals supersedes families as the primary source of Health , okay"
Environment," significantly alter the prognosis of homelessness for persons with mental illnesses , the psychosocial rehabilitation services , the peer support , vocational training and daily living skill training are all important components for decreasing"
No," given community . However , with no other services , this individuals remain socially isolated and did n't participate in the community . The interventions designed to improve social relationships and Community activity were necessary to improve their quality"
No," of life . The center for mental health services initiated the access to Community Care and effective services and support demonstration project in 1994 . That 'S your access , okay ! This is to assess whether more"
No," Factors cited as reasons that mentally ill people are placed in the criminal justice system includes the institutionalization , the more rigid criteria for civil commitment , the lack of adequate Community Support"
No," , economizing on treatment for mental illness and attitude of police and the society as well criminalization of mental Illness refers to the practice of arresting and Prosecuting mentally ill offenders , even for misdemeanors , at a rate four times"
No," than of the general population , in an effort to contain them in some time of institution where they might receive needed treatment . However , if offenders with mental illness have obtained needed treatment , some might not have engaged in criminal"
No," be some of the 350 000 prisoners with a serious mental illness , so this population more rightfully , belongs in the mental health system , with the treatment structure and support needed to address their multiple needs . This will require increased funding and"
No," the criminal justice system face several barriers to successful community reintegration . So this includes the poverty , the homelessness , the substance , use , violence , victimization , rape and Trauma , and the selfharm"
No," so remember class know that some communities have mobile crisis Services linked to their police departments . These professionals are called to the scene , no um after the situation has been stabilized when police officers believe mental health issues are involved ."
Environment," So often , this uh same professionals provide education to police , to help them recognize mental illness and perhaps change their attitude about mentally ill offenders . Detecting mental illness among detainees of inmates can be problematic . Mental"
No," health screening is often performed by law enforcement Personnel , meaning it involves the use of a screening tool that is brief and easy to administer . Yet it 's accurate , it is accurate , so tools that are readily available for use in mental health screening includes"
No, includes the brief jail mental health screening and the correctional mental health screens not which are available for both men and women . It would be also useful if such a screening tool was a standard part of jail admission and intake
No," the posttraumatic stress disorder or the PTSD and major depression among active duty military service members is greater than their civilian counterparts . There is also an increased rate of suicide twice , that of civilians . There is also this homicide , injury and physical"
No," illness . The number of deployments , especially three or more , is positively correlated with the PTSD depression , bipolar disorder and anxiety disorders . Also , common are Sleep Disorders , substance use , cardiovascular disease , smoking homelessness and martial and"
No, family dysfunction . So military veterans have problems with all the issues listed above no uh many times . Veterans may be reluctant to seek treatment or find the treatment is n't readily available . Dealing with the stigma or perceived stigma of mental
No," than most would think and can affect both male and female veterans . It is associated with even greater risk for PTSD depression , anxiety , Eating Disorders , substance , use , sleep disorders and suicide , so Ayan class"
No," um the benefits no from involvement in therapeutic Life , Changes Beyond diagnosis and treatment of the mental disorder , and so we need to um"
Environment," address the following . The diet , the exercise , relaxation , the Stress Management , Recreation and the spirituality , so we have the interdisciplinary team . No . In the interdisciplinary team class we have the uh"
Environment," , the nurses , The Physician , the pharmacies , the psychiatrists , psychologists , um , social worker , the OT , the recreation therapist and The Vocational Rehabilitation . Um specialists yeah"
Environment," so , regardless of the treatment setting rehabilitation program or population , an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary team approach is most useful in dealing with the multifacet um problems of clients with mental illness . Different members of the team"
Environment," , psychiatric nurse , the psychiatric social worker , the OT RT or the recreation therapies and The Vocational Rehabilitation specialist . So functioning as an effective team member requires the development and"
Environment," assessment and risk management skills , so remember , class . Not that the role of the case manager has become increasingly important , with the proliferation of managed care and the variety of services that clients need no standard , formal education program to"
Environment," become a case manager exists . However , a people from many different backgrounds may feel this role in some settings . A social worker or psychiatric nurse may be the case manager in other settings . People who work in psychosocial Rehabilitation settings may take on the"
Environment," advocacy skills to be more successful with their clients . So these clinical skills includes your treatment , planning , symptom and functional assessment and skills training . The relationship skills include the ability to establish and maintain"
Environment," Rehabilitation . Now now so these are the interdisciplinary team primary roles Ayan . We have the pharmacist , no um this , that they are the member of the"
No," , um RNs , who obtain master 's degree in mental health , may be certified as clinical Specialists or licensed as advanced practitioners , depending on individual State nurse Practice Act . We have also the psychiatric a psychiat psychiatric social worker , no"
Environment," prepared at the Master 's level or are licensed in some states . The occupational therapies we have the recreation therapist and your Vocational Rehabilitation Therapies . So remember , class know that as clients needs become more varied and complex . The"
Environment," psychiatric problems . They can administer drugs , monitor for drug side effects , provide drug and client and family a health education and monitor for General medication disorders that have psychological and physiological components ."
Environment," psychiatric patients , you can monitor the drug side effects , tapos health , education and you can monitor for General Medical disorders , us foreign , but in the Philippines"
Environment," Public Health nurses working in the community provides mental health Prevention Services to reduce risks to the mental health of persons , families and communities . So examples includes primary prevention , such as stress management , education ."
Environment," We have the secondary prevention , such as the early identification of potential mental health problems and the treasury prevention , such as monitoring and coordinating rehabilitation services for mentally ill , so the clinical practice of Public"
No," Health and Home Care nurses includes caring for clients and families with issues such As the substance abuse , the domestic violence um , the child abuse grief and depression . In addition , Public Health nurses , care for children in schools and teach"
No," health related subjects to community groups and agencies , Mental Health Services that public health and Home Care nurses provide can actually reduce the suffering that many people experience as a result of physical"
No," diseases , mental disorders , social And emotional disadvantages and other vulnerabilities so class , as you can see in the pictures , these are those clients , NASA mental health facility , known America"
No," , so mental health programs delivered electronically , no have a strong evidence base of providing clinical , effective and costeffective services to persons who are often underserved yet are underused uh by practitioners . This includes persons living in more remote or rural"
Environment," areas , areas of limited available Services , problems traveling to services or reluctance to access Mental Health Services in a public way . Clinicians in Australia . Both mental health and general practice participated in education programs about the"
Environment," um use of the eservices for clients , with anxiety and depression with positive outcomes , so Ayan . No . The next step is expansion of services to other countries and for other disorders and problems . Education"
No," mental health nursing is evolving no as changes continue in our health care and the Healthcare System . The focus is shifting from traditional hospitalbased goals of symptoms and medication , management to more clientcentered goals , which includes improved quality of life"
No," meet them . Mental Health Services um are moving into some nontraditional settings , such as jails and homeless , shelters as nursing roles expand in these"
No," , which can be unsettling empowering clients to make their own decisions about treatment is an essential part of full recovery . This differs from the model of the psychiatrist or treatment team , as the"
No," authority on what is the best course for the client to follow . It is a challenge for the nurse to be supportive of the client , when the nurse believes that the client has made choices that are less than ideal . The nurse may experience frustration"
No," , a clients move toward recovery . They need support to make decisions and follow a course of action , even if the nurse thinks that the client is making decisions that are unlikely to be successful . Working with clients in community"
No," No . On the topic being mentioned , the treatment setting and therapeutic programs . So thank you for listening and have a nice day ahead"
No," myself in good physical health , good , mental and emotional health and good spiritual health . I am not a doctor or a mental health specialist , but all of these ideas that i 'm going to give are just my"
No," own opinions and things that help me , and i hope that some of these ideas will be helpful to you as well . So , let 's start off with physical health , like i said before , i 'm going to mention a few things and not delve really deep into them . So"
No," i will just let you guys do your own research on how you want to do it , but here are some ideas that that i think increase physical health . I think it 's important to get enough sleep . Do research"
Environment," on your age group because i know it differs for each one but see how much sleep you should be getting or that the health professionals recommend and follow that as closely as possible , get enough exercise and physical"
Environment," activity and when you can do it outside . So that you can get some vitamin d and breathe some fresh air , you can do things in your own home . If you want , you can go to the gym . You can get"
Environment," some of those resistance bands online and do a whole bunch of workouts from home , but there are so many ways to exercise and do physical activity . Another thing to focus on if you 're , trying to improve your physical health"
No," is to have a good , balanced diet . Make sure that you are having moderation and that you are having enough protein , that you 're mixing enough vegetables and fruits and healthy fats and things like that and"
No," feel physically , it can make you feel drained . So , that 's why i recommend balancing out your diet and your nutrition and making sure that you 're getting enough of each of the different food groups"
Environment," so for your physical health make sure you get enough sleep enough exercise , drink enough water , get a balanced diet and try to Get enough vitamin d from the sun so that you feel well now for mental and emotional health ."
No," laugh read about what chemicals are released and what it actually does , and i think you 'll be really surprised because it 's very beneficial . I have a motto in my family that says zero drama and zero stress , and so , if you want to improve your"
No," beautiful landscape pictures that are in this video were taken by my wife . That 'S something that relaxes her . So i encourage it and if that helps you out go , do it so remember for your mental and emotional"
No," and one way that i recommend doing , that is by having faith in something there are so many different beliefs out there . But if you believe in something that will in my mind , that will help immensely , if you believe in god"
No," or if you believe in energy or whatever , you believe in just believe in something and have faith in that a lot of people increase their spiritual health . By praying , some people"
No, peaceful place like that and you look around and you see all of the beauty that god or A supreme being created for us also some people when they go to church . It helps them to feel a lot better spiritually .
No," So that 's one thing that you could do a lot of times : they talk about positive messages at church that talk about overcoming trials or trying to overcome some difficulty , and that is very motivating for some people"

Environment, as playing golf and tennis since her concussion . She has not been participating in any sports or vigorous exercise as she gets frequent headaches and fatigues quickly due to her lack of sleep . She also used to enjoy reading watching television and playing cards
No," with friends , but now these activities give her migraines she still enjoys taking long walks outside when the weather is n't too cold . Lastly , Denise mentioned that since her accident , she has not been able to return to work . This is because she is unable to"
No," fill her job demands as a result of decreased tolerance to computer screens and mobile devices , regardless she 's hoping to return to work parttime in a few months . But unfortunately , her employer is unaccommodating to her injury , making the transition back more"
No," difficult and stressful . The who call breath was selected for Denis , based on the challenges mentioned during her clinical interview during the initial interview , Denis Express limited social support , as well as symptoms of depression and anxiety . Multiple studies"
Environment," well with outcome measures of concussion such as Glasgow Coma Scale and has been frequently used in traumatic brain injury . Samples to inform occupation related intervention , the hoof wall breast has shown very good responsiveness towards measuring the"
No," questionnaire with you is that something you 'd be interested in hearing a little more about okay , okay . So the questionnaire that I was thinking of is called the World Health Organization . Quality of life questionnaire brief version . I mean , as the title says , it"
Environment," measures your quality of life . It would only take about 10 minutes to complete is that something you 'd be okay to do today . Sure , okay , so Denise before you fill in the actual assessment , there 's just a short survey to fill it above . You on your gender date of birth education"
No," understand anything , let me know and just take your time if you have any questions before you begin , I do n't think so . Okay , the who fall brief is a 26 item questionnaire that assesses selfreported quality of life across four domains : physical health"
Environment," , psychological wellbeing , social relationships and environment . Each domain is considered to encompass different facets , for instance the physical health domain incomes as the following activities of daily living dependence on medicinal substances and"
No," medical aids , energy and fatigue , mobility , pain and discomfort , sleep and rest and work capacity . The psychological wellbeing domain encompasses body , image and appearance , negative feelings and positive feelings , self esteem , spirituality and personal beliefs"
Environment," , thinking learning memory and concentration . The social relationships can incorporates personal relationships , social support and sexual activity . Finally , the environment environment dimension includes financial resources"
Environment," , freedom , physical safety and security , and health and social care , home environment opportunities for acquiring new information and skills , participation in and opportunities for , recreation and leisure activities . Physical environment , such as pollution , noise , traffic , climate"
Environment," and transport . The client responds according to a fivepoint Likert scale , ranging from not at all to completely . The client is asked to think about their perception of quality of life within the past two weeks , keeping in mind their standards , hopes"
Environment," therapists begin by writing down each raw score items . Three four and twenty six on the questionnaire I reverse scored . The questionnaire is divided into four domains : physical , psychological , social relations and environment for each domain . Raw scores are added"
No," actually able to draw some helpful conclusions based on your results , I 'm Hoping that we could use these to sort of help with our overall assessment and treatment plan moving forward , so there are four major categories of quality of life according to this questionnaire , so"
Environment," for the environment category you scored a 75 out of 100 to me . What that indicates is that you 're mostly satisfied with your physical environment where you live , would you say that 's true , I would say that 's true . I I like where I live and I feel safe in my own okay , so"
Environment," the only pieces here that seems to be more problematic has to do with finances and things like the opportunity to participate in leisure activities and access to transportation . Could you elaborate a little more on these ideas for me ? Well , I want to mentioned before"
No," driving is very difficult for me . I get very anxious and I was quite far outside of the city . So if we can find ways to minimize my driving anxiety , it would be very helpful . Definitely , I think , that 's an area where we could work together , okay and as far as the finances go . I"
No," with 38 of the 100 , so this has to do with your sleep and energy and daily life activities and your capacity for work . Could you talk a little bit about that for me ? Well , those all sound like areas . I want to improve I 'm not surprised by the"
No," In a few months we can see if there have been any improvements or any sort of changes over those months , so that would be helpful . So , finally , I 'm the two other domains here are psychological and social relationship . So you 've got some moderate scores here . It seems that"
No," things seem to be going quite well when it comes to things like selfesteem or positive and negative feelings , concentration , social relationships and sexual activity . So there is some room for improvement , but overall things seem to be going . Okay , would you agree with"
No," that ? I mean the advice , I have friends , I had family and you have a good support system but , as I told you I just wish , I could participate in more activities with with my friends and family and my concentration . It used to be pretty good before the concussion , but since I smile"
No," it 's really hard to concentrate - and I think it has impacted my selfesteem for sure - and maybe my quality of life and I 'm very anxious to return to work . As you know , and my boss - and I did not have a good working relationship right now - so these are all things that I want to"
No," work . Part time . Three days per week by the beginning of June , is that correct ? Yes , it would , but I did always in the questionnaire . There were no questions that related directly to work . Yes , what is true on the questionnaire and was sort of more of an evaluation"
No," for your capacity for work in terms of your perception of your physical and mental health ? At the moment , there is over a longer , more inclusive version of the questionnaire with 100 questions . When we could use that it 's moving forward , we feel it 's necessary to gather"
No," health care settings . It 'S been used with samples in many health conditions , including stroke , Parkinson 's disease , cancer , older adults , arthritis mood disorders , acquired brain injuries , schizophrenia and asthma . There are also multiple variations and shortened"
No," versions of this tool , such as the specialized HIV scale and spirituality , religiousness and personal belief scale . Making its desirable go to quality of life assessment tool , there are no normative values for the who progress as an individual scores , are interpreted"
Environment," who qua breath is that it has been validated cross . Culturally , formal training is recommended for scoring and interpretation purposes . However , minimal training is required for administration of the tool . Studies that have implemented the whole qual brass"
Environment," Reviewer: Queenie Lee Intimacy, security, respect, good communication, a sense of being valued. These are some of the things that most people would agree make for healthy relationships. And researchers would agree, too. There is a large body of literature on romantic relationships"
Environment," It's call premarital education. And this is a good idea: teach people how to have a good relationship while they are still happy, presumably. And it can work. But in my opinion, it's still too late. Why?"
Environment," Because people have already selected the person they want to commit their life to. What if they selected poorly? No amount of premarital education can make up for a bad partner choice. So the ways we have tried to teach people how to have healthy relationships have been limited, because they fail to address three important things:"
No," we think they really can help people with all the different parts of the relationship process, and with all different people whether people in a relationship or not. So let me tell you about the skills. The first one is insight. Insight is about awareness, and understanding, and learning. So with insight, you'll have a better idea of who you are, what you need,"
No," that increases the likelihood that you'll get them met. Let's say you have to go to a really stressful family event, and you'd like your partner to be there with you. You might say directly: ""You know this is going to be stressful for me. I'd really love for you to be there; you'll be a really good buffer for me."
Environment," Is there any way you can clear your schedule to come with me?"" With mutuality, you'll be willing to meet your partner's needs as well. Let's say you know that your partner really likes to go to the gym first thing in the morning, it makes your partner feel better the rest of the day. Mutuality will let you be willing to support your partner in this,"
No," they could trust people, they weren't worried about being rejected. Girls who are more romantically competent reported fewer depressive symptoms, they had better mental health. They also were more positive about their expectations about marriage in the future; they were more optimistic that it could go well. Girls with greater romantic competence"
No," So, even at an early age, 13 and 14 years old, when these girls mostly were not even in relationships, the more romantically competent they were, the more adaptive relational functioning they were showing, and the better mental health they were showing. We see the same things among young adults, 18 to 25 years old: More romantically competent men and women feel more secure in relationships."
No," And this isn't just what they told us, we actually observed them doing this in our laboratory, where we asked them to talk with one another about a personal problem. Young people who were more romantically competent also were more satisfied in their relationships, they were happier. And again, they reported fewer depressive symptoms"
No," and also fewer anxiety symptoms. So overall, being romantically competent at a young age is associated with greater, more adaptive relationship functioning and greater individual well being. And this brings me back to my point that we need to be teaching people how to have healthy relationships."
Environment," like fighting, and poor support, and hostility, and criticism, and contempt, and violence. And create the things that lead to healthy relationships, like intimacy, security, respect, good communication, and a sense of being valued. And wouldn't all of our relationships benefit from this? I think they would."
Environment," less because blood flows easier when it does n't have to overcome gravity , but on the other hand , if you 're exercising you are putting a tremendous demand on your body , you 're increasing demand of blood flow and nutrient delivery . So you have to increase your heart rate . You have to increase your blood pressure , it 's appropriate when you 're exercising so during intense exercise . You could actually have 220 in blood pressure , and that is normal , so blood pressure is created and it is dependent on the situation ."
Environment," The second thing to understand is that exercise is a form of stress . Stress increases the demand on the body and when we have stress it 's a matter of balance between what 's called your sympathetic and your parasympathetic nervous system . So those are big words . What does that mean ? They'Re also known as white flight sympathetic is fight , flight and parasympathetic is known as feed breed or rest digest , and what these are . It is your autonomic nervous system , the automatic portion of your nervous system"
Environment," available for your digestion , your system and your healing . So you can defend yourself , you can stress , or you can heal you just ca n't do both at the same time you got ta pick one so number three thing to understand is that there are different types of stress . Exercise is physical stress , but we also have what most people talk about when they say stress is emotional stress . So in a sense we could say that exercise is very appropriate stress , but emotional stress is sort of imaginary stress . It 'S not really a stress that demands a lot of"
Environment," physical exertion , but your nervous system responds that way . Just in case , it 's gon na increase your heart rate , your blood pressure , your blood glucose , your cortisol , even if you 're just sitting in traffic and cursing the gridlock and the traffic jam . When you 're getting stressed your body acts as if it 's a physical stress just in case , and if we want to narrow down what emotional stress is in the simplest possible way . The simplest way to describe it is to say that emotional stress is thoughts about the unwanted . Whenever you 're thinking about"
No," biggest things there is and we 'll try it in just a second here . But we you pay attention to your breath . You can no longer at the same time , think about what unwanted try it . If you 're stressed you have thinking about the kids or the deadlines , and then you pay attention to your breath , then for just a fleeting moment . You did n't think about that out of the thing , and that is like I said , may seem like a small thing , but that is an incredibly powerful principle that you 're no longer doing that thing . That keeps you in your state of emotional"
No," stress and if you do enough of that , you can break the pattern and now that we break the pattern , we need to understand what neuroplasticity is so a lot of people . They say : oh yeah , I tried your breathing and it felt great . I did it three months ago . I tried it once and I did it for five minutes and I felt great , but the next day it was the same thing over and they 're , not understanding the principle of neuroplasticity they 're , not understanding the principle of habit and momentum . It do n't be like the person who says : oh diets , do n't work , I ate a carrot"
Environment," , they become larger pathways , and if you do it enough , it becomes a superhighway that has traffic on it , whether you think about it Or not , this is exactly the principle . That 'S in place when you 're righthanded versus lefthanded . Okay , do you think someone tells you to to write something down and you grab your pen in your preferred hand , and you just start writing without thinking , but if they tell you to switch hands all of a sudden , you have no idea what to do . You have to focus intensely and it 's gon na go super slow and it 's not going to be pretty . Why"
No," is because you you do n't know how ? No you , you understand , the mechanics but you 'd have n't developed the skill , the pathway . Isn'T there , the neuro motor patterns are n't developed . Another way of thinking about that is like a concert pianist just because you 'd practice on the piano for five minutes does n't mean you know how to play piano . But if you play a few hours every day for twenty years , all of a sudden you can play and have a conversation at the same time , you 've developed so many pathways that it 's going on automatic ."
No," start Noticing results very very soon , but if you stop , then the habit goes away . So I would say , set your goal to do it for at least six months , because if you do it six months , you 're , probably in the habit that you 'll keep doing it forever and once you have that kind of habit . Once you have that pattern , chances are that you will even start breathing you 'll even get into that emotional state when you 're , not thinking about it , it becomes your norm , regardless of where you are . You can do it in in school . You can be that way in business meetings and"
No," You are rewiring all of you , so what you will find is that sure your blood pressure will go down , but so will your cortisol and so will your insulin resistance and your circulation will improve . So you all of a sudden you end up with warm hands . You'Re in your digestion , will improve . You will get more nutrients out of your food . We spent all of our time talking about what to eat , but how do we digest it ? Well , we digest it by activating our parasympathetic nervous system immune function to have fewer colds and flus you heal better ."
No," six months . So do n't stop after a week , because when you 're doing this you 're sending more blood to the frontal lobe and to the cortex of your brain , you also are probably going to notice that your focus gets better . Your memory gets better and the list is endless pretty much anything you want , you can put it on that list and if you get your sympathetic and parasympathetic imbalance , it 's gon na improve . So , even though this is a video about how to lower blood pressure , I want you to start looking at the bigger picture of"
No," thank you and i think , let 's start hey , sir , please god so uh in this group uh . I hope all of you are now familiar with"
No," , somehow religiosity and spirituality tend to be pushed right right to the last . Whereas you see , because when you 're talking of death or when you 're talking of suffering"
No," our happiness , our sorrows , everything is generated , our fears , everything is generated from our mind . So what we need is some some level of control of our mind . Some level of mind , control , or rather , what we need is some level of"
No," come and - and you know , take you uh conquer you . So what happens is that you are catastrophizing . You keep on thinking how death will be or how pain , painful"
No," the whole experience can be . A very simple example is that most of you are vaccinated by now the covet vaccination right . So most of you , when you have gone to take the vaccination , you would be thinking of the pain of the needle of"
No," the pain of the injection . But actually what your mind is catastrophizing , what your mind is actually projecting the pain to be when you actually take the injection . You feel that no , i was just thinking in such bad terms . It 'S not it 's just a mild , you"
No," , is very much true in today 's lecture itself . In this whole series , you see , spirituality and religiousity has been pushed to the very end , because you see medical persons do not consider these"
No," things to be very important . In spite of the fact that i am a doctor , i 'm a medical doctor and but i have learned the hard way you see , i 've learned the hard way and i 've learned from my patients - and i am now convinced that spirituality"
No," you had a little child and you used to fall sick , you used to have high fever and all and your mother would take your head in her lap and gently . You know gently soothe on you and run her fingers uh through your hair"
No," , the scientific community will say . Oh that 's just my fluke . No , it was not my fluke . It was because of her intention . That was her intention to provide a sense of comfort , compassion and healing not treating ."
No," troubling questions of a transcendental nature , about the meaning ? What is the meaning of life ? Why am i alive ? What is the value ? What i mean ? Who is going to look after me about values and relationships right"
No," , you know providing him some degree of comfort , but what is more important if you focus on the Background , you see , photographs of family extended family and photographs of various religious figures gods , and these become so important . These"
No," time , the physician 's own belief system , whether spiritual , religious or none , affects medical decision making , consciously or unconsciously . So again , as i said"
No," that , if you 're treating physician or does not have any belief in spiritual or religious issues , then you are going to have a tough time . Believe me"
No, right and i was in the same boat around 15 years back and 15 years back then i made a conscious decision to step into the other boat of spirituality
No," the visible light , that does not mean that 98 is missing . 98 . Is also there it 's just that we ca n't see it . It is something akin to this image and if you , if you are familiar with hinduism and this"
Environment," So we need to understand that , just by science , just by the socalled uh modern ways of uh , you know education . We can not become educated"
No," , which does not mean that 98 percent is Absent 98 percent is still there and as uh rabbi , abraham heshel said it is a grievous mistake to keep a wall of separation between medicine and religion . Right . It 'S a grievous"
No," beautiful slide . This was a little girl was , as i said , she 's no more now , and you can see this huge growth , there 's a large tumor in her upper arm and she used to come with the mother ."
No," she is having a lot of pain and this and that and we used to treat her with pain , medications and everything . And one day i decided that no enough is enough . I have to communicate with this girl and i spent half an hour half an hour . I sat with that little girl and i brought her"
No," and all these days then , i thought that i was thinking in terms of physical suffering of this Girl , i thought that the girl was in distress because of her own physical pain , but no , what this little girl was more agonized"
No," population , but somehow our scientific world does n't believe in religion and spirituality and all those things all religions believe that god or a superior force can intervene for the prevention and treatment of illness as a"
No," response To personal prayer , meditation reading of sacred sacred texts or healing services , some groups emphasize dependence on prayer with advice not to take medical treatment . Also"
No," are issues which are much beyond the ream of science . There are so many things which science can not always explain , but those do happen and those do promote healing as well . Now , what exactly is this religion ?"
No," Religion is a structured belief system that addresses universal spiritual questions like we are all now . We have 40 participants in our group right now and if these 40 participants we get together and we decide okay , now we will pray to this xyz figure"
No," and we will call it god or whatever it is , and we will follow form a . We are now from forming a group , and these are our rules and regulations , so we form a religion now . So that is how religion was formed . Religion is always manmade"
No," , we make it . It is corporate group based structured system and organized system , so religion is something which is manmade . We make it , whereas spirituality . What is spirituality spirituality is anything which gives you"
No," anything which gives you a sense of meaning and purpose in life . That is spirituality , like maybe you love your children . For you , your children is your spirituality , someone loves their dog"
No," , their pet gives them spirituality . A sense of spiritual . This thing , spirituality and religiosity do not do not mean the same thing . You can be spiritual , everybody is"
No," right . Religion is something which is added on to you , because that is manmade , but spirituality is within you . It is built in so what is that spirituality is anything which gives you"
No," gentleman with ca lung and he had pain , but we treated his pain , but the problem was : he would never be comfortable alone right . This is his wife in this sorry and"
No," to the extent that he never wanted to be alone . Whenever his wife used to go to the washroom , she had to leave the door open . This man was so scared , and this is his daughter . His daughter was married off"
No," and he had a son also , and the son had a fight with his father and the son was now living separately . Now this gentleman he had this sense of fear he had so that he would not let his wife out of his sight ."
No, So gradually we came to know from him over a period of time the reason of his fear . He was a hindu and in hinduism it is believed that if the sun gives fire to his father 's uh
No," , you know if his father , if his son lights the fire of his father , then the father would go to heaven . This is a belief in hinduism , so this man , when he was confronted with his own mortality . Now he was terrified that see . Look . I have my son has fought"
No," So this was his religious pain . This was the source of his religious pain . Okay , so then we went . We talked to his son . We negotiated with him and finally , the son and father ."
No," doses of morphine or other sedatives and all to take away his fear . That fear will not go away . That fear , because that fear was a religious fear and that could only be alleviated by"
No," you , know , negotiations and something beyond which were something beyond medications . Now , what is the role of religion in palliative care they serve ? Two prime functions first is"
No," to provide a set of core beliefs about life events , provision of a set of core beliefs about life events and to establish establishment of an ethical foundation for clinical decision making right . So many might believe that um , you"
No," know , say dying in a if it comes to dying in a hospital or dying at home or how you really want to die . Those can be influenced by your religious beliefs like jehovah 's witness . They do n't want a blood transcription come what they would ."
No," They would be refusing blood transfusions . So that 's that religious belief and those little beliefs need to be respected right , so religion . What are the good things about religion ?"
No," Religion , helps to cope with . Stress . Studies have shown that 9 out of 10 hospitalized patients use religion to cope over 40 percent , say it keeps them going . It acts as a buffer against depression and speeds recovery from emotional"
No," disturbances . It is associated with positive emotions and good quality of life actually related to lower rates of alcoholism , drugs crime and actually gives better school grades . So it makes sense"
No," to tell your children to be religious because they would have good school grades , and this is these are backed up by scientific evidences scientific evidence in terms of statistical records ."
No," Religion is related to healthier lifestyles and fewer risky behaviors . So many good things about religion . Now you see lower rates of hospitalization and longterm care , greater marital stability in religious"
No," persons compared to persons compared to atheists , enhanced family relationships , more social support , because if you have a religious group , you tend to give social support to your own religious group . So more social support actually"
No," done in a christian based society in the us and older adults , particularly women who attended religious service at least once a week , appear to have a survival advantage over Those attending less frequently"
No," And that is not a joke . Right now religious coping , what what is this religious coping now suppose you are faced with a terminal , illness or any catastrophic event in your life . So how does religion help you to cope ?"
No," Efforts to understand and deal with life stresses in ways related to the sacred , because every religion has their own guidelines in terms of talking about suffering , the cause of suffering and the ways to overcome that suffering ."
No," It serves multiple functions , search for meaning , identity , intimacy control . It is multimodal as well , it involves various behaviors emotions relationships that are said . Every religion has its own guidelines about how you should conduct"
No," photograph was taken , she passed away and uh . She was also catastrophizing , and then we used religion to sort of convince her and sort of stabilize her so that she could come to terms"
No," senior citizens they come over from calcutta , and then this is how we sort of celebrate life , because life needs to be celebrated . Now here is another example of meaning making meaning making . Here it was not religion ; here it was"
No," spirituality in the previous example , which i gave you that was about religion , how religion helped that gentleman to cope who had fought with his son right , so his son came back and finally , he could light his father 's pyre"
No," , and This example is now about spirituality and , as you see this lady , this lady , obviously you see she 's . She was very sick with a large ovarian tumor . She used to live in tripura agarthala"
No," , and this is her daughter . Her daughter was pregnant at that time and this lady . She wanted to hold her granddaughter before she died . That was her wish , and that was her spirituality ."
No," she passed away peacefully . This was her spirituality . This had nothing to do with religion . You see , but this was her wish . This was her spiritual wish that she should that i should hold my"
No," now . How would you know that your patient is having spiritual suffering ? So what are the signs or symptoms by which you would start suspecting that your patient perhaps has spiritual suffering , pain , constant and chronic ? You are giving"
No," all possible pain medications , but still your patient is saying no , sir . I still am having pain . No , i can not sleep at night . No , i am always crying . I do n't like it . I do n't want to live so pain , constant , chronic insomnia . Can not sleep"
No," withdrawal , depression , sense of guilt , selfloathing ? Oh , i am very bad . Basically , i am a very bad person . That is why , god is punishing me , that sort of you know feelings or having conflict he 's fighting with everybody fighting with the family . If i 'm fighting"
No," with the palliative team fighting with friends a sense of hopelessness - oh nothing can happen to me . I am doomed , i am doomed to die that sort of sense , lack of sense of humor , a sense of unforgiving , forgivingness"
No," despair , fear dread . So these things , when you see in a person you start thinking in terms of spiritual or religious suffering , everybody all of us have universal spiritual and existential needs like the need for love . Everybody wants to be"
No," right . So the question comes : is that will we die in a manner consistent with the way we lived , which respects our personal values , spiritual beliefs , cultural background and preserves our dignity ?"
No," a rural setting and we go down to villages . You know - and there is a misconception that in villages you have joined society , joint families and so many people to look after you"
No," , that was perhaps true , 25 to 30 till 25 to 30 years back things are changing very rapidly now and this elderly couple . You see this is the husband . This is the wife , the rest of the people . They are all neighbors when our team came , they all came"
No," , otherwise . Nobody is going to come now the husband earlier his this is a wife wife had severe arthritis . She could n't move , she ca n't get down without support , so the husband used to take the wife hold the wife and take her to the"
No," washroom washroom means there was an open shed somewhere . She used to relieve herself , but since the last three months the husband gradually became totally blind and now the day we went to"
No," visit them , the husband was already totally blind . He could n't see at all , and there was nobody now to take the wife to the washroom and what she used to do was she used to sit in this chair by she used to just lift her sari and she"
No," used to relieve herself so the holes in The chat bye , so it 's it 's not that the family system , the joint family system , definitely it had its own benefits , but then , sadly , so even in rural settings . Nowadays"
No," these are issues which are very prevalent and these issues erode the quality of life Now , what are the principles of spiritual care ? Spirituality is an essential component of each person . As i said , this is"
No," something built in this is not manmade . Religion is manmade , spirituality is always built in spirituality . Is an ongoing issue readdress it over time ? All of us have spiritual issues before you know"
No," , sir sorry now is it okay ? Yes , sir . Please go on so what we need to do is to demonstrate respect for the patient 's values"
No," , autonomy and vulnerability . Do not impose do not impose your own ideas , especially about religion , to a person who is vulnerable . When does a person become vulnerable when they are approaching death when"
No," first with understanding and about 15 years back . Even i i was an atheist , very strong artist and i did n't know anything about religion and people when my patients , when they"
Environment," keep used to ask me religious questions regarding death and dying , i used to be stumped . So then i undertook , you know , classes . I undertook certificate courses , special training in religion . I learned religion"
No," and only when i could learn religion , then i started understanding myself and once you understand yourself , that means you are filling up your own glass and only then you can pour out for others . So physician heal thy self , you need to"
No," heal yourself . I took my own spiritual journeys , my own religious journeys way up in the himalayas . You know exploring various religions . We all have inherent spiritual resources . If you say that no , i i"
No," because she had nobody to talk to . So it was not about treatment out here . It was all about healing . It was healing and , as i said healing is imagine - imagination die right . That is the imitation of god ."
No," , but you see see in the background again religion somewhere or the other . You will always find god hidden . So we always whenever we are in distress"
No," whenever we are in suffering , we either take recourse to religion , or we take reports to spirituality here again this photograph again , this was a muslim gentleman who had lung cancer and just focus on the background"
No," you see . The calendar is written in urdu work here , but then , once i , if you take a closeup view again here , some books on hinduism as well , so religion"
No," loses its sharp edges . As politicians or the society has made religion very sharp . The ages have become so sharp that we keep on hitting and damaging each other , but for a dying person . Religion is something which brings about a sense of meaning or"
No," purpose in life , so it could be any religion , it could be any religion or a mixture of different religions . So as long as it restores a sense of meaning and purpose to one 's life , that is the goal now . I will just briefly talk about each"
No," religion , and this is adi guru , shankaracharya in hinduism and in hinduism . It is believed that we have repeated births from lower forms to higher forms , and"
No," Do not waste the human birth and in hinduism , if you see the bhagavad , gita and all their various verses and all given . I wo n't go into the details of this . I 'M just trying to give you a glimpse of various religions , and if you see that most of these"
No," religions , they speak about the same thing in islam , perspectives also in illness , seeks allah 's help with patience and prayer increase . Remembrance of allah to obtain peace ."
No," of god can help here again that you , you need the power of god right now . There are downsides of religion as well"
No," right . There was a study which showed that high religious coping receiving more aggressive end of life care , so often it 's so . This was one study which actually showed that here is another example . This was again"
No, and once the music began playing this lady opened up her eyes and then she started smiling and then actually she started singing along so because music was very important to her . That was her spirituality
No," , because music gave her a sense of meaning and purpose to her suffering . It helped her transcend her suffering , so it could be anything spirituality does n't have to be same as religion . Always it could be anything"
No, from my own side so that the suffering of that patient or of that family can be reduced ? That is compassion . Your presence is awareness and kindness shift from doing to simply being
No, right . Most important is authenticity if you just sit there but you 're thinking of something else and you 're . Just looking at the watch . Oh five minutes over now i have to go back home or this and then the patient
No," is very clever . The patient keeps looking at you your face with searching glances right . If the patient is not convinced , if the family is not convinced that you have come there with a good intention , because all of us , you know give out vibrations"
No," , modern medicine treats the body . We treat the body . We are not treating the person within the body ; the trick lies in treating the person within the body . Okay , here you can see the fear"
No," fear in her eyes , associated with the process of death and dying . I wo n't go into the details because i do a lot of work on dying dreams , end of life , dreams and visions , and actually i 've done my phd on that uh"
No," as well - and this is this - is the fear of death and dying , and there are facts uh . It 'S a very interesting area and i do work on afterlife also what happens after death and how and provided you believe it and now science is also believing"
No," and religion spirituality . They play a very important role in transcending this period of suffering , to make it more easy to make the paths smoother . This is one of my papers , which was"
No," published way back in 2016 and again i 'll , give you another example of spirituality . This was a little boy who , since his early childhood , used to frequent cancer hospitals , he had lymphoma"
No," spend all his time in a hospital , but he used to watch his other little children go to school , so he always wanted to go to school . So he expressed this wish for us that i want to go to school . So we talked to a local"
No," him . Because in that one week he could live his whole life , because that was his spirituality . He wanted that school . He wanted to go to the school because he did n't want to"
No," consider himself inferior in any way to other children . This was one of the crayon paintings which he had made , which we still have it and as dean sicily , saunders had said that when you consider total pain , the"
No," spiritual aspect is also very important . Each part , the physical part of pain , constitutes only 25 percent . Don'T forget that when you 're treating pain physically with medications and all you 're just treating 25 of the pain"
No," , the rest 75 percent is made of social pain , psychological pain and spiritual pain , which we sort of tend to ignore . These are very important focus on the 75 forget about the 25"
No," percent . Leave it to the doctors . 25 . You all can manage these 75 of the pain . Can'T you , you ca n't do it it does . It does n't require you to be a"
No," doctor . It requires you to have a compassionate heart , that 's all it requires , and there is something called religious pain which is feeling guilty over the violation of moral codes and values"
No," of his or her religious tradition like if you say that , oh i 'm going to have religion like That gentleman , i gave you the example that his son fought with him and went away . So he was thinking that if my son does n't come and"
No," light my funeral by her , then i will go to hell . So that was his religious pain , because that that is what was sanctioned in his religion , whereas spiritual pain is those who have concluded through their own"
No," selfjudgment that there is something wrong with them at their core . If you think right from within that , no no ! No ! I am basically a very bad person , so that is why i am suffering so much so that is your spiritual pain ."
No," So this here was one more example , this elderly lady , who had this huge tumors and she had severe physical pain , which we treated , but even after treatment of her physical pain . She used to have a lot of depression"
No," , and then we finally found out that she had made a kitchen garden . She was always in a state of depression , you see , so this is the kitchen garden which she had planted"
No," because for her , this little kitchen garden gave her a sense of meaning and purpose to her life . This kitchen garden was very important to her . That was her spirituality"
No," , so here garden , that little garden , that vegetable garden was a spirituality , and then we asked a daughterinlaw to come and promise this lady that , okay , even after you die , do n't worry , i will"
No," drive the monkeys away and then finally , she could die in Peace , so this is another example of spiritual pain and then finally , there is hope , which is positive expectation for meaning"
No," attached to life events right . So as long as there is meaning there is hope . So we need to sustain hope , i 'll end , my talk here and if there are any questions , i 'll be happy to"
No," Nobody asking . Can i ask a question , sir . Please see regarding that locus of control , spirituality and uh how how healthcare look at locals"
No," of control . You are speaking about external locus of control and spirituality is external , like no spirituality is very internal . Is it yes , spirituality , which is inbuilt ? Okay , then religiosity"
No," , because religion is manmade . Okay , okay , which which we have created yeah yeah vegan , is something which is created by a group of likeminded individuals . That is , whereas spirituality is something which all of us have within us . It can be expressed in various ways ."
No," Looking at my little child gives me a sense of pleasure , so that is my spirituality . Whichever way doctor , please doctor , please admit yourself and talk . Dr noble"
No," , corporate village , ngos , all various kind of experiences . I want to ask that there is such a huge deficit in spirituality in our field . How do we start addressing that ? Because it 's so"
No," difficult when you 're the uh , you know you 're the only one out there understanding all these things and around you . You see such things happening and you 're not able to express it , and it kind of leads to a kind of spiritual depression that nobody can understand"
No," like we see our colleagues also suffering spiritually . So how do we ? How , when we go to our patients , we see that conflict happening . So then , how do we it 's like ? It 'S kind of crazy . You know like . I hope you understand what i 'm saying"
No," , nice in learning to love your own self and because only if you can fill up your own class with love . Can you transmit that love to others , so that is where the whole"
No, game begins ? You know learning to love your own self and then transmitting that love to others . So burnout is definitely something which i believe that you are going through and it is perfectly normal when
No," multicultural , culturalism and secularism in medical practice , and you are this thing . You know spirituality and how we combine all these things , how you practice it like secular way of practicing"
No," spirituality medicine and then healthcare like that see uh . What we need to , because uh , when we talk of spirituality spirituality , is so very secular , because it 's got nothing to do with religion and when you 're addressing religion"
No," , when you are addressing religion . Being secular means that you are respecting every religion . You are respecting the beliefs of every person , that 's fine , but then it is very difficult to be purely socalled secular . Why ? Because you"
No," need to understand religion , because the patient will keep on asking certain questions to you , which only that religious thing can answer their own religious beliefs can answer . So i am basically a hindu . So i had to go back and read up the"
No," So similarly , those who are in the christian faith need to do that yeah . It should be a part of the medical curriculum , yeah learning , spirituality . It is important because our patients demand that you see yeah here . You are"
No," not doing it with the political motive . You will not be seeing . You will not be seeing uh hindu question alone . You will be seeing so many other places , so when you when so , if you are seeing a muslim patient , you can address their spiritual issues and for the religious issues you"
No," can take the help of a muslim cleric . You have to take their help , yeah yeah right . So here you see again it is not limited to a doctor . It is a teamwork . Yeah really , so you have to the volunteers play an important role in"
No," this whole process . As you were telling you you try to learn religion once you wanted to practice like that , every doctor ever helped personally should learn other religions other than that they belong to that and they lean to"
No," respect other religions , absolutely that otherwise , you know we will not be In tune with their feelings and emotions and their spirituality like uh , and we can not force our own way of thinking our spirituality to other persons , so we have to be ethically"
No," neutral . Also , absolutely hundred percent agree with you , sir . We have two questions in the chat box . What is the spirituality of the person can not be met due to physical health"
No," issues , professors , nikhil , gush . Sorry , could you repeat the question ? What is the spirituality of the person can not be met due to physical health issues , physical health issues like even if you"
No," do n't have a physical health issue , you could be catastrophizing about death . You could be thinking that , will i be dying alone or you could be thinking that what will happen to my family after i die or you would you would be thinking about what will happen after i"
No," die . Will i go to heaven or hell , so there could be so many different types of questions which are not physical , which are not limited to your physical body but which are related to your social body or your psychological body ."
No," So these are so many issues which have nothing to do with your physical presence , and but all these issues will affect your physical body . Also , all these issues can increase your pain . All these issues can increase your sense of"
No," anorexia . All these issues can increase your vomiting right . So all these issues , although they are not physical , but they can have a bearing on your physical health also , so everything is interrelated . After all"
No," That way , sir . Another question from arthur : we are talking religion and spirituality as two different entities , but how about this then ? My religion helps me in my spirituality or experience deeper spirituality"
No," will not necessarily be religious . You might not believe in god you might be an atheist . You might not believe in religion , but that does n't mean that you are not spiritual , even a person who does n't believe in god or any other religious process . He is"
No, feedback and uh . I i thank dr bridget dam for this very interactive and very thoughtful presentation on spirituality . It 'S really giving a insight to . I think that he is giving a good insight to all of us in our practice of daytoday practice .
No," just about kept it together until i got home , then i broke down crying in front of my mum . She listened for a bit and then she told me that , just like physical health , we all have mental health . It 'S our feelings , our thinking , our"
No," What 'S happening around us , these are everyday feelings . Good mental health means experiencing negative emotions . It 'S not always about being happy . Mum can relate to the feelings of stress , so when mom suggested , i take a break from"
No," mom should take her own advice . Most of us only ever share the good things we do n't like to share how we really feel every morning when i wake up negative thoughts stream through my head , getting out of bed and pretending i 'm okay takes"
No," all the energy i have , as the day goes on , The negative thoughts turn from a stream into a river , the water rushes through my head . So loudly it 's hard to concentrate in lessons and some days it 's so bad . It feels like"
No," a waterfall . That 'S trying to pull me over the edge everything is so overwhelming . I did n't think my friends would understand if i told them how down i was feeling , but when sasha opened up to me about how"
No," she told me some things that had helped her , so i tried them too , but it did n't make much of a difference . Even when i tried to be around my friends , i felt alone the things i used to enjoy were n't fun anymore ."
No," unwell , we let people know we ask for help . It should be no different with mental health . Sometimes our overwhelming feelings are brought on because of things in our life . Sometimes they happen for no reason at all ."
Environment," After hearing this , i felt much less alone , and it felt good to talk . Scientists have found exercise can help when you 're feeling low so ahead of year . Encouraged me to sign up to the school football club which sasha was already in . I still have days when the river is"
No," there , but now i 'm beginning to understand my mental health . I 'M learning how to cope our head of year reminded me that my friends , family teachers and lots of others at school are there to help just as much as he is . I had no idea the"
No," people around me could be so understanding and while it 's not always easy to talk about my mental health , the person i 'm talking to might be able to help . If you do n't feel like talking , that 's fine , you could try . Writing sports"

Environment," humans want to continue to live on the planet . It 'S linkage to environmental science is really important , but by and large environmental science is the protection of the environment from one of its deadliest enemies and that 's people ."

No," Brainy Dose Presents: 12 Ways to Naturally Boost Dopamine, The Happy Hormone Do you ever feel like you just don’t have the energy to make it through the day? Is it hard for you to complete things? Are you easily distracted or find it hard to concentrate? If you answered yes to these questions, there’s a good chance that you need to increase your dopamine levels."
No," Often termed the feel good chemical, dopamine is a neurotransmitter that affects mood, focus, energy, and behavior. However, if your dopamine levels are low, this can cause an imbalance in your life. Reduced dopamine production is also linked to depression, attention deficit disorder, obesity, and other medical conditions. Fortunately, there are plenty of natural ways to boost dopamine levels so you can stay motivated, productive, and happy."
No," And if you have a poor diet high in processed foods, you’re likely to be deficient. Start by eating more magnesiumrich foods like spinach, pumpkin seeds, almonds, avocado, and dark chocolate. Taking supplements and soaking in Epsom salt baths can also increase your body's magnesium levels. Number 2 Cut Down on Processed Sugars You're surely familiar with that rush you get after consuming a high amount of sugar."
No," This is often referred to as a sugar high. It's usually temporary and is followed by a crash that leaves you feeling like crap. Similar to alcohol and recreational drugs, processed sugars briefly boost dopamine while affecting the pace at which your body normally produces it. The good news is that eliminating sugar from your diet for a week or two allows your dopamine production to return to normal. And, you won't be craving sugar as intensely."
Environment," In turn, this will help your body produce dopamine responses that aren't tied to sugar. Number 3 Move Your Body We all know that exercise improves overall health and wellness. It particularly boosts dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin; a blend of neurotransmitters that will instantly make you feel better. The best part? It doesn't have to be a strenuous workout."
No," acid Ltyrosine can be particularly beneficial. It can help ensure that you acquire the basic building blocks needed for dopamine synthesis. And while it's important to have a wellbalanced diet, one that includes meals from all food groups, consuming more Ltyrosine (commonly found in proteinrich foods) can help boost dopamine production. Have some more avocados, bananas, almonds, beans, eggs, chicken and fish. Number 5 Take Probiotics"
No," levels. So it's important to take good care of it! Number 6 Listen to Music Listening to music you enjoy releases dopamine in the brain and transmits pleasure signals to the rest of your body. And the more pleasing the music is to the ear, the more pleasurable the experience is for the body."
No," Make a playlist of some of your favorite tracks and listen to it whenever you are feeling low, unmotivated, or experiencing other symptoms that signal low dopamine levels. Number 7 Enjoy Some Physical Touch Studies show that interpersonal touch can boost dopamine levels whether it's someone caressing your back or just snuggling up with your pet. Massage therapy, in particular, has been found to increase dopamine levels by 31%. It also has other benefits, including lowering cortisol, increasing oxytocin, and stimulating"
No," the vagus nerve. Number 8 Take A Cold Shower Believe it or not, showering with water that's 14 degrees Celsius or 57 degrees Fahrenheit raises dopamine levels by 250%! You don't have to go to such lengths, though. You can start by finishing your next shower with a minute of cold water. See how it feels, then gradually increase the amount of time."
No," These chemicals not only increase your enjoyment while you are doing the activity, but they also give you continued motivation.

If you want to be more productive and boost dopamine naturally, try to regularly take some time for meditation or silent reflection. Number 11 Make A List of Tasks and Then Complete Them Whenever you achieve a goal, regardless of how big or small, your brain releases dopamine. An easy way to boost this neurotransmitter is to jot down all the tasks you need to finish before the end of the day."
No," Then, as you tick them off, you'll trigger a release of dopamine in your brain. If you're working on a bigger project, just break it down into several microgoals. Each task you complete will help your brain recognize a microreward and, as a result, will trigger a future dopamine response. This can help you get through those seemingly endless projects by providing your brain a boost to propel you from one microgoal to the next! Number 12 Get More Sleep"
No," Dopamine levels and sleep are closely tied together. You probably already know that a lack of sleep has a negative effect on your mood and productivity. After a night of tossing and turning, you feel cranky and not very motivated. A good night's sleep, on the other hand, will increase your dopamine production and give you the drive to tackle the tasks in the day ahead. So, it's imperative to practice good sleep hygiene. This includes keeping your room dark and quiet, putting away any electronic devices, and aiming"
No," for at least seven hours of sleep each night. There you have it. If you just can't find the motivation to enjoy life to the fullest, know that you can train your dopamine response to help you out.

I'm going to share a story directly from The Worry Solution right. Let me invite you to do a simple experiment to see how your imagination can influence the way you feel. Make sure you're in a safe, comfortable place where you can close your eyes for a few minutes. Focus on your body as if your attention were a radar or sonar beam slowly scanning up and down. Notice if you feel any stress, tension, or discomfort anywhere in your body. Now let's rate it on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no tension and"
No," 10 is all the tension you could stand. Where would you rate the tension level in your body right now? Now, imagine that you are camping in the woods in the middle of the night you need to go to the bathroom, so you throw some clothes on and you shuffle off so that you won't disturb anyone else. It's completely dark with no moon and it takes you a while to find a level place, but you're finally able to do what you need to do. The need attended to, you notice how really dark it is and you start to carefully pick your way back to camp reaching out with your arms so that you don't bump into anything. You trip over tree roots and rocks, you pick up a few scratches from unseen branches."
Environment," After a while, you feel that you've been walking too long and you should have found your campsite already. It's cold and it's dark and you're kind of uncomfortable. You start walking in another direction and then after a while, another, then you realize that you are lost. You quietly call out several times, but nobody answers. Finally you yell loudly, but you still get no response. The night is even darker and colder and you feel very alone. As you wonder what to do next, the background noises of the forest suddenly go strangely quiet, you hear something moving in the brush nearby, it sounds like something big and it's headed toward you. Now stop"
No," for a minute and rescan your body. Where would you rank your tension level now on that 0 to 10 scale? Now, imagine that from the direction of the breaking twigs you hear your good friend call out your name. It's not a bear, you are safe. Notice if your tension goes away immediately or if there's some after effect that lingers for a little while. The author says ""I apologize for scaring you, but the point is, that if you did get tense or scared it's because you have a good imagination and you can see how intimately it is connected to your body."" When we believe we are in danger, but are actually safe, our body and our"
No," mind create the same physical anxiety reaction as if we were in physical danger, our brain signals to our body to pump out adrenaline and trigger that fightflightfreeze response. We do it so much we don't even notice that we're doing it. Okay, take five minutes right now, pull out a piece of paper, and answer this question. Are you 100% safe right now? Go ahead and set a five minute timer. When I was asked this in a workshop, initially I was like 'yeah I'm safe', but then as I took the time, I thought 'well, any of these people could attack me, there could be an earthquake, a fire, heck, I might have cancer or a parasite that could kill me shortly',"
No," you know, pretty soon my mind was creating all of these ways that I could be in danger. The other people in the workshop came up with similar responses, the answer was no, I'm not safe, there are so many things that could kill us at any moment. The presenter simply asked us afterwards did I ask you if you were safe in the future or safe in the now? All of those dangers that I thought of were not happening right now, my sense of fear created them in my mind, these were not actual threats, they were perceived threats, dangers that our minds can imagine, but which our bodies cannot escape. We can't fight them off physically because they're not real."
No," They're imagined danger right? This creates a stuck feeling of anxiety. Anxiety disorders and ptsd are essentially when our minds convince our bodies that we're in danger when we're actually safe. We see danger in our jobs and our commutes and when we read the news. Unlike animals, our powerful brains can see danger in the future which our body reacts to in the present moment. This makes us rush about our days flustered and stressed thinking that it's normal to be constantly anxious. We may notice the stress, but be unaware of the cause. Even sedentary jobs leave us exhausted because our bodies are running a stress marathon during"
No," the day, which includes an elevated heart rate, fast breathing, and high blood pressure. When we're chronically stressed, it actually does not help us stay safe, it decreases productivity. Chronic stress makes us sick, it inhibits thinking, and it distorts our perceptions of the world. Even in a fight, if you're super freaked out and super stressed out, you're probably not going to be as effective at this fight as if you were calm and composed. Calm action, intentional action, is more likely to keep us safe and healthy. So do you do this? Do you bring to mind scary things that could happen or might happen, but there's no action you can take? Sometimes I do,"
Environment," but after this workshop, I was able to give this a name. This is called perceived danger. So how has your stress response, which is supposed to help you perform, gotten in the way of you being productive? You can write this in the workbook or if you're on YouTube, write this in the comments section. We can heal from anxiety and fear when we create perceived safety, noticing that we are actually safe in the here and now. Remember our nervous system has two states the sympathetic response, the fightflight freeze response, and the parasympathetic response, the rest and digest response. We strengthen the part that we use the most."
Environment," So to create safety and calm, we need to foster a parasympathetically dominant nervous system, a calm nervous system, and we do this on a physical level in two ways Number one is creating safety in our mind, changing how we perceive situations, and number two is creating safety in our body, changing our body's physical response to situations through a body up approach. Now we've already talked about creating safety in the body through selfregulation, in this video you're learning how to change how you think about situations when you change the way you think, you change your body's reaction. So the first thing that you've learned is to notice when you think you're in danger, but"
Environment," you're actually safe. Now, let's move on to the next exercise. Take three minutes and write down the things that cause you stress. Go ahead set a threeminute timer, make sure and do this exercise. Now, look at those items again, we generally don't realize it, but the reason that outside circumstances are linked with the stress response is because of our interpretation that they're a threat to our physical safety. So how are you seeing the things on your list as a threat? We got the situation and the response and insert in the middle your interpretation. So the situation might be something like your boss gives you feedback, and the response is feeling a pit in your stomach,"
No," anger, or on the verge of tears. So for example when you have a job evaluation, what is the interpretation in the middle that makes my brain set off that fightflightfreeze response right, that stress or anger response, or that pit in your stomach right? It could be the perceived threat, the fear that I could lose my job, then I'd run out of money and starve to death. This is an example of thinking, even subconscious thinking, that we're in danger when in reality we're quite safe. We often usually don't notice that we're thinking this way, but if we want to regulate our emotions, we need to go back to the steps of emotion processing right, so we notice this is a danger response, then"
Environment," we explore what am I seeing as dangerous?, then we choose to act one or more of the following right, we change our perception or we change our bodily reaction or we take action. So if we change the perception, we think well my boss isn't going to fire me, I'm overreacting, I'm safe I'm okay, or we change our bodily reaction right, we practice calming down the nervous system or we take action to solve the problem like 'oh maybe I wasn't turning in reports on time, so now I'll make sure to do that.' Let me give you another example right, something that causes my husband a lot of stress is when my children make a lot of noise. We're all working from home during"
No," this crazy pandemic right, and every time the kids scream, whether they're happy or mad, it triggers that stress response in him. Sometimes it feels like anger, sometimes it feels like anger. So what's the interpretation in the middle of that? What's the interpretation in the middle of that that contributes to that stress response? Well, if you hear your kids screaming, you might be afraid that they're getting hurt or you might be afraid that they're hurting someone else or you might be afraid that they're interfering your ability to work and if they're interfering your ability to work, then you're not gonna be able to make money, then you're not gonna have"
No," food, then you're gonna starve to death right? See how all of these are danger responses? Same thing goes with like something as simple as rejection from a group right? Like if you get really emotional and upset like if you're in a friend group and they leave you out, I see this all the time with teenage girls right, they're really upset because their friends aren't including them. Why is this triggering such a strong emotional reaction? Situation is being rejected, the emotional reaction is like oh my gosh sadness, fear, anxiety, jealousy right? What's the interpretation in the middle? Well our brain interprets social rejection as being a threat to our life because our ancient"
Environment," brain knows that we needed our village to survive. We needed our village and our people so that we didn't get kicked out, rejected from our village, and left alone in the woods to starve to death. Our deep brain sees danger all the time even when we're actually safe. Now remember name it to tame it? When we don't acknowledge that we're having a ""danger"" response, we feel like it's out of our control, when we name it we can do something about it. So saying the words like ""danger"" and ""safe"", give us the power to clarify the situation and our responses. We can create perceived safety to pair with actual safety by actively exercising our mind to challenge these interpretations."
No," So saying things like 'I am okay, I am safe, or he's just asking me to make a small change or even if he does fire me, which is not likely, I will not starve to death, I'll just find another job, I'm safe.' Saying things like this can be helpful in challenging those thoughts. So here's another way to think about our anxiety response that can help you soothe fear and anxiety. Why do you think our survival instincts are triggered by things like peer rejection or our jobs? Because ancient people would have starved to death if something went wrong with their job or if they were kicked out of the tribe. One of the things we can do when we're"
Environment," feeling freaked out is to ask ourselves 'Does this situation really present a threat to my survival?, If I don't get this report in, am I actually going to die of starvation?, If I get turned down by my crush, will I be kicked out of the tribe and have to wander the wilderness alone?' Reminding our minds and bodies that we are safe will help us calm down, and most likely this is going to help us do a better job on the report or keep our voice steady when we ask that guy out. So take a minute to identify one stressor and ask the question Where is the survival fear here? Is this a valid fear? We're not dependent on our circumstance to feel safe. We create emotional safety within ourselves"
Environment," through integrity. We create emotional safety in our relationships through consistency and compassion. We create physical safety through our perception and our actions as needed. Now let's just do a quick side note on actual danger. If you are in a situation of actual danger, like for example if you're in an abusive relationship or if you are on the verge of starving to death or if you have someone threatening your life, then it's not going to be that helpful to try and you know, change your perception or to decrease your anxiety with these skills. It's not safe, the situation you're in, and it won't work because it's not truthful to"
Environment," say 'I am safe', when you're not safe. So instead, focus on creating safety through action like getting yourself out of that situation. In actual danger it can also be beneficial to practice calming your body to help you make better choices and take action. So by planting, watering, and fostering these seeds of safe thoughts and sensations and activities and by focusing on the present moment, we actually exercise our parasympathetic nervous system and develop selfregulatory neural pathways in the same way that an athlete would develop muscles. So in summary, chronic stress and even getting momentarily flustered, overwhelmed, or anxious, are about perceived threats."
Environment," If you get really uptight in meetings at work or you bristle when you're receiving feedback or if you experience ptsd symptoms or if you just get flustered while making dinner for guests, then you can benefit from understanding the difference between perceived danger and actual safety. When we believe that we're in danger our body and mind create the same physical anxiety reaction as if we were in actual physical danger. This keeps us stuck in the fight flight freeze response. How we think about things, how we interpret our situation, this creates a sense of calm or of stress depending on how we think. So you can foster a calm mind and a nervous system by"
Environment," noticing that you feel in danger when you're actually safe, questioning your interpretation of events, asking 'Am I actually in physical danger right now?', if the answer is no, then it's best to regulate your nervous system by bringing to mind the perception of safety, creating that felt sense of safety, so you say 'This feels dangerous, but I'm actually safe', then you soothe your body, you do some deep breathing or some stretching or whatever it is that calms you down. Now I really encourage you to do the next two activities because when you do them, you're gonna feel a shift in your body, a shift to calm when you do it. These two activities are drawing safety and creating lists of safe"
Environment," things. Now, just like I showed you in the beginning of this section how when we imagine ourselves as being in danger, like in that camping story, we create that danger response in our bodies, when we do these activities that are linked right here, we can actively counteract the negative effects of anxiety by bringing to mind the feeling and the thoughts of safety by imagining ourselves as being safe when we're actually safe. We reaffirm that right here in the present moment we're okay. We can actively counteract the negative effects of anxiety by reaffirming that we are actually safe right here in the present moment.

No," How long have you been having them? For about a week now. They aren’t constant—they come and go, but they’re really painful. Do you have a fever? No, I don’t think so. Any respiratory symptoms? How do you mean?"
No," For example, do you have a blocked nose, a sore throat, a cough, or anything like that? No, nothing like that. Is this the first time you’ve had a problem like this? As far as I can remember, yeah. OK, please sit on the bed over here. I need to check your pulse and blood pressure. I’ll also need to check your lymph nodes to see if they’re swollen."
No," In the dialogue, the doctor asked many questions. Can you remember any? Typically, the doctor will ask about your symptoms, your medical history, and about medication which you’re taking. To ask about your symptoms, the doctor might ask ‘Do you have a fever?’ ‘Do you have a cough?’ ‘Do you have a sore throat?’"
No," The doctor might ask more questions about a specific symptom. For example: ‘How long have you been feeling like this?’ ‘Is this the first time you’ve had a problem like this?’ ‘How severe is the pain?’ If you’re describing your symptoms, it’s common to use the present perfect tense, especially for a problem that appears repeatedly. For example: ‘I’ve been having really bad headaches.’"
No," ‘I’ve been having some stomach problems.’ ‘I’ve been having a lot of problems getting to sleep.’ You could also add a time period, as in: ‘I’ve had this cough for a week now.’ To describe more stable symptoms, use the present simple tense. For example: ‘I have a swelling in my right knee.’ ‘I have this rash on my arm.’ After you describe your symptoms, the doctor might do some basic checks on you."
No," For example, he or she might want to take your pulse check your blood pressure or listen to your heartbeat or breathing using a stethoscope. Next, the doctor will suggest further treatment, and possibly prescribe medicine for you to take. Are you taking any medication currently? No, nothing. Any allergies?"
No," No. I’m going to prescribe you some painkillers. Take one as soon as you feel your headaches starting. If you’re still in pain after an hour, take a second one. Don’t take more than two pills in four hours, or more than six pills in a 24hour period. OK… Also, don’t drink alcohol or take any other antiinflammatories while you’re taking"
No," these. Can’t you do some more tests? What if it’s something more serious? If you’re still having the same problem in two weeks, then we’ll need to investigate further. These things often clear up by themselves. You should also make sure you get enough sleep, stay hydrated, and avoid stress if possible."
No," OK, I’ll do that. Thank you. Doctors can prescribe you medicine or other treatments. They do this by writing what you need on a piece of paper—a prescription. ‘Prescribe’ is the verb, and ‘prescription’ is the noun. You can also use the noun ‘prescription’ to refer to the medicine which a doctor prescribes for you."
No," Common painkillers are paracetamol and ibuprofen. Painkillers may also be antiinflammatories—they reduce fever and swelling. After you have your prescription, you can collect your medicine from a pharmacy—also called a chemist’s in UK English, although both words are used. The doctor or pharmacist might also give you advice on how to take your medicine. For example: ‘Take one pill every twelve hours.’ ‘Make sure you take the pills with food.’"
No," ‘Avoid alcohol while you’re taking these, or they might not be as effective.’ Finally, the doctor might also give you some more general advice. In the dialogue, the doctor mentioned three things. Do you remember them? I said ‘You should also make sure you get enough sleep, stay hydrated, and avoid stress if possible.’ Last question for this section: what happens if you don’t stay hydrated?"
No," If you don’t stay hydrated by drinking enough fluids, you’ll get dehydrated. Next, let’s look at language to use if you aren’t sure where to go or how to get medical help. So, weird question, but what do I do if I need to see a doctor? I’ve never been to hospital or anything here, and I have no idea how it works. You have insurance? No."
No," to pay, it won’t be much. You might have to wait for a long time, though. You mean, you have to wait to see a doctor? Yes, that too, but I meant that after you see a doctor, it might be a long time before you get any treatment. From what I hear, the public health system is really overstretched at the moment, and people have to wait weeks or months for treatment."
No," So, you have private health insurance? Yeah, most people do. You could also go to a private clinic, or just go to a GP and let him or her refer you to the right specialist if you need further treatment. Would that be very expensive? A GP appointment normally costs about 40 or 50 Euros. For further treatment, it depends what you need, obviously."
No," Some people choose to buy private insurance, which can give you more choice about where and when you get treatment. If you’re using public healthcare, you’ll generally register with a GP. ‘GP’ stands for ‘general practitioner’, meaning a doctor who doesn’t specialise in one area. GPs mostly work in small clinics, not in hospitals. If you have a problem, you’ll go to your GP first."
No," Your GP will then help you to arrange further treatment if you need it. For example, your GP might refer you to a specialist if you need more targeted treatment. In other countries, most people have healthcare insurance. In some places, healthcare can be very expensive if you’re uninsured. What about in your country? Look at three questions: One: do most people use public healthcare, or is it more usual to buy private health"
No," insurance? Two: is public healthcare highquality and reliable? Why or why not? Three: are all residents entitled to free public healthcare, or are there restrictions? Could you answer these questions? Try it! Say an answer out loud, or write it down."
No," From what I heard, they want to monitor him for a few days, and then he can go home. So, when can we go? Do they have set visiting hours? Yeah, it’s in the afternoon some time. I can check on their website. Let me check with his wife, too, because I’m sure she’ll be spending time there, and I think there’s a twovisitor maximum."
No," I hope he’s alright. I’ve never had an operation or had to stay overnight in hospital, but I imagine it’s fairly miserable. Yup, you’re not wrong. Hopefully he’ll be discharged soon. We should take him some fruit or something nice to eat. Can we do that?"
No," ‘They’ here refers to the hospital staff. Hospitals have visiting hours, when you can go and spend time with your friends and relatives who are staying there. Even if you need to go to hospital, you might be an outpatient, meaning that you go to hospital, do what you need, and then go home again. The opposite is ‘inpatient’, meaning that you need to stay overnight. When you’re ready to leave hospital and go home, they discharge you."
No," You had a major operation. How long do they say it’ll take to recover? They don’t give exact answers to things like that. I guess every case is different, but they said I should be back to normal in around three months. Three months?! Obviously I won’t be like this for three months, or at least I hope not."
No," I get tired so easily right now. They told me I should get some strength back in a couple of weeks. Do you have to go back in for any more tests? I have to go tomorrow to get the incision cleaned and dressed. It’s a big wound, so that’ll take a while to heal just by itself. Apart from that, I think I have to go back in a month or so for an ECG. Maybe there’s more, but I’m not focusing on that right now."
No," strength back. You also heard the phrase ‘get back to normal’. For example: ‘It’ll take a few weeks to get back to normal.’ A wound is an opening or a cut in your skin. If you have an operation, the surgeon will need to make an opening in your skin, which needs to heal afterwards. Finally, ‘one day at a time’ is a phrase which means you focus on the present, rather"
No," than thinking about the future. You can use it when you’re dealing with a difficult or complex situation. You can also use the longer phrase ‘take things one day at a time.’ For example: ‘Everything’s so busy right now. I can’t make plans for next year. I’m just taking things one day at a time.’ Of course, we hope you don’t need the language you’ve seen in this lesson."
No," But, we still hope it was useful for you. Thanks for watching! See you next time!"
No," Hello , hello , hello , everybody welcome to the webinar . I'Ve just opened my little chat box , and this is kind of the way we do it in our transformation support community . I can kind of see all of you guys . You talk the way you talk is through the"

No," , maybe tried something or tried a bunch of things to to become more accepting of your body in the past , and it has n't worked that the focusing on your selfesteem can actually be a key factor . That can make body image work work when it has n't"
No," in the past , and then i will let you know about the um , the upcoming selfesteem and body image series that we have in our transformation support community . It 'S a 12week series that we 're doing starting in a couple of weeks , and i 'm i 'm just"
No," super duper excited about this one and periodically guys i will be checking the chat box so feel free to talk to me um . Let 'S start off with body image and a definition of body image , so"
No," thomas cash , who is one of the the world 's authorities in terms of research and and writing on body image , talks about body image . Being like your personal relationship with your body um and like any relationship , it 's complex"
No," , so it includes your thoughts . You know thinking of yourself as looking great today or thinking of yourself as looking disgusting , um you 're feeling . So do i feel uh proud , or do i feel ashamed , or do i feel embarrassed or do i feel kind of neutral"
No," weight loss type things ? So it 's related to our thoughts , our feelings and our actions around our relationship with our body , and it does include , of course , our appearance , including a big part of that for a lot of people that we work with , is"
No," weight and shape , but also your you know . Your physical competence - am i weak , or am i strong and your wellbeing ? Am i um ? Am i healthy or am i unhealthy ? We have one of our transformation support community members um"
No," , who a lot of the members who are in our transformation support community are really keen for the upcoming series and one of them sent me an instagram message and said glenn . You know i feel , like my body . Images is worse when i get sick"
Environment," , so that 's what body image is and here 's where you 're , if you have a pen and a pad or if not , you can just do this exercise in your head . Here 'S kind of what psychologists look for when we often talk about like"
No," positive body image or negative body image . Here 'S you know some of the things that we actually look for . So when it comes to a negative body image , the most obvious thing is we 're looking at is dissatisfaction , so i do n't like"
No," the way that i look , but we also very much look for body image preoccupations and regardless of whether i like the way i look or Not how much time , how much energy , how much real estate in my brain is my body image . Taking up"
No," on the positive body image side , the flip to dissatisfaction of satisfaction . We look for satisfaction in our bodies . We do n't always have to be satisfied with every area of our body in order to have a positive body image . Thank"
No," and sort of make start on that sort of um . I think it 's the xaxis . I ca n't remember from school in uni with dissatisfied and if you 're really dissatisfied , you might be up this end . If you 're really satisfied you might be at"
No," okay on this scale . Whatever words we use , how unhappy or happy or how much time , energy and mental space versus how kind of accepting and okay am . I , with my my looks whether i like them or not so much and and obviously what we 're trying to do in"
No," cultivating a more positive body . Image is just to be moving to the right and to be moving up , and we want to do that in any way . That makes sense and in a practical way , this is not necessarily about you kind of jumping out of bed and"
No," experiences . So obviously , if you 've had any of these adverse life , events like if you were teased like like this child , is being teased in this image . If you were discriminated against in any way like this girl is sort of being , maybe more"
No," going to affect your body image , people living in larger bodies tend to have a a slightly more negative body image , not a hugely more negative body image , but a slightly more negative body image . Um women tend to struggle with body"
No," correlates of of body image , uh selfesteem , and that 's why we 're going to talk about why it 's important for a lot of people to work on selfesteem and body image together"
No," or depression . So your mood affects your body image and perfectionism because of course , if um , you know , society has very perfectionistic ideals on what our bodies should look like"
No," let 's have a little look at some of the the sort of the social and cultural factors that affect our body image because , as i 'm going to sort of talk to you about in a minute , the body image issues are so pervasive and we really do find That"
No," the biggest finger that we can point is culture . We live in a culture that is not very fat friendly . This is an example of a um , an ad by people for the ethical treatment of animals , and it says , save"
No," it 's an extreme example , but i think that we all know that The diet industry sells us unrealistically fast , unrealistically , easy , unrealistically , lifechanging weight losses , and so , unfortunately , when we throw that into the mix"
No," to say , is giving us body image issues . Well , in my book i suggest that we we 're going through a body image epidemic , so you 've obviously heard of the the obesity epidemic and i think if we have an obesity epidemic , we absolutely also have a body image epidemic ."
No," , but what is as much more of a worry is this , these subclinical body , image , concerns or or nonclinical concerns that i call insanity now if we look at um"
No," i 'll start with the adolescence . Actually , you know in adolescence : we see that 75 of high school girls want to be thinner and now that number is , unfortunately , is increasing um . But i 've highlighted the children in red"
No, because only since really kind of the turn of the century have we started to see body image issues in like significant body image issues in primary school children . So we know that the pervasiveness of body image concerns is getting more
No," psychologist , love . You know strange and big words , but a normative discontent with our weight and shape and our body image so which means , if you use you know , if you think about yourself , you ask most of your friends and family . Most of those people are not going to be"
No," satisfied in the way they look , which i think is a real shame because , of course , all of us we exist in the body . Okay , let 's talk a little bit about the effect of body image on mental health . So how does body image"
No," depression and anxiety . We do know that if you um , if you have body image , concerns or negative body image , you 're more likely to experience , depression and low selfesteem , and what we know is that that body image"
No," concerns significantly reduce the quality of everyday life . For this cash and fleming study shows about 20 of women , say every day is significantly negatively affected by my body image um"
No," i may be biased , because i 'm talking with people who have body image concerns all the time . But for me i think that number 's actually a lot higher um . We also find that body image concerns are like they 're , a key feature of eating disorders , including anorexia bulimia and"
No," binge eating disorder . In fact , you you um , you rarely see uh eating disorders without body image concerns so , regardless of any other impact , just the psychological impact alone on your mental wellbeing is absolutely it 's huge ."
No, negative body image is actually a significant barrier to reaching and to maintaining a um a healthy weight . So body image concerns are associated with being a higher body weight which we 've kind of talked about . But they 're also associated with these
No," diet ourselves into weight , loss and regain and do that again over the period of our lives um , so it 's associated with dieting . It 'S also associated with overeating . So when you 're - and you know you might think about yourself when you 've had kind of"
Environment," bad body image days , you 're actually more likely to eat more rather than less and again , i suppose not surprisingly body image concerns are associated with avoiding exercise and , if you 're not comfortable In the skin , you 're in you might be worried about"
Environment," how other people are going to perceive you and you 're less likely to exercise , especially out in public . As a result , if you have body image concerns you tend to , if you do a weight loss program , you lose less weight , you 're . Actually , then more likely to regain it ."
No," If you , you know , get to the end of a weight , loss program and you 're , not happy with your body , you 're , more likely to sort of give up and abandon your efforts and regain weight and people who have body image concerns are more likely to do the yoyoing Over"
No," time , rather than maintain a sort of a a more stable body weight , so so so body image concerns um way , i kind of say it is that they um they cause more problems than they cure or um"
Environment," or it can seem um just unbelievable like i could never do that . But what i 'm going to try and do is through a little exercise , is um put love in a um"
No," , a more practical sense for you . That might be workable and you might even be able to start to work towards loving your body a little bit more in a way . That 'S right for you ! So we 're going to look at this question of what is love ."
No," i was in pain or if i was hungry , so this is an example of what people often find . Is that that if we were to be more loving of our bodies , we would actually care for our bodies more . So if you 're feeling , like body , shame or body hatred , is"
No," you to think about that is um . Is you know ? How could i be more loving , and this is in a very practical , very workable way : it 's not an abstract or an esoteric idea . It 'S like some of those adjectives . How could i apply that way of loving to my body ?"
No," This is a question that a lot of people have it 's like : okay , yeah , but what happens to my weight then i still really want to lose weight . Let me show you a little model that i created that i call the body love model and it kind of helps , tie in body image"
No," for weight concerns because most of my work , i do a lot of work in body image and most of the people . I 'M working with have weight concerns . That 'S the number one concern . So if we think about two different ways of"
No," um or a bit of a a chore that you have to do because you 're you 're not right , you 're , not good enough . You'Re um you 're you 're flawed in some way and you 've got to fix yourself , which does n't tend to be a very motivating way of thinking about your habits , but for a"
No, researcher we covered before that losing weight may help with body image . But it does n't actually necessarily guarantee you 're going to feel happy in your body . So that 's the weight loss model that i think most people just naturally follow
Environment," energy , probably your mood might be a little bit better . When you exercise you get a bit of an endorphin and an adrenaline boost when you care for yourself in other ways , you feel better straight away , so the the feeling better is kind of immediate"
No," just rely on the body 's wisdom over time to come up with what its ideal weight is . So that 's the body love model . This is a question , a lot of people . I think who do body image , work , um kind of have , whether consciously or subconsciously . It 'S like look . Can i"
No," done on australian women who lived in larger bodies , and it showed that cognitive behavioral therapy so therapy we 're focusing on our cognitions our thoughts , our beliefs , our attitudes and our behaviors . So our actions and when we focus on our um our"
No," thoughts and our actions , they then affect how we feel they looked at the the results of doing a cognitive , behavior therapy program for improving body image and what they found was this whole host of really cool Benefits"
No," the appearance , ideals that we get in the media and from society . All of the time - and they just place a bit less importance on on appearance in general , so it absolutely says if you 're kind of wondering can i ever"
No," change the way i feel about this body and change . My relationship with the body that i 'm in the answer is probably yes : okay , let 's switch tracks for a second and let 's move to focusing on selfesteem . So what 's selfesteem um"
No," morris rosenberg , who is the um the the king of selfesteem ? And i had a total fanboy moment where um dr rosenberg uh spoke to me only via email , not by phone um . But i actually use that rosenberg"
No," scale in my online questionnaire and i asked asked him permission to use it and when he emailed me back as a 25 year old uh newgrad psychologist , i was super chuffed he 's like the the michael jordan of selfesteem um"
No," , but yeah . The definition is um is about it 's you , whether you take a positive or negative attitude towards yourself and one 's overall sense of being worthy and valuable as a person . I think , in this context we can think of your body image as your relationship"
Environment, with your body and your selfesteem as your more overall relationship with yourself . So when it comes to we 're going to do a very similar exercise when it comes to selfesteem
No," what are sykes ? Look for when we talk about positive and negative selfesteem , the things that we will watch out for uh when it comes to negative selfesteem . Is you know whether you have an unfavorable attitude towards yourself and what that really means is , you know"
No," , do i think , i 'm a bad or a good person and then also that critical inner voice is my inner voice ? Very judgmental , is it very harsh on me ? Is it very cutting when it comes to positive selfesteem ? We Look at the opposite . Do i have a favorable attitude towards myself ? Do i"
Environment," think , i 'm fairly good as a person and do i have a compassionate inner voice so whether i think i 'm good or i 'm bad ? How gentle on myself am i around my goodness or badness ? So what i 'd like to do now is just do that that same little exercise is just"
No," social media , because social media has a big impact , negative impact on body image , but i think there 's a real upside that we can just kind of chat to each other , which i think is is super duper Cool right , so that 's good ! I 'M glad you had a fangirl moment now . That 'S that 's funny !"
No, but also start your process of your own reflection . So you can start to see where you sit and what you might like to do about it . So why do we work on selfesteem ? If we 're you know
No," , if we 're interested in becoming more accepting of our bodies , the reason is that selfesteem is intimately intertwined with body image . These things are so closely connected . I talked about this in a recent blog , i wrote ."
No," 03 to 04 becomes a sort of a moderate association and anything above four is a strong association . So if we look at the correlation between selfesteem and body image , it 's 063 , so a really really strong"
No," body , image can be explained by your selfesteem and vice versa . So that makes selfesteem a pretty big factor to ignore if we 're looking at becoming more accepting of our bodies and cultivating more positive body image ."
No," Of course , the relationship between selfesteem and body image is complex for some people , their body image concerns greatly affect their selfesteem . So you know for a lot of us"
No," , because society places so much emphasis on looks um . Our body image can get kind of too big for its boots and and start to become the dominant force in shaping our selfesteem for some people . Their body image"
No," concerns actually really a symptom of selfesteem of a low selfesteem , a more general feeling of not okay or or not good enough . That pervades all areas of life and body image is just just kind of one of those areas and for both people . I"
No," little bit . One more layer of complexity is that selfesteem not only affects body image directly , but it affects some other important factors that then affect body image . So , for example , we find that people lower in selfesteem tend to"
No," experience more depression and higher levels of disordered eating , and we know , of course , that depression and disorder of eating then will affect your body image um , so so body image also not only directly sorry , so Selfesteem not only directly"
No," affects body image , but also indirectly affects body image , which is just another reason why it 's important to explore the role that selfesteem might be playing in any body image concerns that you have and look selfesteem is just good to"
Environment," work on . For other reasons , selfesteem is really closely linked with happiness , um and also work performance in a few different ways . Sticking at exercises , so people higher in selfesteem , tend to stick with um"
No," unique individual . Why uh improving your selfesteem may help in your life ? It 'S just for a lot of people . It 'S a it 's ! A good thing to work on anyway , so sort of putting this all together ."
No," A question um you might be asking is like okay . Well , would it be helpful for me to work on my selfesteem or my body image , or do i need to work on both um i 'll , give you the therapy answer . The theory of the answer is just to ask yourself"
No," so often so often the answers are with me and then often in therapy . I always just say to my clients : i 'm like : do you think this is more of like a body image thing like how you feel about your body , or do you think it 's more of a like a selfesteem thing like how do you feel"
No," time , just go to the weight management . Psychology website , click on mindset , quiz , you get a free report and the things to look at for selfesteem . We just measure - you know it 's literally"
No," the title of it is selfesteem rosenberg scale and for body image . Just look at the body image , just look at the body satisfaction scale , and if your your selfesteem rosenberg scale or your body satisfaction scale"
No," are kind of below the norms that would suggest that you could benefit from from working on them . You will find a range of other body image measures in the um in the questionnaire and that 's because body image is something that 's really interesting , like a lot of our people are"
No, interested in it um and it 's a complex thing . So we like to measure in a variety of ways but they 're the ones i would look at if you 're just asking yourself that question would i benefit from working on my selfesteem
No," or body image um and mr nick has um , has put up the the link to That so so , please check that out . It 'S just one tiny ! I just wanted to share with you a nice little body image story to kind of bring this into"
No," think skinnier slash physically perfect people deserve . As i write those words , i realize how ridiculous and irrational that sounds , however , being a person who has always struggled with weight and body image . That is what i believe ."
No," me and i always am a work in progress because we are we 're human . But if we have the right tools , we can pull ourselves up from distorted , irrational thinking patterns more quickly each time and they will wear their ugly head every now and again , but that 's reality ."
No," So let me let you know about the um , the upcoming series that we 're doing in our transformation support community , for if you want to take any steps further , i just want to let you know about this . Super duper cool , uh program that we 've"
No," whole five weeks on selfesteem . So we start off with the selfesteem we 're going to look at your selfesteem story and and how you develop , that critical voice inside and and what that sounds like for you , because awareness is the the first step"
No," , then pretty quick pretty quickly . We start to look at rewriting your selfesteem story um . You know we talked about love before and love being partly about acceptance , and so we 're going to develop a less judgmental"
No," develop an unhealthily inflated selfesteem . We want your selfesteem to be more or less married to reality and look at if there are any areas where you want to improve yourself . How can you think about yourself in new ways with affirmations , and how can you"
No," act yourself into those new ways , so you actually create evidence for your new selfesteem . So this program is not only about thinking differently about yourself , but it is about taking different actions , because that is an important part of it ."
No," some of those Things we could give it a bit of a due date or an expiry date , because maybe we 've given ourselves a hard enough time already and then we 're going to do a special session on on strengths . You know , i think that a lot of us are"
No," not great . At acknowledging that the good things that we do , the great things that we 've achieved so we 're going to look at how we can take that in a little bit more . So that 's the work we 're going to do on um on selfesteem . So you can see it 's very simple and each"
No," all works out . Fine , we kind of create the series that way then we 're going to do five weeks on body image , so the selfesteem work will really prepare you for more successful work on body image ."
No," We'Re going to look at creating a more balanced body image , so one that 's less negative , one , that 's more positive and one that has a bit of a middle ground in there , because , if we 're a bit perfectionistic , it is a bit like . I might have these parts of my body that are"
No, this reality that society has really given us . Our body image concerns we 're becoming more and more critical of our bodies than we 've ever been and the societal norms . What our bodies should look like are getting more and more emphasized and more and more unrealistic .
No," these negative rituals that we do to try and um hide our body image concerns or try and make up for our body concerns , but they actually end up making your body image worse over time . So we 're going to look at reducing the negative rituals and"
No," support community . So let me let you know a little bit about that , so the transformation support community um is a community where we we help . You transform your eating your physical activity , your weight and your body image"
No," is a series of three audio programs and two out of those three contain hypnosis . So that 's a nice passive way to to transform that a lot of our members like we have just a beautiful um facebook community , where the group supports each other . But we"
No," um to do one on physical activity . Again , that 's really important when you 're talking about your selfesteem and body image too , because taking care of yourself is of course an important part of selfesteem and body image ."
No, So let me really really quickly show you around the transformation support community um now guys just checking goodness you ca n't see my password . Can you see i want to see some of your face ?
No," eating and psychological wellbeing . If you click in there , you 'll see all of the webinars . So the next series is the series that we 're going to add to this , the one on selfesteem and body image , but you have access to all of these as a member . So"
No," body image work we 're doing in the upcoming series . Final thing is : if we look at the um complete reprogramming series , this is our audio programs . We'Ve got relaxation and affirmation the walking companion , they 're , the two that"
No," have hypnosis in them and then we 'll be recommending our members do this weight off your mind , audio program , where we 're talking about body image in section one session two is on selfesteem and session three 's on Mental health and happiness"
No," my slides and guys , i 'm conscious of the time i might take you for like another few minutes . Yet , if you , if you can stay with me - and this is this - will give you a great example of what it 's like in the transformation support community , because"
No," you and then you just still remain a member for your the rest of your time that you , until your sort of your payment period , your membership period runs out . So it 's pretty easy , um and then , like i said you know some people wonder how many members there"
Environment," um slides very often it 's more just us talking and typically we 'll have like one little exercise that we do in the session . Most often we do it in the session and the idea of that is that we kind of do it together , whether it 's"
No," any of these questions . Also , someone asked : is this a series i can access without membership to the support community , i 'm at uni at the moment in my final year . So this is the only way you can do . This one is through the the support community"
No," independent learning through because it 's as when you sign up to the membership community , all the webinars are there all the online programs . Are there all of the audio programs ? Are there and we 're there to help support you"
No," uh to to make sense of the program in a way that is , is right for you , one of our key um . Our key values of the tsc is flexibility , so you know some people like the online programs . You know they like lots of structure , lots of detail . They like to go"

No," more , and this is you know , selfesteem and body image , they 're deep , they 're , complex uh . There are , you know they can be a bit challenging , so"
No," Hey well , casters , listen ! It is all too easy to buy into the belief that your body is just not good enough . It 'S too easy to feel inadequate , like you need to constantly change who you are and what you look like just to fit into an ideal of beauty . Stop breathe huh"
No, today on wellcast we 're going to be talking about body image . Sometimes we get so focused on the parts of our bodies that we wish . We could change that . We forget to recognize how amazing we are here . We offer five suggestions to help . You quiet the unhealthy negative
No," thoughts about your shape and size and boost your selfesteem step . 1 , look inward and be your own inspiration . The average American model is 511 and weighs a hundred and seventeen pounds , meaning she 's seven inches taller and weighs 23 pounds less than the average"
No," you an individual strength can be found in differences . What a boring world it would be if we all looked exactly the same aim to be the best you . You can be step 2 . Think about this , you do n't want to sacrifice your future health for your"

Environment," and women around you and your immediate life who managed to balance family career and exercise . Everyone gets a boost from a compliment , so remind these individuals , just how beautiful they are inside and out and that they inspire you hey , you never know who else around you"

No," determine the safest and most effective path for getting the results that you desire , step 5 step away from the mirror and help somebody else assessing your Appearance for hours each day can turn you into a selfobsessed monster instead get out of your head and"
No, go do something for others : get involved in an afterschool tutoring program or gather a group of friends to help out at a local shelter . Volunteering will help you gain experience and it will lift your mood plus you 'll probably make new friends
Environment," professional for health and fitness advice based on your specific situation and , lastly , be active in your community and make sure your eating and exercise habits are smart and safe longterm choices . Well , that 's all for me today ! Well , casters , would you do me a kindness"
Environment," in promoting more of our mental health content. Now, let's continue. We all have different ways of dealing with stressful circumstances. Maybe you like to go to the gym and workout, or maybe you like to turn the music up in your car and sing along to the radio, when you're stressed out."
No," However, in our modern day society, it functions as a selfdefense mechanism, you prepare for the worst just in case. But, this behavior might be causing you more stress than necessary. High levels of stress can lead to severe mental and physical health problems,"
No," like depression and even heart disease. A tool to help overcome this need to catastrophize would be, to allow yourself to think of the five top worst outcomes. And then, ask yourself, how likely they are to actually happen. If you feel like a bad outcome is truly likely, then plan for that one outcome,"
Environment," create a plan that is flexible and doable in case it needs to change. This will give you a better sense of security going forward, and create less stress in your life. Number four, repressing your feelings. Are you you repressing your feelings because you think that no one cares?"
No," can rob you of opportunities that you need to be taking advantage of in your current present. If you find yourself taking frequent trips down memory lane, figure out what specifically appeals to you about those memories, and try to recreate them in the present. The present can sometimes be dim and gray,"
No," Sleep is essential. You can't function or survive without it. While your body is resting, your brain is a flurry of activity. It organizes the day's events and files them into storage so you can easily retrieve them later. It also catches up on housekeeping,"
No," clearing away wastes that build up during the day. The more deeply you sleep, the more effective your brain is at cleaning itself. Adults typically need seven to nine hours of sleep for maximum brain performance, but many of us don't get it. Too little sleep negatively affects your ability"
No," to remember and concentrate. It can also make you moodier and more irritable and increase the risk of anxiety and depression. In addition, going too long without sleep has similar effects to being drunk, impairing judgment and performance, and increasing the risk of accidents and injuries."
No," Over time, a lack of adequate sleep may also increase the risk of dementia. To ensure you're getting enough sleep, practice good sleep hygiene. Put away electronic devices an hour before bedtime and do something relaxing. Go to bed at the same time each night"
Environment," and wake up at the same time each morning. Avoid stimulants like caffeine in the late afternoon or evening and alcohol and heavy meals before bedtime. Keep your bedroom quiet, cool, and dark, and try to get in at least 30 minutes of moderately intense exercise on most days,"
No," which can improve both sleep and your overall health. The better you sleep at night, the better your brain will function and the better you'll feel."
No, My name is Matthew Walker . I am a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California Berkeley and I am the author of the book . Why we sleep . We certainly know that a lack of sleep will actually prevent your brain from being able to initially make new
No," memories . So it 's almost as though without sleep , the memory inbox of the brain shuts down and you ca n't commit new experiences to memory . So those new incoming informational emails are just bounced and you end up feeling as though you 're a music , you ca n't essentially"
No," make and create those new memories . We also know that a lack of sleep will lead to an increased development of a toxic protein in the brain that is called beta , amyloid and that is associated with Alzheimer 's disease , because it is during deep sleep at night when a sewage system"
No," within the brain actually Kicks into high gear - and it starts to wash away this toxic protein beta amyloid . So if you 're not getting enough sleep each and every night , more of that Alzheimer 's related protein will build up the more protein that builds up the greater your"
No," risk of going on to develop dementia in later life . What are the effects of sleep deprivation on the body ? Well , there are many different effects . Firstly , we know that sleep deprivation affects the reproductive system . We know that men who are sleeping just five to six hours a"
No," night have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior . So a lack of sleep will age you by almost a decade . In terms of that aspect of virility and wellness . We also know that a lack of sleep impacts , your immune system . So after just one night of 4 to 5"
No," hours of sleep , there is a 70 % reduction in critical anti cancer . Fighting immune cells called natural killer cells and that 's the reason that we know that short sleep duration predicts your risk for developing numerous forms of cancer , and that list currently includes"
No," cancer of the bowel cancer of the prostate , as well as cancer of the breast . In fact , the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong that recently , the World Health Organization decided to classify any form of nighttime shift work as a probable"
No," carcinogen . So , in other words , jobs that may induce cancer because of a disruption of your sleep wake rhythms . We also know that a lack of sleep impacts , your cardiovascular system , because it is during deep sleep at night that you receive this most wonderful form of"
No," effectively blood pressure . Medication , your heart rate , drops your blood pressure , goes down if you 're not getting sufficient sleep you 're , not getting that reboot of the cardiovascular system . So your blood pressure rises . You have if you 're getting six hours of sleep or"
No," less a 200 % increased risk of having a fatal heart attack or a stroke in your lifetime . There is a global experiment that is performed on 16 billion people twice a year and it 's called daylight savings time , and we know that in the spring , when we lose one hour of sleep , we"
No," see a subsequent 24 % increase in heart attacks the following day . Another question , perhaps , is : what is the recycle rate of a human being ? How long can we actually last without sleep before we start to see declines in your brain function or even impairments within your"
No," hours , your mental capacity is so impaired that you would be as deficient to someone who is legally drunk behind the wheel of a car . So if you were to ask me what is the recycle rate of a human being , it does seem to be about 16 and we need about eight hours of sleep"
No," Smoking causes sickness and disability and it kills . There are more than 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke , sixty of which are known to cause cancer . Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body reduces your health and causes many diseases . Let 'S see how it affects the"
No, smoker . It causes oral and lung cancer and increases the risk of many other cancers . It also causes breathing problems and increases the risk of dangerous infections . Like pneumonia smokers have more of a chance of having a heart
No," attack and are twice as likely to have a stroke . Smoking can even accelerate hair loss in men . Smoking also affects the eyes , and smokers are more likely to develop cataracts as they age , and it raises the risk of developing weakened bones or"
No," only to themselves . Smokers also expose others to tobacco smoke in offices , homes and public places . Those most at risk are their own family and friends . Passive smoking exposes nonsmokers to most of the same toxic gases , chemicals and fine particles that"
No," smokers inhale . Passive exposure causes similar health effects . As for those who smoke , children are particularly susceptible and are more likely to suffer from asthma and serious lung infections . Cigarettes contain nicotine , which is highly addictive . Some research"
No," has suggested that it can be more addictive than heroin . Even if you want to quit , you may find it difficult because you are addicted to its effects . So it 's important never to start smoking as it is difficult to stop later and if you already smoke , stop as soon as"
No," possible , now 's the time to quit smoking and tell others how to do the same life is better without smoke"
No," out . What are the stages that i need to do to actually make a difference ? Okay , so as it says here , it 's like a process for doing health and community work and the presea proceed model really focuses on the community they 're"
No," kind of like they 're key like if we 're trying to make a difference in a community . We actually have to go into that community and understand that community and consult with that community in order to make an intervention , that 's actually"
No," going to serve their needs , not just what we think their needs are . We really need to identify this community and understand it before we can make a difference . Okay , so the precede proceed model . It really"
No, of our community and what the issue is and what are the kind of barriers . And what are the kind of things that are going to help this intervention and we 've made an intervention ? That 'S precede
No," communities and people that we 're trying to target , and that 's really important , especially in this first phase , where we talk with our population and figure out what kind of quality of life"
Environment," issues are they really Facing is it ? Are they facing uh , like educational , low education levels , low income levels , low opportunities for physical activity , low opportunities to practice their cultural practices ?"
No," them being able to , let 's say practice their culture ? Okay , and maybe it is a health concern , maybe because um their community um has a lot of physical inactivity . They ca n't even meet up to to practice the cultural things that"
No," of that community and sometimes , if that 's kind of pieced , together with this third phase , which is kind of the behavioral and lifestyle assessment too okay . So what kind of things for instance , are blocking their ability to be active ?"
No," need to be changed in order , so , for instance , this community is more more more physically active okay . So in the next stage here we look at this is kind of how , i would argue , is one of the bigger stages , because we need to look at the"
No," impacts their ability to be active , or maybe they just do n't have the knowledge or the right attitudes or the right beliefs about physical activity . Okay , so again , this is a predisposing factor because it happens before that behavior even takes place . Okay , and"
No," to do it ? Do they have good attitudes about it and beliefs about it ? An enabling thing would be providing the the banks , okay with physical activity , and enabling factor could be like having good good parks having good um"
Environment," , having cheap access to gyms right these things or making more gyms in a particular area . These things enable people to actually participate in that behavior , okay , to make it possible okay and there 's lots of areas where we"
No," , positive reinforcement or even negative reinforcement - sometimes works too , but , like so the example i have here . A reinforcing factor is like you will be fined if you 're trying to quit smoking ."
No," Something that 's going to like reinforce you not smoking . Is that if you do smoke you 're going to get a fine for smoking , something that reinforces wearing a mask in colombia is , if you do n't wear a mask : you 're negan , fine ."
No," Conversely , it could be like praise like if you do quit smoking . Maybe the people around you they 're going to be like yeah there 's a community excitement about it . A really good example here is"
No," and see : can we hit all three of them in our intervention or and again we 'll work with our community to figure these out ? Like are these areas where what are these areas , and where can we actually make a difference in a way that our"
No," community wants us to make a difference ? Okay , because remember you got to work with your community on this okay , and then phase five is like is what we want to do actually possible . What are the administrative barriers ?"
Environment," What are the political barriers in place right ? So if we 're trying to get clean drinking water to a to a place , is there political capital to do that right if we are trying to build more parks , so people find it easy to exercise ?"
No," okay . So all of that is the precede okay . So before my intervention , let 's talk to my community figure out what their problems are figure out . Why they have those problems figure out how we can ? What are the predisposing"
No," Okay , so that 's precedent so now that we have preceded and we 've thought of an intervention we 've consulted with our community , we kind of have an idea of what we want to do and we 're going to do it this way , because it actually helps this community"
No," intervention that , like help to develop the intervention to be like hey , are we actually doing what we said we were gon na ? Do we said we were going to do x , y and z for this community ? Are we delivering the program the way we said"
Environment," specifically , are we having an impact on behavior lifestyle and environment like we wanted to ? Okay has the environment ? Changed has behavior change and again surveys , uh randomized control tiles ."
No," that actually addresses their needs . Their lifestyles , their limitations , their advantages , it 's just a better way of thinking out an intervention and not just trying to do things willynilly . That 'S the precede proceed"
Environment," How to deal with health anxiety and hypochondria. I'm gonna talk about what it looks like, and what you can do about it. I'm Dr. Tracey Marks, a psychiatrist, and I publish weekly videos on mental health education and selfimprovement. If you don't want to miss a video,"
No," click subscribe and the notification. This topic is based on a viewer question from Littleredridingkyle, and he says, ""You should do a video on hypochondria/health anxiety. ""I'm only 15, and mine is ruining my life. ""I can't sleep, because I'm afraid my heart will stop,"
No," even after you've been told that you don't. You may believe that the doctor missed something. You may even believe the anxiety that you have will turn into something more serious, like dying in your sleep, or having a heart attack. In 2013, the newest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual"
No," that your body starts making up symptoms that match a disease process that you're worried about. For example, if you are worried that you have brain cancer, you can start having balance problems and dizziness, and maybe even headaches. Then, when that wave of anxiety passes, those brain cancer symptoms just disappear, like magic."
No," Until you start having some other body symptom. What's the difference between general anxiety with physical symptoms and hypochondria? Because anxiety can be very physical. For example, let's say you need to give a talk, and you become anxious about it."
No," With general anxiety, the first time you get the lump, you might get scared and wonder if there is seriously something wrong. You go see your doctor, he examines you, and tells you that your throat is fine, and it's probably anxiety. You feel reassured, and the next time it happens,"
No," you remember, oh this is what happens when I get anxious, and then you work on calming down. That's generalized anxiety. In contrast, the person with hypochondria isn't reassured by that doctor's visit. They may think that this is a new symptom that's come up since the last doctor's appointment,"
No," so it must be something else and not anxiety. Or, the doctor missed something, or there's some hidden undiscovered problem that medical science just hasn't been able to detect until your problem advances to the point where you're close to death, and then they'll figure it out."
No," It's a conditioning response. And that's one of the keys to the treatment. So, let me explain. You've probably heard the story of Pavlov's dog. Pavlov was a Russian scientist who studied learning theory and classical conditioning. Pavlov showed that you could trigger"
No," In a similar way with health anxiety, you come to associate the feeling of anxiety with a physical sensation, and you eventually learn to fear the physical symptoms, and see them all as dangerous. Let look a little closer at this. Let's say you have anxiety."
No," It can be free floating anxiety about nothing in particular, or it could be something that's completely unrelated to your body. Maybe you lost your job, or you have a big deadline coming up. Then, in response to the anxiety, you also have a body sensation,"
No," who says that their uncle complained of chest burning just before he went to bed, then he died in his sleep. So what's happening right now? You're gathering more evidence and proof that what you're experiencing really is more than just anxiety."
No," And seeing that post reinforces your concerns about your chest burning, and that they're something legitimate and shouldn't just be blown off as anxiety. Your next response is to test your theory that your heart is on the verge of failing, by paying really close attention"
No," that you read about during your second round of research. It started with chest burning, but now you've got shortness of breath, and you find yourself having a hard time breathing when you're just sitting trying to relax. And this is just more reinforcement for you, that what you really believe is true."
No," And at this point, you may go to back to the doctor who told you 2 months ago that your heart was fine. But this time you have more symptoms than you had before, like the shortness of breath. And so, you even think you might even see a little bit of swelling in your legs. The doctor checks you and says, your heart is fine."
No," She may even tell you, it's probably anxiety. And you might feel a little better, especially because you're at the doctors office and your symptoms kinda go away a little bit. But you're not really satisfied, because the doctor said that there's nothing wrong, but she didn't even do body scan."
No," How can you get help for this? Medication for anxiety can help somewhat by calming the anxiety, but it doesn't really address the thought and behavior cycle. The medications that we would use would be serotoninenhancing antidepressants like Prozac."
No," What tends to be more helpful is cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT. With CBT, you address your distorted, automatic thoughts that you have about your body sensations, because your fears are triggered by body sensations. An example of a distorted thought in hypochondria is that good health means you don't have much"
No," that you don't have a physical illness that needs treatment. Just because you worry about your health doesn't mean that you don't have a real health problem. The issue is, you assume that any health problem that you have is catastrophic or permanent. So get medical clearance,"
No," so that then you can feel free to focus on the problem as an anxiety problem and not as a medical problem. Second, you wanna see a therapist who is trained in, and uses, CBT in their practice. You don't want to sit around talking about your relationship with your mother."
Environment," but many more nonpsychiatrists do CBT. Once you're in the therapy, here are some components of the therapy. One is education on the illness or illnesses that you're concerned about. Now, the facts here will come from your medical doctor, but your therapist can help"
No," is the one who needs to address these questions, not the Internet. Someone in the comments said that she saw multiple doctors, and they ruled out this and ruled that out, but she still had pain. So she asked me in the comments, why was she was still having pain?"
No," Well I can't tell her why she's still having pain. No one on the Internet can tell her with any accuracy, why she's having pain. The person who can tell her that is the person who examined her, ran the tests for her, and that would be the person who would say,"
No," ""You don't have cancer, ""because people with cancer have this, this, and this, ""and you don't have that. ""You don't have a brain tumor ""because people with brain tumors have this, this, and this. ""You don't have that, ""so that is why you don't have a brain tumor."""
Environment," with other possibilities. And this is where you can use the medical information that you wrote down from your doctor. So, lets go back to the concern about dying of a heart attack in your sleep. In general, there's different types of heart disease. This might be something like your doctor might say."
Environment," There are some genetic diseases, thought, that cause accelerated plague formation, but if you had that, there would be other signs and symptoms other than chest burning. And these would be signs that would trigger a doctor to investigate. So this is the kind of education"
No," that you would want to get from your doctor about your situation, to know why what you feel isn't a certain disease. So ask, ""Why don't have I have heart disease? ""Why don't I have a brain tumor?"" And write down those answers"
Environment," It's used for obsessive compulsive disorder to stop the compulsive behavior, but it can also be used with health anxiety. The idea is to use exercises that your therapist gives you to expose yourself to the anxious thoughts, then not allow you to research or check your symptoms. Sometimes your therapist may use relaxation techniques"
No," or other activities, to distract you from engaging in the behaviors. What if you can't afford to see a therapist? Are you just doomed? There are selfhelp books out there on CBT for anxiety and worry. The difference is,"
No," Before you see your doctor, make a list of your conclusions, you draw on your own, about each of your physical symptoms. Take this list to the doctor, and get him or her to explain why your conclusions are incorrect. You have to use some judgment though. If you have a two page list,"
No," Then the next time you have a physical symptom, pull out the card and read it. If you think, yeah but he didn't know at that time that I also have pain in the shoulder, maybe this is something new. Resist the urge to look it up. Use selftalk to change the monologue"
No," in your head about that. Here is an example of a selftalk script. I'll have this in the description, and you can just copy it if it applies to you. I'm gonna say it as if I'm you. So going back to the new shoulder blade pain, instead of focusing on how the doctor missed something,"
No," you can just say something like this to yourself: ""I have been checked out by my doctor, ""my new body symptom does not mean ""I really have a medical illness. ""I have anxiety, and this is what I tend to think. ""Anxiety makes me believe I have something I don't. ""I am not more of a medical expert"
Environment," do something physical to distract yourself. Go for a walk or listen to music. Do some yoga exercises. Get a punching bag and beat it until you're tired. In my family growing up, my parents did their own landscaping, so there was always a need to move dirt or leaves"
Environment," from one part of the yard to the next. So their oldschool solution to boredom or upset was tell us to go outside and throw some dirt, or dig a hole. Now, as uninformed as this sounds, there is some merit to this. If you've never dug holes or thrown dirt,"
Environment," it's pretty grueling work, and if you have chest burning or a twitching eye muscle, that you're worried is cancer, if you go throw some dirt, the physical exertion and pain in your arm muscles will distract you from the twitching eye muscle. Because remember, random body sensations,"
No," that are not clearly connected to anything, are triggers for the anxiety. Lifting something heavy that makes your arm muscles sore makes sense, and that doesn't usually trigger the anxiety. What if after all that you come back in the house, you get showered up, and the you start back worrying again?"
No," This is not gonna passively go away. That's why taking a pill isn't really gonna get rid of this. It may help you if your anxiety, especially if it's so bad that you become too unglued to do therapy. But hey, if you've got the energy to go to 10 different doctors looking for answers,"
Environment," you can take some of that time to do these exercises to reprogram how you think, and how you react to your body. I hope this helps you. Please share this video, and let me know in the comments what you think. See you next time."
No," Mucus is a thick substance that lines your respiratory tract . It serves a very important role because it helps to protect your lungs from infection and foreign particles . However , when the body produces too much mucus , it can lead to a number of problems , including difficulty , breathing coughing and a runny nose . If you 've experienced excess mucus buildup , then you know just how frustrating it can be with that said , most people are unaware that the foods that they eat in their diet may actually be what 's causing excess mucus to accumulate in the airways of your lungs , which is why , In this video we 're going to look at the top foods"
No," that have been shown to cause an increase in mucus production be sure to watch until the end , because there 's one food that , i think will surprise you . So if you 're ready - let 's get into it , just a quick reminder : we are not doctors . This video is for informational purposes . Only . The first culprit that we need to discuss is brit . Bread is a staple in many diets , which is why you may be saddened to hear that it can cause an increase in mucus production . One study found that bread consumption was linked to chronic rhino sinusitis with nasal polyps , which are gross inside of the nose . The study found that people who ate more than two slices of white bread per day had"
No," higher rates of these symptoms . Researchers also found a link between bread , consumption and asthma . Their studies found that people who ate bread were more likely to experience asthma . Symptoms such as wheezing , chest , tightness and shortness of breath , next up on our list is processed meat . Processed meat is made up of meat that has been treated in some way to preserve it or enhance its flavor . This includes bacon ham , hot dogs , sausage and lunch meat . We included it here , because researchers found that eating processed meat was linked with an increased risk of copd , which is a condition that makes it more difficult to breathe . The study found that , for every 10 grams of processed meat eaten per day"
No," , the risk of copd increased by seven percent and one of the unfortunate side effects of copd is excess . Mucus production , another food that we should mention is sugar . It 'S been well documented that sugar is not something that should be included in a healthy diet , but to add fuel to the fire . A study found a link between sugar consumption and increased mucus production . The study looked at the effects of sugar on nasal mucus in healthy people and people with asthma . It found that both groups produced more mucus after eating sugar . The study also found that people with asthma had a greater response to sugar producing more mucus than the healthy participants ."
No," This suggests that sugar may play a role in exacerbating asthma symptoms and making the condition worse over time . Next . Up on our list is milk . It 'S no secret that milk is a good source of calcium and other nutrients , but milk has also been shown to cause mucus . A study found that drinking milk increased the production of mucus in the nose and throat . The study found that participants who drank milk had more mucus in their noses when they blew their nose and they were also more likely to have a sore throat . Milk was also linked with an increase in the number of colds people experienced fast food is yet another type that we need to discuss . It 'S no secret that fast food is unhealthy"
No," , but many are surprised to hear that it can increase the production of mucus . A study found that eating fast food was linked with an increased risk of developing asthma . The study found that , for every serving of fast food eaten per week , the risk of asthma increased by 18 and , as previously mentioned , one of the unfortunate side effects of asthma is excess , mucus production . But while we 're on the topic of things that are unhealthy , it leads to the next culprit on our list , which is soda just like fast food soda has also been linked with an increased risk of developing asthma and increased mucus production . The primary reason is that soda is loaded with sugar"
No," and other dairy products , sometimes our bodies are unable to break down and absorb a property known as lactose when this occurs . The body 's natural reaction is to produce more Mucus this can even lead to other problems such as diarrhea , constipation and nausea . Additionally , one commonality between many dairy products is the high level of saturated fat that they contain . Saturated fats are also believed to increase mucus production . Cheese is no exception , as it is made from the milk of cows , which contain a high level of saturated fat . Saturated fats cause the body to produce more mucus in order to protect itself from the harmful effects , and we could n't have made this"
No," Corn is another food that we need to discuss . It 'S a popular food item in many cuisines around the world and while it may seem like a harmless ingredient , some researchers believe that it can cause an increase in mucus production . A study found that subjects who ate corn protein had increased mucus along with more sneezing itching and a runny nose . The study also found that the subjects who ate corn protein were more likely to experience an asthma attack . While the study found that corn may cause an increase in mucus production , it is not clear if this is a major concern for most people . More research is needed in this area , but if"
No," you 're worried about corn causing mucus buildup , you may consider eliminating it from your diet . Next , up on , our list refers to foods that are high in sodium . Unfortunately , most americans are consuming far too much sodium in their diets . In fact , many of the common foods that we eat are packed with sodium and that could be leading to an increase in the production of mucus . The reason is sodium causes inflammation in the body which can lead to swelling . This causes the production of mucus to increase as a natural defense mechanism . A study found that participants who ate salty foods had more mucus and were also more likely to have a sore throat . Sodium was also linked with an"
No," increase in the number of colds people experienced . While it 's important to include some salt in your diet , it 's also important to be mindful of how much you 're eating if you 're , experiencing problems with mucus . It may be a good idea to limit your intake of salty foods , but real quick . If you do n't mind , do me a huge favor and hit the like button ?

No," educator . Let 'S begin what is spirituality , the spirituality is a broad concept with room for many perspectives . Some would refer spirituality to nature because of the innate properties that dwell naturally in our lives ."
No, Some would regard it as an art because it is impossible to explain that means . The experience of spirituality is highly subjective and personal spirituality is also associated to presence such as a godlike existence or someone else who is affecting one 's life . It is also
No," regarded as constant , in other words , it keeps on changing like your sense of purpose . Your personal definition of spirituality may change throughout your life , adapting to your own experiences and relationships . People may describe a spiritual experience , a sacred or"
No," transcendent , or simply a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness . Some may find that their spirit , spiritual life , is intricately linked to their association with the church , temple , mosque or synagogue . Others may pray or find comfort in a personal relationship"
No," connections to nature or art . Lastly , religion is one of the aspects of spirituality . It includes spiritual acts that are connected to higher being which form as an expression of spirituality . Nonetheless , there were a lot of confusions regarding spirituality and"
No," religion , while spirituality may incorporate elements of religion it generally broader . It is generally a broader concept . Religion and spirituality are not the same thing , nor are they entirely distinct from one another . The best way to understand this"
No," is to think of two overlapping circles like this in spirituality . The questions are : where do I personally find meaning connection and value in religion ? However , the questions are , what is true and right , where the circles overlap is the X is the individual"
No, experience which affects the way you think feel and behave how about the difference between spirituality and emotional health ? You will noticed in many articles in journals and practices recommended for cultivating spirituality are similar to those recommended for

No," of exercising regularly and eating a nutrientrich diet and treating yourself with compassion , lastly , is to make contemplative practice a part of your everyday life . The benefits of adopting a contemplative practice such as meditation prayer , yoga or journaling"
No," , have widespread effects , not just on spirituality , but on physical and emotional health as well . It is believed that if an individual has an increased spirituality , there will be an increased chance for him to give spiritual care to others . You might be asking what is"
No," spiritual care . It is when a healthcare professional attends to a person , spiritual or religious needs , as he copes with illness , loss , grief or pain , also is a professional responsibility and a vital aspect of patient care . We also have here initial steps in providing"
No," spiritual care . First is assessment of spiritual needs and second is utilization of spiritual resources . Spiritual needs or spiritual concerns are usually related to what we call the big questions of life and spiritual resources . Our practices , beliefs , objects"
Environment," third is to facilitate for all religious beliefs of faiths and fourth , advice ; leadership . To ensure the free exercise of religion also , I have here a conceptual model regarding the lived experiences of nurses on the provision of spiritual care based on the"
No," experiences of the nurses interviewed major themes emerge such as connection depends one spirituality , perceived healing outcomes , diversity of care And barriers in totality merging all themes or experiences of the nurses directs us to a phenomenon which is spiritual care"
No," the hands represent , creating connection . This means that the knowledge and experiences of giving spiritual care are translated into action , creating a human to human experience . The cross represents nurses , spirituality , as the nurse Minister , spirits well care to patients ."
No," care to their patients . To conclude our session on spirituality , I would like to leave a quote from Thomas Merton . You do not need to know precisely what is happening or exactly where it is all going . What you need is to recognize the possibilities and challenges offered by"
No," the present moment and to embrace them with courage , faith and hope do not put a lot of worries to the things that you can not change instead identify these challenges to improve ourselves personally and professionally . This is our life purpose ."
No," This gives meaning to our lives . It 'S our spirituality . This ends my presentation . Thank you . So much if you have any questions regarding this session , my email address , YouTube , channel and library . Access are found in this presentation . Also , if you find this video"
No," Welcome today , we do no webinar in integrating spirituality into your everyday care . My name is Jeanne wise , I 'm an executive officer with licensed practical nurses of Alberta . I 'M basing my discussion today on a study out of the University of Alberta , and I want to"
No," begin by giving credit to the research team that was led by Suzette Vermont Philips at the University . As in all , we do in Nursing Practice . What we do is grounded in evidencebased practice and so is integrating spirituality into our practice . That 'S why we 'll be basing this"
No," on research that has occurred today , we 're going to understand spirituality , assessing , in the context of the Alberta based research study , we 're going to apply a framework of spirituality assessment into our care , and I want to share with you and help . You understand"
No, the implications of integrating spirituality into everyday care . I wanted to start out with a case study . There was a middleaged man in his early 50s . He was considered to be palliative . He was admitted to the unit with weeks left . He was bed bound . He had limited use of
No," spirituality meant in the context of this study . We discussed it as being hope and meaning he agreed to take part , and I supported him to sign the consent as he could . He then turned and said to me , as I prepared to leave . All I really want is to feel the Sun on my face . One more time"
No," spirituality defined and for the purpose of the study it was seen as that which gives meaning and purpose to life . So in bringing this broad definition we found . Sometimes it was discussed in context of religion , some text , sometimes in context of spirituality , but sometimes people"
No," express what brought meaning and purpose to life outside of the definitions or other words that use spirituality and religion specifically and I 'll talk a little bit more as we progress . So really it 's what gives meaning and purpose , but it does n't have to be within any"
No," wanted to explore what some of the spiritual issues that you would see or consistently identified by patients . Some of these were being that patients felt that spirituality was amongst the most important aspect , yet it was under addressed in their care . They found it"
No," especially significant when dealing with endoflife issues or chronic and serious illness , and in also dealing with any spiritual . However , they defined spiritual to be suffering or stress . They found spirituality particularly important when making healthcare"
No," , as we do with many other assessments in nursing , can provide a means of engaging patients in spiritual conversations . It helps to explore the value of including spiritual screening in clinical practice , and our research aim to strive to answer that . We wanted to also determine the"
No," other interventions and it 's also to identify facilitators and challenges or barriers to incorporating spirituality into personcentered parables . In the study , there is three different phases : the first phase had to do with recruiting and educating healthcare"
Environment," bit of a sense . There 'S an age range from 53 to 92 . So you can see that that 's quite diverse , some had metastatic cancer or they were admitted with pain or weakness . Dementia Falls , injury , gastrointestinal concerns or COPD some were admitted with rehabilitation needs"
Environment," therapists , physiotherapists , physicians , nurses and social workers and their age range was approximately 30 to 59 years old , now the tool that we taught them and that phase one training was called the FICA tool . It uses an acronym to guide you through the question process . Now"
No," the focus of this study was n't to see what assessment tool worked the best it was really to see if we did some sort of assessment and spirituality , what kind of impact can we have and the patients and Families experience . So this study used this spiritual assessment tool to be"
No," used by the healthcare provider in assessing spirituality in the project participants or for those patients that consented and want to be a part of this study . This tool , it 's called the FICA , as I mentioned , is based on four areas of exploration and it asks exploratory"
No," questions . So the f means . What is your faith or belief , or do you consider yourself , spiritual or religious and know that some people may not respond or did n't want to respond necessarily to religious new religion because they may not consider themselves religious ? Some"
No," of them would understand the context of spirituality , but some ask questions like what . What exactly does that mean ? So sometimes this was a rephrase to just explore what gives meaning what gives hope to you . So it 's , however , that would fit in the"
No, conversation that you are having the I was exploring about how important that aspect is in their life . So what influence does it have on how you take care of yourself ? How have your beliefs that you shared influenced your behavior during your illness or maybe not a focus
No," on behavior , but just just influenced your experience during your illness and what role does some of these things play in your health ? The C is for community , so what influence does this have one on you or the group of people that you really love who are really important to you ? Is"
No," this a great ? Is you do have a community , that 's a great support to you and how do they support you ? Now we might see . Community is defined as many different aspects and it 's about allowing the patient to define spirituality or faith or belief or community the way they see"
No," and What brings you meaning and you 've told me how this brings importance to you , you 've told me about any community or family . That 'S a part of this now in a we 're gon na ask . How would you like me , your health care provider , to address these issues in your health care , or"
No," were some of the interventions that be included . They said you know we do a lot of support of listening and providing emotional support . We do some engaging with family and facilitating patient expression through different ways , but this study revealed some of the"
No," spiritual issues that were identified by both the patients and the health care professionals . They felt that there was also a need to be empowered to be courageous , to find where there 's hope and meaning and suffering that they 're experiencing . They also found that there"
No," expressed guilt , concerns about Grief and difficulty reflecting on some of the joys and the hopes and the values there was overshadowing by the illness that they were experiencing . Patients said that they reconsidered , regarding how significant others are people that they"
No," loved for were coping with the illness and with the loss . How it would affect them , they were coming to acceptance of their own illness and their own experience and their own mortality . Some expressed a fear of dying some felt that they were abandoned by God and some came"
No," want to bring to this that . Yes , that 's absolutely important and bringing this heart to the assessment . Assessing spirituality is very important and we have to learn when I referral to Spiritual Care is required , but it 's also not required in just a spiritual"
Environment, their everyday care . They felt it was important to acknowledge the family and importance in the patient 's life they used activity and exercise and humor in helping them to move through some of these interventions . So in this study we also looked at what
No," the strengths were in integrating an intervention to explore spirituality . We looked at it at different levels , we looked at it from the overall organization and we saw that there was alignment with the mission and vision and values of the institution and and"
No," what their goals and focus were . The leaders and the staff aligned . Well , with this mission , vision and values at the unit level , the organization employed , spiritual care professionals to offer support to patients and staff , and some clinical leaders could attend to and"
Environment," very committed to a personcentered approach to care that inherently imbued spirituality is essential , and we know in our training and in our education . Holistic assessments is very , very important . The health care professionals recognize the importance of getting to"
No," know and establishing and maintaining trust and moving forth with a holistic assessment that included spirituality as well . Health care professionals were aware of expected in actual professional competencies regarding spirituality . So , reflecting back on that holistic aspect"
No," do n't necessarily flow , as naturally or as comfortable for it with every . What we found at the patient level is that they felt this is the patient 's on the family . That spirituality is an absolute essential component of care . They desire to have their spiritualist"
No," issues to address and integrate it into their care . It allowed the patients to share their spiritual perspective and that enhanced the patient comfort level with a with the healthcare professionals , these spiritual discussions or discussions of meaning or hope whatever ."
No, It was in the context of the moment that you have the discussion . It provided an opportunity for the patients to reflect on how they feel as related to their illness and what they were experiencing . Your waistt some challenges in this study and incorporating spirituality
No," competing priorities . We know as as a nurse our day is filled with tasks , and sometimes they felt that it was really hard to incorporate spirituality into patient care . Many felt that we just had to stop what we were doing and saying : okay , I 'm gon na stop and do this specific"
No," spirituality discussion , but what they learned is sometimes it 's just threaded through the care you provide every day there was competing clinical demands , so physical care Needs to tend to take precedence over spiritual spiritual care needs , there 's an expression that"
No," need , or their own definition of spirituality or your own possible spiritual distress , can be a challenge if they do n't define it themselves , it might be difficult to help a patient find meaning or meaning of this within their lives , but as a"
No," religion based , maybe just for ignant an example but know that maybe that patient is n't religious so I 'm allowing them to define it within their own context . And I know we had one patient that defined it as physical activity . That 'S really what brought him unique , meaning so in that"
No," differently and really meet the needs of the patient . There is questions about the healthcare providers . What is my professional role ? Am I not violating some boundary well , it 's asking what brings meeting and hope to somebody . It 'S only a violation of boundaries if we 're"
No," of spirituality . I know in my experience I expressed to one of the patients . I talked to him about spirituality and he said , but I 'm not religious . I said . Okay , we look at spirituality as bringing hope and meaning . Is there something ? And he said - oh yes , so it 's just about having"
No," time and we worded in a better way . Okay , what can I do today to make a difference ? We saw a lot of opportunities at different levels , with integrating spirituality into care . So more of an intentional inclusion . As I mentioned many of us , do it every day in our care"
No," , but being very intentional to be attuned to this holistic sense and assessing spirituality . They felt a collaboration between clinicians and researchers . They were learning new ways to incorporate aspects into their care at the clinical level or the unit level . It enhanced"
No," patient and family satisfaction as well . The health care , professional satisfaction , patients and families started to perceive the interprofessional team . As being more at 10 and more respectful to the patient as a"
No," person , rather than focusing on those physical symptoms and just managing those physical symptoms , they felt increased professional satisfaction , professional satisfaction of the healthcare professionals . They felt that there was a continuity and attention of"
No, felt greater selfawareness in the areas of spirituality and allowing their patients to express the spirituality in the way they needed . They found opportunity to improve communication in the team and how to be empathetic and incorporate that into the care they felt
No, their family perspectives were respected . It it supported how the patient cold with the current situation and their transitions they were able to share and draw on personal spiritual resources . We found that there would identify any existential or spiritual suffering and
No," it allowed an opportunity to identify them and reduce some of the suffering and support , and it also helped to explore what additional spiritual resources are out there , even community , based or what 's on them . What 'S on the Union , what kind of specialization do we"
No," could dream , we suggested to develop strategies to ensure those needs and spiritual needs are routinely assessed and addressed . We also indicated is this also being a discharge or a transfer priority , just as physical symptoms often are so consider spiritual and"
No," psychosocial issues along with those physical needs ? As determinants for discharge a transfer , we said at the unit or the clinical level , we recommended that it broadens the awareness of spirituality and in the interprofessional teams . It 'S an"
Environment," units to to explore competencies and growth in this area for professional level . Mostly that will the health care providers here 's a huge opportunity here for education , so , as I said , there 's not one way to integrate spirituality or whatever they define that to be into"
Environment," boundaries with the patients . There was a lot of discussion in that and I know that I 've had discussions with other nurses around this and that 's a point of education as well , so we really have to protect ourselves , and we know we have our code of ethics and our standards of"
No," practice . We ca n't impose our values and beliefs on to our patients , so we really have to be aware of those professional boundaries . Remember it 's assessing them and their concept and their need . When it came to ethical distress , we recommended enhance opportunities for healthcare"
No," providers to receive supportive intervention in distressing cases and scenarios . We know some cases are very difficult and we too need to selfreflect and take care of ourselves , and we also recommended to involve family"
No," The nurse then sat with him and talked she used the spiritual assessment as a guide , but she let him talk about what he felt about this moment and moments to come . She opened up that discussion for him further charting reflected that the family felt so pleased with how their"
No," sibling was being cared for as they continued or the team continued to support his requests to include aspects of spirituality in his care , such as taking the time to Transfer him so the family could take him outside they arranged time to go to the hospital"
No, this study . She said she was burnt out . She found she was increasingly exhausted with less energy at the end of the day to care she felt that she was n't caring and nursing like she used to . This is the nurse that took the patient to the rooftop and she 's nursed that engaged
No," that 's in the discussion about spirituality . She shared with us that she realized that this is more than just a series of assessment questions she connected with the patient differently that day and she began to integrate this into more than just the patient , this"
No," patient that was involved into the study she started to Do it every day with all the patients that she cared for , it started to shift her perspective about her ability to care . She said that she was beginning to gain back energy and passion for her profession . Again , it"
No, and in our assessments that we 've done and in our interactions with our patients and just the impact of the quality of care . Of those conversations and holistic nursing in integrating and intentional spirituality assessment or conversation
No, some of those conversations . We do have our competency profile online and please note that you can contact us in our practice area . I want to thank you for joining me today in sharing how we can integrate spirituality into care
No," Transcriber: Katelyn Nicholson Reviewer: Nadine Hennig In the dark of the night, 4 a.m., I look over and my husband's not there. I look further, and I find him flat on his back, looking at the ceiling, arms out. ""Our lives are hollow and meaningless without children."" It had been twoandahalf years"
No," of hopes and prayers and failed fertility treatments. No one had come. And the despair that ripped through our hearts woke us night after night to the point where friends and family called just to see how we were doing. Because we so clearly were depressed. As a clinical psychologist and scientist, I had been trained to see that depression is a disease."
No," Much like cancer or diabetes, depression as a disease had symptoms of despair and isolation. And yet that simply did not explain the road we were traveling, nor did it explain the depression that follows loss of a spouse, miscarriage, trauma, or the natural transitions sophomore slump, midlife crisis, portholes in passages chapter breaks that seemed core to who we are"
No," were not aberrant illnesses. They were not diseases. And so my husband and I continued with each cycle ending in a disappointment that felt like a funeral. And as we continued down our road of trials, we started ever so gradually, over months and years to open our eyes from a dark and isolated place, quite alone,"
No," adopting all types of kids,"" opening up that new possibility. Listening to the helpers and healers opened my awareness, so that the next time I was woken in the night was not by the rip of depression, but by a great and clearly sacred presence a presence with a love so great and a gravitas that I sat up. And the presence said, ""If you were pregnant, would you adopt?"""
No," And I said something so awesome and great: the truth, which was, ""No"". But I also knew that this journey was more than a disease, and that this depression was opening the door on a path of ""becoming"" a spiritual path. Continuing down this path, I wanted that baby."
No," It was great that I was on a spiritual path, but I wanted that baby. And so we didn't quit. Up and down the East Coast to the best IVF labs in the country. We went so far as to find the team that invented IVF, and sitting there in solidarity on bed rest with my spouse, we found that the remote was stuck in our hotel room on one channel one interminable documentary, four hours"
No," of a little boy a little boy who stood in a garbage dump alone, and said, ""I don't care that I'm poor. I don't care that I can't go to school. But it hurts so much to not be loved that I sniff glue to make the pain go away."" And lying there in our multiple rounds of IVF, my husband and I looked at each other."
No," And he said it first. We knew there was a child out there for us. We made our way to a wise woman and hovered around her table, the daughter of a once clergyman. She looked at us and said, ""Frankly, what is it that you are looking for in your child?"""
No," And I leaned in and said, ""Well, I don't care if this is a boy or a girl. I don't care what race this child is. Just please, a child who can love."" And my husband jumped in and he said, ""Well yes, all that, but kind of a girl."" What we knew in common was that the voice that said you will never be parents, the voice that came from being alone in darkness was now a voice that said parenting is love."
No," It hurts so much to not be loved. All he wanted was a mom, all I wanted was a child. What would have made us family was love. Parenting was love. This was depression as a portal to a world of connection, a world of love, a world in which we walk a spiritual path. This was depression as only one side of the door."
No," And on the other [side of the] door was illumination, warmth, light, and spiritual path, a spiritual passage. Now, as a clinical scientist, it was clear to me that anything true through yet another human lense of knowing can be again shown. The certainty I had that depression and spirituality are two sides of one door"
No," seemed well within reach of science. And so my lab, together with that of Myrna Weissman and Brad Peterson and Rafi Bancell, did the science: two sides of one door where is it in the brain? Where is depression as the portal of the spiritual path, not the disease. And we found it. And we found it in broad and pervasive regions of the cortex."
No," We welcomed into our lab deeply depressed people from families loaded up with generations of depression, and similar people with families loaded up with generations of depression who through their journey of suffering had reached a foundationally spiritual path. People whose lead foot was now depression for having traveled the darkness. And what we found"
No," was that in precisely those regions of the brain which atrophied and withered in lifelong depression. For those people with a strong personal spirituality, there was a thickening of those very same regions. The cortex was thick as if you were looking at a tree in the Amazon versus a tree whithering under the cold and drought."
No," Two sides of one door is in us. Depression is not always an illness. It can be. We can need to be rebooted or recalibrated or medicated. It can be. But very often, depression as everyone will face it is core to our endowment, and core to our development. My husband and I continued now with this knowledge:"
No," that we were on the spiritual path in search of our child. It was clear that our suffering was not for naught, it was not an empty symptom, and with the awareness that we were ""becoming,"" the presence came back. The presence asked the same question in a deep and profound way. And my answer was honest, which is I am getting there."
No," I can feel we're down the road. There is the possibility of spiritually evolving into the person who would answer yes. But no, I'm not quite there where I would still adopt a child if I were pregnant. My love has grown, but is my love that great? Not yet."
No," And so we continued, and I found myself in the community of those who for generations have known that depression is but one side of the door, and spiritual awakening the other. Seated on the floor of the ""Inipi"", the sweat lodge, among the Lakota in South Dakota, I joined the circle of women. And here, each woman talked about the suffering which had brought her"
No," to our collective prayer. 'My son, he's 40. He has not come home to his family.' 'My son, he's 14, and he's starting to use substance.' I, in turn, shared that I was searching for my spiritual child. Together, we prayed and we sent it up. We sent our prayer both for one another, ourselves and the collective, up to Great Spirit, ""Wananchi."""
No," That night, a call came. They had found him, that very night on the other side of the earth. We have found the Miller's child was the message. There are great girls and we can sure find you a girl, but this is the Millers child, and this is a son. This time, clinical science had something to say to the spiritual path."
No," When we looked at the women who, through suffering, had come to a spiritual path, with nice thick cortexes, they also had another quality: the back to their head gave off a certain wave length of energy that we call ""Alpha."" And it's also found on the back of the head of a meditating monk. Alpha has another name, it's Shuman's constant."
No," had the anxiety of actually meeting him, finding him, bringing him home. And then one day, the FedEx came and we peeled it open and there was the video. We popped it in and the most joyous little boy, full of happiness, arm around the nurse a love like I had never felt lifted me up,"
No," and any remnant of depression were shards on the ground. And together, my husband and I went to bed as parents. That night, the presence came back the great sacred presence for the third time. ""If you were pregnant now, would you adopt?"" ""Yes, I found my spiritual son, yes."" And that night, we conceived naturally"
No," medicine and spirituality , medicine And spirituality comprise many different themes . Our focus today , however , is going to be an introduction to spiritual history , taking as a way of assessing the role of spirituality"
No," , and that profound trust can lead to a whole new Way of accompanying a given patient , medicine and spirituality welcome before we go any further , let me offer you my contact information and feel invited feel invited to reach"
No, spirituality . I want to add at the outset that the lecture you 're about to participate in has been revised substantially for the academic year 2022 through 2023 . The original lecture has been now divided into three lectures
No," , this being the first of those three , the other two pertain more appropriately to the spirituality of the caregiver and the caregiver 's reflective practice . This lecture on spiritual history is more pertinent to your patientcentered medicine . One experience"
No," what i 'm going to do is try to provide you with a very practical approach to assessing the role of spirituality in the life of the patient , an approach that ought to work regardless of the patient 's faith , tradition or"
No," perhaps in the context of no faith Tradition at all , you might ask about comparative religions and the treatment of death and dying . These are very , very specific topics that are beyond our scope , because our approach today is going to be that"
No, of offering you a practical way of understanding the role of spirituality in the patient 's life and addressing it as the patient sees fit to have it addressed . I want to add as well that all the scientific studies that i 'll be using
No," Let me add further before we go any further , that this lecture is not my opinion . It 'S simply not a reflection of what i think you should know about medicine and spirituality , but it 's actually"
No," medicine and spirituality , noting That students of medicine student physicians , medical students will be aware of the need to incorporate awareness of spirituality and cultural beliefs and practices into the care of patients in a variety"
No," of clinical contexts . So it 's their expectation that medical schools throughout the united states will address medicine and spirituality on some level , consistent with what the double amc recommended back in 1999"
No, concluded the following and i 'll remind you that a metaanalysis looks at the totality of the literature on a given subject and makes a determination about the quality of that evidence and then comes to a consensus
Environment, about that evidence . This metaanalysis concluded that it 's vital that medical training should incorporate evidencebased approaches regarding the associations of spiritual community with patient outcomes
Environment," that it 's vital , that medical training increase spiritual awareness among health professionals that it 's vital that medical training recognize spirituality as a social factor associated with health . So this comes"
No," here are the objectives that we 're going to follow . There are five of them , they are in question format and we will transition in this order from an understanding of what is spirituality through the usefulness of spiritual"
No," a spiritual history in the setting of serious mood disorder . So the patient asks the attending physician . Well , what is spirituality anyway ? What is spirituality , how would you respond to that patient 's question ? What is"
No," spirituality to answer that question , we 're going to pause for a moment and consider the concept of the transcendent the transcendent is that which is beyond myself . It 'S that backdrop of all human"
No," is asking about something that is a value beyond themselves beyond themselves . The answer to these questions is not merely a fact , but is a valueladen response . These"
No, spirituality to be the contours or the lines of my relationship with or connection to the transcendent and i engage in this relationship or connection with the transcendent . I engage my spirituality in order to find
No," meaning in the midst of experience , and so my spirituality actually becomes a portal . A portal to meaning again spirituality , describes the contours of my relationship with or connection to"
No," that which is beyond me , and i engage this relationship or connection . I engage my spirituality in order to find meaning in the midst of experience such that spirituality becomes a portal"
No," make that turn , i engage my spirituality , which is a particular way of relating to the transcendent , a particular way of connecting to god . In this instance , and so through my spirituality , i begin to find meaning in crisis in crisis i find meaning . So in the midst"
No," of crisis , i quite naturally turn to the transcendent , and , as i do that i engage the transcendent through my spirituality , a particular understanding of connecting and all of this . All of this is in"
No," service of finding meaning in the midst of experience , especially in the midst of crisis , now important to take a step back and look at three terms : spirituality , religion and faith , because often they 're used interchangeably"
No," the individual using them to clarify what each of them means for you , but , strictly speaking , they do not mean the same . We'Ve identified spirituality as the way of connecting or a way of connecting to the transcendent . However , the transcendent"
No," is understood . It 'S that way of connecting in order to find meaning in experience . Religion and faith are related to spirituality , but they 're , not identical with it . Strictly speaking , religion refers to an organized set of communityendorsed"
No," beliefs and codes and practices . Sometimes a religion will give rise to a spirituality , but religion is a very organized set of communal , endorsed , beliefs , codes and practices ."
No," Faith is an even more fluid term than religion , because faith can sometimes be used as a synonym for religion or it can be used as a synonym for belief in the transcendent or even the strength of that belief . It 'S not"
No," uncommon in certain traditions to hear someone say that a particular person is a person of faith or a person of great faith , so faith tends to be a very , very fluid term , religion , less so religion , less so again , these both"
No," refer to things that are Related to spirituality , but not perfectly synonymous with spirituality , and so to summarize , what is spirituality spirituality is the way we relate to the transcendent . It 'S the way we"
No," bear butte , has long been a place , certainly among the oglala lakota , where the vision quest is often held a kind of special retreat . That 'S typical of native american religion among the oglala lakota ."
No," to the second world war and the life of victor frankl ? Viktor frankl is an austrian psychiatrist , jewish who was imprisoned in four different concentration camps by the nazi regime and in each of those camps he witnessed the death of a close family"
No," into how the patient seeks , meaning in the midst of suffering . Remember that spirituality is ultimately about finding meaning finding meaning by turning toward the transcendent in the midst of suffering . In the midst of an experience of one kind or another"
No," the whole idea of Medicine and spirituality to be offputting , then that will almost certainly color your willingness to inquire about a patient 's spiritual life or to appreciate it on any level or any level at all . So you want to really"
No," examine your own interior landscape and note how you yourself respond to the notion of medicine and spirituality , having anything to say to one another . If a physician understands a patient 's spirituality , then they understand"
No," something about how that patient seeks , meaning and if a physician understands a patient 's spirituality , they can empower patients , meaning making and healing in some ways that they might not otherwise be able to do ."
No," , the scientific literature regarding medicine and spirituality , a study from 1998 demonstrated that data data from religious commitment and health status , a review of the research and"
No," implications for family medicine data published in the archives of family medicine in 1998 , suggests that religious commitment may play A beneficial role in not only preventing illness"
No, but improving one 's ability to cope with it and facilitating recovery . So we begin to see that there 's a connection between spirituality and health outcomes .
No," Interestingly , however , there seems to be a divergence between a patient 's attitude about spirituality or patients . Attitudes about it generally and physicians attitudes , and what do i mean by that ? What do i mean by a divergence between patients"
No," were open to having a physician inquire about spirituality and they believed it would actually strengthen the physicianpatient relationship . On the other hand , only 15 recalled ever being asked by a physician about their"
No," spirituality . So , on the one hand , you have physician patients suggesting that this would be helpful , that a spiritual history would be helpful and on the other hand , you really do n't have physicians harmonizing"
No," with those patient desires . There is a divergence in attitude here . Consider another study . This was published in the annals of family medicine in 2004 , 921 responders , patients in a family medicine clinic participated and 83 of them"
No," in a clinical setting , i will tell you : i 've never been asked about my spirituality . No one has ever taken my spiritual history , and you might ask yourself : has anyone ever taken your spiritual history ? Have you ever had your spiritual history"
No," we could summarize because it promotes relationship , it strengthens the physicianpatient relationship and it can empower healing in some new ways and it seems to have prognostic value . There seems to be a connection between"
No," spirituality , a patient 's spirituality , the depth of that spirituality and their ability to cope with illness and maybe their ability to recover from it . Well , we press on to the third vignette , so imagine you 're shadowing in the"
No," by data . In this study from the annals of family medicine in 2004 , you can see that patients are open to discussing spirituality , they 're open to you taking a spiritual history in the setting of serious illness . Almost"
No," everyone when they 're admitted to the hospital , almost everyone if they 're experiencing chronic pain , that 's certainly a majority of patients or if it 's the initial visit , you can see that 60"
No," patients who are wrestling with major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder or a combination of both , and it 's often in that very stressful setting that i find myself taking a spiritual history"
No, make up this fica fica acronym f refers to the question : do you consider yourself a spiritual person at all ? That 'S often the first question or how important is your spirituality ? That would be a followup question . What
No," spiritual community are you a member of a member of another followup question , then the final followup question is : how would you like me to address your spiritual concerns ? Think of the the"
No," of the visit is going to be . How would you feel about engaging your spirituality as you navigate this crisis , this disease ? How would you feel about finding a way to engage your spirituality"
No," , i 'm not prescribing prayer , i 'm simply asking the patient . If there 's a way , they can engage , their spirituality recruit it as an ally as they 're , making their way through a difficult time"
No, use their spirituality to seek meaning in the midst of crisis . And then that leads quite organically to a conversation of how they might engage their spirituality . In the midst of this difficult time that they 're going through
No, spirituality and the life of spirituality in the patient 's wellbeing . So how does a physician take a spiritual history ? You can use the adapted fica model as part of the psychosocial history . If this
No," in the midst of a health care crisis , let 's consider our final vignette . After taking your first spiritual history in the community health clinic , which is a clinic where many second year , students typically work , you consider the resources available to"
No," you for the spiritual support of the patient . What are some of the resources available to you as the caregiver to support spiritually the patient ? What are they well , of course , the first spiritual"

No," with respect to prayer , for example , praying with patients . I know some colleagues who pray with patients , some of them actually initiate the prayer and in other instances they allow the patient to initiate the prayer with"
No," respect to praying with patients . Again , you have to find your level of comfort . Is it something you 're comfortable doing ? I never pray with patients unless i 'm invited to do that ."
No," So what are the resources available for the spiritual support of the patient ? Well , of course , the physician and then the patient , spiritual community and then the spiritual professionals , the spiritual care staff which you may have"
No," others , spirituality and serious illness and health , because it is a metaanalysis . It looks at all of the literature . That 'S been published about medicine and spirituality , especially spiritual history , taking , and draw some important conclusions from the empirical data , as"

These growth factors also encourage the abundance and survival of new blood cells , keeping the brain healthy indirectly , it improves brain activity which also improves mood and sleep and reduces stress and anxiety problems . So physical exercise has been proven to have some of the following effects . Number one boosts the memory studies conducted on the hippocampus among children , adults and the elderly showed that the brain structure grew after aerobic exercise . The hippocampus is part of the brain that holds the memory and is therefore crucial for learning number two improve"

Environment," The quality improvement is a systematic approach to enhancing patient 's safety outcomes and their experience of care . It generally involves applying a method systematically , but it 's also a way of working that engages everyone working in an organization . It 'S about a continuous"
No," effort to make and test improvements . We'Ve seen a growth in the use of quality improvement approaches in the NHS and the Kingsland wanted to learn more about the opportunities to use those quality , improvement , approaches in mental health care settings as well . Two"
No," of the case studies featured in our report are TSS can , where values , NHS foundation , trust and East London . A NHS Foundation , Trust and they 've both been doing this for some time , and we 've asked them to share some of the key insights into what they 've learned along the way ."
No," reducing the need for inpatient admissions , whether it 's a community team seeing people quicker and making sure that people feel Engaged with the treatments that they 're being offered , there 's so many stories of people receiving a better experience , an outcome"
No," of care . Even though the recent years we 've had increased demand on services , particularly our children 's services . Through our improvement work , we 've been able to make sure that we continue to make sure that people are n't waiting for care and treatment , because we know that"
No," waiting really makes people worried and can make things worse , whereas getting in early can really help people . So we 're really proud that we 've been able to do that . I think a lot of the work we 've done around sharing of information with patients and their family has been"
No," access and they can sign up to as learners on the online recovery course and also the sharing of information we 've done with Gps , I think , is really benefitted service users , their families and our other partners in the healthcare . The staff here also , I think , have a"
Environment," at the heart of quality improvement is all about services and care involvement and when we 're running quality improvement activities , we provide the same training to experts by experience and service users , who will be part of the quality improvement work as a would"
No," to staff , and - and That 'S really the joy in all of this , so when you see a group of staff service users and their families , all working together on the same project making improvements together , that 's where you know that things are really moving and shaping and"
No, receiving the care . And then you need to think about when you have work happening at scale . How you spread from one place that sold a problem trying to take that learning to other places and again the beauty of a method ? Is it gives you a way to do this
No, systematically and thinking about the core components that are going to lead to success ? For so spread from one place to another to another : it 's not a project . It 'S not a piece of work ! That 'S going to last for two or three years . It 'S really something that organizations need to
No," about what you do as a team , rather than add it on to something it 's got to be about taking things away as well , so you know , I hope our teams are starting to Now think , do we still need all of our business meetings ? Do we still need our governance meetings to function in the"
No," Well , welcome to the MedCram lecture we 're going to talk about pneumonia , which is a pretty big topic today . Pneumonia is very common , so you do have to know about it and you do see it quite a bit in the inpatient setting and you also see it in the outpatient . Setting . Pneumonia globally affects about 450 million people a year . That 'S a huge amount of people . That 'S about seven percent of the population . It turns out that out of those 450 million people who develop pneumonia there 's only about four million deaths , so we do treat these"
No," things , especially men with antibiotics and specifically with vaccines which we 'll talk about a little bit today . We'Re going to talk about the diagnosis , the symptoms signs and how we treat pneumonia and some key things that may come up on tests that you 'll be able to use for your advantage . Okay , so the first thing you got to know is what is a pneumonia and you see know the lungs kind of look like this got the right upper lobe . You'Ve got the right middle lobe , the right , lower lobe and the left side as well , and they branch off to all"
No," and put oxygen into the red blood cells . Okay , so you 've got an infection there . So what you should see is number one : you should see a fever , although not always number two . You should have an elevated whitebloodcell count and then finally number three . You should see an infiltrate on the xray . Well , the fever we get from taking the temperature a WBC . We get from ordering something called the complete blood count and an infiltrate we get by ordering a chest xray . But what are the other signs that we 'll see ? Well , people"
No," will have fevers we 'll have chills . They will feel if they 're young they 're gon na have pulmonary symptoms . So that 's one thing that you should know is in the young population and in the old population . What do we see in the young population you 're more likely to see things like shortness of breath ? Cough ? In other words , respiratory symptoms pain in the chest ? Okay , whereas the old might just be confused sleepy so , in other words , more nonspecific symptoms in the elderly population , whereas more respiratory specific in the younger"
No," population . Okay , the other thing that you 've got to know , that 's just really important is where these patients coming from . So there 's something called community and then there 's something that 's called healthcare acquired . The reason why this is important is because there are different bacteria that are associated with each of these there 's bacteria , that 's associated with the community , which we 'll talk about and there 's bacteria associated with healthcare . For instance , Pseudomonas and Mrs A which require completely different"
No," antibiotics . Generally speaking , the thing that 's going to divide this is : if the patient has come from a health care facility into your Hospital , then it 's going to be a healthcare acquired infection . If , on the other hand , it 's from a community , then they would be coming in from like from their home or from their and complex . If the patient is already admitted to the hospital and they 're developing an infection in the lung after 72 hours , then that would be a healthcare acquired okay . So , let 's go"
No," through some key points here to kind of read through this , so we 've already decided that an infection in the lung is a pneumonia . Let 'S look at a little bit more of the history of the patient . Okay . So if you see a patient who has been bed bound , I want you to think of an infection with Klebsiella . That 'S a Klebsiella . Pneumoniae is a specific type of bacteria . If your patient has COPD , then I want you to think of Hamas influenza , that 's the classic one ! If the patient 's been exposed to sheep in the field , then I want you to think about Q"
No," fever , hey . These are associations that I want you to have . If the patient is a bird handler , then I want you to think about . Psittacosis psittacosis is a condition . That 'S associated with Birds , chlamydia psittacosis , if you are a hunter , specifically a rabbit hunter from Arkansas , but it could be any kind of hunter . I want you to think of tularemia . If there 's something about bat caves in the question stem , then I want you to think about . Histoplasmosis , okay , if the patient is in the Central Valley of California or they mentioned something"
No," about California , the thing I want you to think about is coccidia mycosis , which is a fungus and then , if they mentioned something about Chicago or the Mississippi Valley . I want you to think of blasto mycosis okay , so these are again histories that you might get in the patients who are coming in with these symptoms that we 've already talked about . Something else that you might see on history is the onset okay . If it 's abrupt think about typical pneumonia , that 's typically what happens if it , however , is"
No," insidious . I want you to think of atypical now , epical . Typically , it has an infection that comes on dramatically . It comes on fast . You have fevers chills and you 're sick very quickly . Atypical , on the other hand , is not as severe comes on gradually and that type of onset is associated with different bacterial organisms . Atypical organisms versus typical organisms . Now the typical organism , as you 'll know , is the streptococcal pneumonia and that one has actually gone down quite a bit in the last few years and that 's because"
No," of what 's been going on with the vaccine . So let 's talk about that a little bit . So there are two different vaccines in the United States that we 're using . Currently it 's the the polyvalent 23 , which has been around for some time and the Prevnar 13 polyvalent 23 is also known as the ppsv23 and the Prevnar 13 is also known as PCV 13 . So the polyvalent 23 . I think you should know that it 's used as a polysaccharide and because of that , it 's not a protein . Protein is what 's required to make memory cells . So there 's no memory cells here with the"
No," to 65 years of age , if they do a couple of things if they smoke or if they have asthma , okay , so there still is a role for the polyvalent vaccine . Now the Prevnar has a dipteroid protein in it and what that means is you get memory cells ? So that 's pretty good and it 's currently recommended for all children younger than five years old , so from zero to five years of age and all adults , 65 plus - and this has been a recent thing here in 2014 - is that anyone 65 years or older get it and People who are six to 64 if they have certain medical conditions"
No," it was n't until way out here in 2014 - was it finally approved for them and we 're hoping that we 'll see a even bigger decline . So it looks as though the decline in adults adults over than 65 years of age , so the red here is greater than 65 and the blue is less than 5 . It looks as though there was some herd effect , so we talked about what pneumonia is . What the symptoms are and some of the specific ideologies and how to tell them in the history , and then we went over a little bit about the vaccines for invasive pneumococcal disease . When we"
No," Today we will talk about periodic chest pain , pleurity , chest pain is a type of sharp and stabbing pain that gets worse when you breathe in and even worse . When you take a deep breath , it 's often caused by problems with the thin layers of tissue that surrounds the"
No," lungs and this tissue is called the pleura . It 'S exacerbated by deep breathing , as we said earlier , and also coughing , sneezing or laughing when pleuritic inflammation occurs near"
No," the diaphragm pain can be referred to the neck or shoulder and pulmonary embolism is the most common , potentially lifethreatening cause . It 'S found in five to twenty percent of patients who present to"
No," the emergency department with pleuritic pain , but we have some other important diseases that can cause periodic chest pain and those are 4p . The first one is pneumothorax pneumothorax is when air"
No," gets trapped between the lung and the ribcage and smoking , and some lung infections can cause pneumothorax . Second , one is pleural effusion , it occurs when fluid builds up in the space between the lung and the rib cage ."
No," Third , one is pleuritis , it 's a medical term for inflammation of the pleura . Lastly , we have pericarditis it 's a term for inflammation of the tissues around the heart . Of course , we have other diseases that can cause pleuric chest pain , but these are some"
No," Have you been experiencing shortness of breath , a persistent cough , yellow or green mucus fatigue , a penis and or a fever ? If so , then you may have been suffering from a chest infection , but just know that you are not alone in this condition . Chest infections are common"
No, and often appear after or along with the flu or a common cold . Sometimes the symptoms can be severe other times they 're mild and can go away on their own . But did you know that there are some natural treatments that you can use to help speed up the process in this video
No," on a solution of lemon honey and warm water is a classic home remedy that is widely used across the world . It 'S useful in alleviating sore throat , symptoms that are caused by repeated coughing studies show that honey reduces call symptoms because of its antimicrobial and"
No, to spend any extra of your hardearned money . Number four : try : herbal remedies from the ginger family when it comes to food based natural home remedies for a chest . Infection ginger is a great one to consider . The roots of a ginger plant are widely used for food and natural
No," that can help relax the airways and the lungs and fight against fever that occurs during a chest infection so adding ginger to your diet and taking it in the form of juice or drinking it in your teeth can naturally help treat your Body for a chest , infection number 5 use"
No," natural , essential oils using naturally extracted essential oils such as eucalyptus , lemongrass , rosemary and sandalwood can be effective methods for treating a chest infection . You can use these oils either by inhalation , via diffusers vaping or by topical"
No," application in the form of a natural vapor . Rub studies show that aromatherapy via the inhalation of essential oils , can help treat upper chest infections by diminishing nasal congestion and reducing the spasms that occur with a repeated cough . High quality diffusers"
No," the accumulation of mucus and phlegm in the chest and Airways , which can lead to shortness of breath , discomfort and sometimes wheezing . The human body uses coughing as a natural mechanism to get rid of excess mucus , but sometimes natural coughing is just not enough . This"
No," me wrong , natural remedies are great , but if the symptoms are too severe or unbearable , this is when you can look into some overthecounter medications that can help they come in various forms such as vapor , rubs , pain , relievers and decongestants . Vapor rubs are easily"
No," available and can provide quick relief from chest . Congestion and cough just simply apply the ointment to the chest : throat upper back forehead or around the nose for shortterm relief . If achiness or headaches become a problem during the chest infection , you can take a pain"
No," relief such as ibuprofen , because it 's an antiinflammatory drug that can subside a fever along with any accompany pain . Another overthecounter medication that you can consider is a decongestant which can help clear the Airways of mucus and"
No," Apart from these remedies , preventative measures like avoiding smoking and maintaining proper personal hygiene are also very beneficial , and if you do have a chest , infection practicing social distancing is essential in order to prevent the chances of spreading it to"

No," Look at this a job ! That 'S still here , after 2 , 000 years , money changer , this famous scene from the Gospels Jesus - sees the money changers in the temple . He overturns their tables and drives"
No," them out of the Temple . Everybody 'S always been interested in the commotion Jesus caused , but I want to know what all these people were doing at the temple that day and what they all did for a living . What were their jobs like and what drove"
No," The cacophony of sounds the animals animals walking around the dung in the street . I was thinking it must have stunk . It would have to we 're gon na go into one of the houses here notice , as we step inside through the door we 're actually outside in this"
No," This is hard . Is it common to have a small child in the workplace ? Absolutely Judaism taught that if you do n't train your son in a profession , you 've abandoned them . Basically we 're in a carpentry shop . Most famous job in the world I mean is this : oh Jesus would have"
No," many gods , and liberal ideas was very different from how the Jewish people lived and how they prayed to one God . So the young Jesus lived right at the intersection of traditional Jewish culture and the urban life of the occupying Romans ."
No," as the most finely cut , so I 'm thinking a bureaucrat some kind of bureaucrat . In fact , I would guess we 're looking at a magistrate right . We come into the opulence . That 'S right . His office , I presume there was a pool right over here . That 'S a pool , that 's a pool . There was"
No," So the Romans did n't just occupy . They influenced many of the Jewish people . Many of them were hellenized or romanized , absorbing Greek and Roman culture right here in the busy city of sephorus . So what was it like here ?"
No," major city right in the ancient world . The gospels tell us that , when Commerce threatened to take over the life of the temple , Jesus , cracked , the whip and the seeds for that rage could have been sown here at sephorus . Where Jesus was likely getting his hands dirty while"
No, overturned the money changers table . Some of the people in the temple were likely farmers . They would have come here to bring their first crops as an offering of thanks with your life dependent on your crops and animals . You figure everyone would
No," his land . So , do you mean that farmers and and Shepherds would compete are not friends , especially if you have those goats beyond their use ? Is food in biblical times , goats were also used for temple sacrifices . These money , changers that Jesus Will"
No," confront , are converting foreign currency and one of the reasons pilgrims needed . The local currency is so that they could buy animals to sacrifice in the temple , but before they meet their fate as lunch or sacrifice"
No," you like to do that sure , let 's give it a try ? Okay , what let 's go ! I think you forgot one ! Oh yes , did you see that Champion Shepherd ? Is it terrible that I 'm thinking lamb , kebabs right about now for the biblical farmer , the most"
No," important task was growing enough food for his family animals provided crucial help , plowing the fields and growing staple foods ? No wonder the Bible mentions animals . So often they were life and Lifeline . Your mule , your cow , whatever animal you had is"
No," really your friend . She knows you the most important thing in my world . She is yes because everything depends on her . Yes , but in the Bible , is n't there a reference to plowing a straight line ? Jesus says to his followers : if you follow me , do it like you were"
No," from the time of the Bible right up to today for the Jewish people , unless you 've broken bread , you have n't had a meal and in the Holy Temple beyond the courtyard , where The sacrifices were held was the sanctuary ."
No," by the way you know that it was very hard job , but this is also a place of encounters . Women found their spouses really , yes , the most important encounters happened by a Wella resistor , so this is like all the important marriages . This is the first century hanging . This is the"
No," try and do this job , I 'm in Israel learning about jobs in the time of Jesus and there 's a pretty important job . You ca n't miss if you read the New Testament , because at least four of the Disciples of Jesus were fishermen"
No," The TV viewers will be glad that I I did n't try that experiment , but that 's a little too much these people , I mean fishing in ancient times around here . The are they are they poor ? No , not at all . This is the most stable industry for this area ."
No," rebellion , a revolution and that takes cash as well as belief . We'Re seeing a transition between the Old Testament and the new and jobs are one of the key differences in the South . The farmers and Shepherds of the Bible are at the mercy of the"
No," this . I 'M here in the ancient city of betchian - and all I can say , is wow this place is incredible . It is beautiful , it 's massive and I 'm thinking that at its height it must have been incredibly opulent . Everybody has that reaction , their mouths"
No," just drop open . They think you know am I in Rome or Greece , and here we are in Jewish Roman Palestine . This area has been inhabited for over 9 000 years and no wonder Two Rivers converge here in the Lush Jordan Valley , making for a plentiful"
No," , there 's no mercy . You could go to jail , you could lose your land , you know , maybe you own a family plot of land and all of a sudden uh . It 'S uh given over to some rich landowner and were people killed for this ? Was there execution for not paying your taxes ? We"
No," the city absolutely could not do without it , for instance , in Jerusalem they had to have frankincense . Without it there could be no Temple worship . Why not ? What is frankincense anyway and where does it come from ? I'Ve , come to the Negev Desert to trace"
No," , I 've been learning about the jobs all these people did in biblical times and how their professions could have brought them all to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem . On that day , there was another very important job practiced by those who were already at"
No," the temple priest , priests were the link between the people and their God . Performing animal sacrifices and burning a special incense called frankincense as an offering frankincense begins as a tree resin from"
No," sure it 's very beautiful frankincense ? That 'S beautiful , it 's good for smell good for memory , good for anything , because that many people before 2015 years ago he 's put all of this in his home so two thousand years"
No," make to God . It 'S still burned in churches . Today and two thousand years ago , pilgrims coming to Jerusalem and entering the temple would have inhaled its sweet fragrance three times a year . The Jewish people"
No," came to the temple from all over the world for the major festivals , I 'm in Old Jerusalem , and this is the Western Wall . It 'S the only above ground structure . That 'S left of the temple that the Romans destroyed ."
No," The Temple Mount is the holiest place in Judaism , and the Western Wall is its only physical remnant . Just up here on Temple mount the very first temple was built about a thousand years before Jesus was born . People come here 365 days a year , 24"
No," hours a day to pray in the Square . Many of them write prayers on small scripts and place them in the wall . Others kiss the wall , animal sacrifices to the temple , but they did n't bring a goat or a dove with them Halfway Around the World"
No," It was n't the job it was where the job was located inside the temple , this crowded city of pilgrims attracted merchants of every kind . It was a good place for business , but Jesus did n't want the temple turned into a business and some say the priests"
No," were allowing it to happen . I want to find out more about this job , which was , unlike any other , an answer to a boss , unlike any other in the pressure cooker of Jerusalem . How did these priests balance , religion , Commerce"
No," , Rome and the first century rebel ? In the time of the Bible , Jerusalem was as busy as it is today . Three times a year , pilgrims came from all around to offer sacrifices in the temple that used to be Beyond this wall ."
No," Jerusalem 'S pilgrims were great for local jobs , then , and now . There were food vendors , they were hostile owners and there were merchants of every kind . But , unlike today there were thousands of priests who served in the temple ."
Environment," Priests were in the temple to represent the people before their God and nothing could interfere with them performing their holy functions . The most important functions were performed by the high priest , but under Roman occupation . There was plenty of"
No, being able to do their job . So here you can see one of the gates which led into the temple area . This is the place where all the pilgrims who had been purified in a salon pool and including the priests who come from the upper City would enter into the temple .
No," So everybody comes right through here exactly and it must have been a pretty chaotic scene if you 've got all these people coming in and fairly cacaotic . But you had a very , very strict Administration and had that the temple administrators . They would make sure that"
No," only those who had been purified in the pools were allowed into the temple . Everyone had to immerse in a special pool called a Mikvah before entering the Holy Temple . The purpose was for physical cleanliness , but for ritual purity"
No," there were large mikvahs for the pilgrims like this one . The pool of Siloam mentioned in the New Testament and recently discovered near where the temple stood and the water was on different levels . So um , whenever the pool was at a lower"
No," all these people sitting around and they 've all come here in order to purify themselves . Before going up to the temple , it was critical that priests become pure before entering the temple . One became impure by coming into contact"
No," impure when they entered the temple , everything they were trying to accomplish in the prayers of their people would fail . There were , and still are , strict rules about what kind of water could be used in a ritual bath ."
No," indicating that this was a house which belonged to the Priestly family . I mean these were the neighbors of King Herod , the Great and subsequently of the the Roman governors of Jerusalem , because the Roman governor was situated just up a slope from where we are . Jerusalem was a"
No," was n't only in the temple they needed to be pure everywhere . They went in the city of God when Jesus overturned , the tables of the money changers . These priests would have felt that he was overturning their world , the delicate balance they had achieved"
No," between their God and the Romans , and here in his house we can touch this man 's life . This vanished job Temple priest , but this is extraordinary by doing their jobs and finding out about their everyday lives ."
No," I'Ve learned a lot about all the people who would have converged on the temple on a fateful day . In the first century , my name is Aaron kislenko . My day , job is teaching history , but now I want to live it . So I 've come here to Israel to find out what life was like at the time of"
No," given this approach to surgery . It 'S understandable why you might pin your hopes on a miracle worker like Jesus rather than go under the knife now these are leeches , obviously sure they would use this to bloodlet same principle of Nations . This same"
No," feel like I 'm in a science fiction movie , all of a sudden because you are , do you feel any pain , he 's stabbing me yeah he 's having lunch yeah ? What kind of ailments would they have used this for and they use it for anything and in all parts of the body they were using"
Environment," would have used clay cups or animal horns and for some ailments they also used a variety of herbs , because the climate has n't changed that much around here in 2000 years , many of those herbs are still growing today"
No," quite a strong laxative Ramos ramnus . This is from the sage family , which is called balota balota . They use for lung problems for lung disease . It 'S also a kind of mental relaxant . Sharon shows me some of the herbs that they would Chew in biblical times"
No," This is the head of goats black ghosts and it does n't . We took the head of the goats and we make it together and what does it do and it does n't there 's ? No medicine , so if you 're a migraine , you just circle around your head , a little bit pain , yeah yeah , so you will not"
No," people are in a good remission after treatment is a dead sea for at least eight to nine months , something that is pretty good for any kind of other treatment . So it is fantastic to see that without drugs without medicine we can reach at least the same result than with"
No," everything else , but in biblical times prayer was the first thing you did even today , some people pray when they get sick and some Studies have shown it may work . The most famous scientific study , showing"
No," the Commandments dealing with things like , like your physical health , your your public health , absolutely , and it 's interesting that many of the laws of ritual Purity have shown to have the side benefits that have been very beneficial in terms of hygiene And"
No," you 're clean , but the purpose of ritual bath was not to clean yourself physically , but to unclog yourself spiritually at the time . Belief in spiritual Purity was a belief in health , but on the physical side , cleanliness being Next to"
No," is the first century home of the essenes , the Jewish sect , who rode Many of the Dead Sea Scrolls among the oldest biblical texts ever discovered found in these caves in 1947 . After being hidden for 2 000 years , the Dead Sea Scrolls revealed to us a prechristian"
No," their health and one of the things about the Scrolls besides religion and mysticism is ritual Purity bodily things , blood , sex , death and the toilets are precisely located outside the living area . At least 1500 cubits , that 's"
No," before reentering . The community washing is good for hygiene , but the essenes did n't know about sharing germs . That 'S bad ! For hygiene . You went outside the camp you 're coming back in"
No," They'Re going to get all in your eyes , your mouth , your nose , any Cuts they 're on your feet , and they would be unaware of this from a sanitation standpoint , everything 's unclean , I 'm a time bomb . Basically , I walk right into the community and spread yeah ."
No," privacy and perhaps more aware of infection . The Jewish people focused on spiritual health as the underlying basis for physical health . Jesus 'S healings were also connected with his teachings , but in a time when"
No," great miracles of healing were believed to have taken place , it was also a time when a simple cut on the hand could kill you , I 'm in Israel , learning all about what people . In the time of the Bible did when they got sick"
Environment," could kill you instead of a speeding car back , then it could just be a sharp tool right in the modern city of Nazareth . Is this Recreation of what it would have looked like when Jesus grew up here , I 'm with Biblical scholar , James Tabor , and we 're going to see how everyday"
No, as tetanus . How did people at the time deal with these unexplained deaths ? This is Mayor bar Allan who teaches Jewish history . I want to find out how common early death was in biblical times . Life expectancy was very low . I mean for men about 31 years of age and women
No," much more familiarity with that . The greater awareness of death and acceptance is that true , definitely because they saw death in a rates much higher than as modern people . For example , all women gave birth to , let 's say about six children , six kids about about"
No," , but until the age of 1820 . Let 'S not we survived , so infant mortality was 50 or more , which tells you that each and every person lost his children or lost his brother 's sister before Jesus could grow up to become the"
No, spot where the most famous birth in history took place . It 'S believed that Jesus was born here and to Mark the Spot . The Church of the Nativity was built . Many think the low door was made to force people to Bow their heads before
No," Some people turn to Magic , but since the population was Jewish , I need to find out how Jews viewed Magic . So I 'm asking Rabbi Ken Spiro : are there mitzvot about things like magic , because people on the margins I mean people in Desperate situations , tend"
No," belief in the power of the evil eye to bring harm . It was caused by the jealousy of others , and if you had n't , protected yourself from it now , you had to remove it through rituals such as the one Rabbi Fuchs is about to perform on me ."
No," , so they only hate me slightly . They jealous of you they 're jealous of me now , how do I , how do I ward off this evil eye , then this is what you do you 're gon na . Do it for me glad to see my evil eye melting away there ? That gives me some comfort ."
No," Well , that was close was the evil eye really removed from me , or is this just superstition in the time of the Bible , as today , there 's no shortage of beliefs around healing charismatic healers and people who seek them out , but not all"
Environment," any medical training , physiology or biology or anything so I 'd like to ask Oren , how does he diagnose and now I give you a lot of energy of the body appearance when you buy the subconsciousness ? I want you two minutes close your eyes . Okay , it was right"
No, foreign . Do you consider yourself to be a a miracle worker foreign and they do n't need explanations for their belief . You ca n't explain what it is and why I do n't want to know what it
No," is not just a place in a story . Archaeologists have now found the actual pool , and it 's right near where the Holy Temple stood in 2005 . The public works department of the city of Jerusalem was digging here"
No," So this is the police alarm . Welcome to the Gospel of John , the blind man was cured by Jesus . So what you have is Jesus . He comes to Jerusalem when he arrives in a temple era , he 's only one of many voices , many opinions , but the only place where he really has the audience is in"
Environment," think he he was a person who had an understanding of medical matters without the medical training . So was Jesus a first century doctor , let 's see if he fits the bill , I 'm going to ask archaeologist Gabby barkai We 've Come to an ancient place"
No," protection against harm and the verse from The Book of Numbers written on this fourinch scroll is the Priestly benediction , which Is still set in synagogues and churches today , it 's a blessing of God 's protection , a formula for health"
No," They believed in this time that they do not need the resurrection because they are alive , and that was something like sleep . So Gabby I 've been reading and hearing an awful lot about uh healing powers and medicine at the time of the Bible , and especially about Jesus and his"
No," healing powers . What do you think about all that in one of the texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls , we have a description of the Messiah as a Healer . So it was a popular belief at that time that if somebody is a messiah , he needs to be a Healer as well . They can cure you of everything he"
No," stuff which turned out to be human , hair and fragments of skull human urine at the back . Yes , but the question is : why was this person not Leon turd and put into an Australia or his bones , were collected with his other family members in biblical times after they left your"
No," corpse for a year or so so that your flesh could fall off ? You always received secondary burial in Jesus 's time . Your family came back and put you into bone boxes ossuaries , but the man Shimon found , did not get a secondary burial ."
No," Why did n't his family return for him ? Not only that , but you see that this is Plaster . You see the edges of the plaster all the way around , so the door uh was placed here at some point and uh . He had been almost locked away inside . So it 's a bit of a mystery here . Did you"
No," and there was no proof that any of them were leprosy , but Shimon Gibson 's . Finding here confirmed that in Jesus 's time , leprosy did exist when it came to death . However , the family members would have been afraid , so they just would have put him in and closed"
No," the door . Sealed him up and sat , and this probably put something on the outside said : do not open . You know , and that was that so not only does this tomb tell us that leprosy existed in the time of Jesus , it tells us about people 's fears . His family did n't even want to touch his"
No," bones after he died for fear of catching the disease . They seem to have known that diseases can be contagious , an idea that did n't catch on until 12 centuries later , the depending on the luck of the draw , some would say the will of God . Some diseases LED you to a dead end and no"
No," Overlook the value of more traditional healing methods , I 'm on my way to meet a man who may have some answers for that he does n't depend on magic , miracles or medicine , and he must be Doing something right because he 's 106 years old"
No," So your good health is because of your belief in God , foreign . I wanted to ask you about the the evil eye . Do you know a lot about this about these kind of symbols ? Number five ? What do you think about the"
No," the spiritual are connected , we 're searching for more than health when the blind man received his sight . Maybe what he received was insight today we have more scientific answers , but we still have medical questions and fears ."
Environment," Jerusalem to find out what life was like in the first century . There 'S plenty of security today , all over the city , but that 's nothing . New 2000 years ago , Temple guards and soldiers converged in Jerusalem 's Garden of Gethsemane to arrest Jesus setting in"
No," happens when two societies collide at the time the Roman Empire Was occupying Judea so in the first century , how did the Romans keep the peace among people who had totally different beliefs about Law and Order"
Environment," him out and leave as fast as we can . According to the gospel Jesus goes quietly across that Valley . He spent a long night awaiting his fate . The simmering tension of Roman occupation of the Jewish people had boiled over , but the imposition of Roman law affected"
No," Jews had problems with one another or if they had problems with their neighbor , then there was a Jewish court system . There was a Jewish legal system and the last thing in the world that they would do would be to turn to a Roman official and to suggest this from that Roman"
No," official . So it sounds like as long as things were n't - let 's say , political in orientation , that the Romans sort of Live and Let Live , and Let Jewish courts deal with Jewish issues the Romans when they interfered . Third , normally they asked you whether you were guilty or innocent and"
No," if you said innocent , they tortured you until you said guilty , and at that point they usually put you to death . The Romans really have a sophisticated understanding of Jewish legal systems . The Romans had almost no understanding of what Jewish life was and what Jewish"
No," , very different . This difference was the Torah , the first five books of the Bible which govern every aspect of Jewish life because of a law in the Torah that Jesus and his disciples are in Jerusalem . On that fateful night"
No," , it was a religious holiday Passover , a time when the Torah commands Jews to come to Jerusalem , Judaism , religion , everyday life and politics all overlap , because the Torah does n't differentiate between them . I 'M meeting with Rabbi Ken Spiro who 's"
No," showing me the Torah . Its contents have not changed in over 3 000 years . I want to find out how Jewish law works , so the the Torah squirrel is the law . Yes , it 's , it 's called the written law , so these are the Commandments the Commandments are in here all the 613"
No," were extremely important . The point of this law would be to discourage stealing the torah 's laws cover everything they cover . What Jews can eat and can not eat , there 's a commandment to rest on the Sabbath"
No," and it even tells them how to take eggs from a bird 's nest . First , you must shoe the mother away , so she wo n't have to see her children taken from her there 's . Even a law about writing the law . All torahs must be written by hand ."
No," to be some meat from a lamb sacrificed in the temple . The Romans must have found all this very strange , but as long as the taxes were paid , they allowed the life of the temple and its laws to continue . You can see the Western Wall , the temple"
No," that used to be on the other side of that wall was the most important place in the Jewish World before the Rome was destroyed it in the year 70 . But the temple was n't only the spiritual center of Jewish life . It was the place where the highest Jewish Court , the Sanhedrin"
Environment," ground level in the first century has been buried by two Millennia building , but excavations have revealed buildings that were near the temple and not destroyed . I want to find out what effect Roman occupation had on the powers of the"
No," and we can see that pressure playing out around the arrest of Jesus , the men arresting Jesus are the temple guards who report to the high priest and these Roman soldiers are watching to make sure the situation does n't get Out of hand , in the first century , conflicting laws put"
Environment," I 'M finding out how the Roman occupation of ancient Israel helped create the tensions which led to this arrest . It also led to conflicts for everyone else . Jesus was arrested at Passover , which celebrates Freedom From Slavery in Egypt , but under Roman occupation , Jews were"
Environment," slaves to taxation . Before the Romans came , Jews had taxation mandated by the Torah . The law of gleaning , for example , was a safety net for the poor to try to make sure no one went hungry . I 'M meeting Joseph gidler , who founded"
No," not far from here near Bethlehem . She gleaned in the fields of a man named Boaz . They fell in love , they had a child and about 40 Generations later was Jesus . Gleaning is a positive commandment , one of the thou shalts . I also want to find out about the Thou shalt Nots , so I 've"
No," the Commandment to keep the Sabbath may explain why Jesus was arrested on what scholars believe was a Thursday . He could n't be arrested the next day , because Jewish courts could not meet on the Sabbath which begins at sundown . On Friday"
No," , but what is the reason behind this day of rest ? The Sabbath is a biggie , because it 's one of the most fundamental principles in Judaism that God created the world and observing the Sabbath as a way that the Jewish people , individually and collectively throughout history , have"
No," Jews followed their laws and the Romans imposed theirs . Keeping a close eye on these people who took time off from work for their Sabbath to the Roman way of thinking . This could be trouble , giving the Jews too much time to think about who is now running their land . I want to"
No," that you want to symbolize God , God says I rest on a Saturday I did n't create on Saturday . Okay , be like me , do n't do work of creation so to do work to pick up a chair . I 'M allowed okay . So I ca n't draw a picture exactly okay and we know we 're going to"
No," , but they knew the Jews would not compromise on their sacred laws which had to be followed , but if they were n't followed , what were the punishments ? I 'M in Israel learning all about Law and Order and crime and punishment in the"
No," time of the Bible in this famous scene from the gospels , Jesus gets caught between two systems of Law and Order , the Jewish authorities and the Roman occupiers who eventually pass sentence under Jewish Law there was also capital"
No," punishment , but the Romans took away the right of the Jewish Court to carry it out . Many of the Jewish laws called for the penalty of flogging if they were broken , why this form of punishment ? We know that , after his arrest and before"
No," his crucifixion Jesus was flogged on the orders of the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate , so flogging was both a Roman and a Jewish punishment . But what were the differences ? I know I 'm gon na regret this , but I 'm on"
No," my way to experience a first century Jewish flogging today , prisons serve as both deterrent and punishment , but they were n't so common around here 2000 years ago . Punishments such as flogging Were Meant to keep people in line ."
No," I would be in Jerusalem being flogged in a synagogue by rabbis , never never occur so . First century Jewish flogging had remorse and repentance as its goal . It had certain Humane elements , but try telling that to my back , the doctor made sure you could take it"
No," the temple in Jerusalem , Jews could see where their tax money was going . King Herod was Jewish , but he was appointed by Rome over two thousand years ago . He built that wall Herod taxed the population heavily , but he balanced the interests of both"
No," , one of the fortresses built by King Herod and where he is buried , Herod built these fortresses because he knew the delicate balance between Jewish and Roman law would n't last and that Revolution would come"
No," , Rome was not only imposing its Law and Order on the local Jewish population . It also had problems with its own governors , who operated far away from the center of power to learn more I 'm meeting with Alex"
No," Jewish people were still being fleeced by local , Roman corruption , and I 've heard that when it came to punishment , the Romans were very creative . What other kind of punishments did the did ? The Romans impose , but crucifixion was the worst . Of course"
Environment," Roman law ? There was a range of reactions from acceptance to deadly Rebellion under Roman occupation of first century Israel . The way it was supposed to work was that internal Jewish law would deal with Jewish issues , and Rome would only"
No," intervene when there was a threat to Peace , Quiet , the collection of taxes , but it was n't so simple because of the Holy Temple that used to be behind That wall , the Western Wall , foreign , was responsible for maintaining order in"
No," the temple , but Rome exerted plenty of influence on him . The high priest 's cooperation with Rome led to gray areas of jurisdiction which affected both the daily life of the temple and the fate of Jesus , but whose law did Jesus Break"
No," some say he committed heresy , which , as religious law , was a Jewish matter . Some say it was Insurrection or sedition , which Rome considered its turf , but if Jesus called himself the Messiah , that was a gray area , was it religious or did it affect the"
No," peace , worried the priests who needed the Romans to leave the temple alone , so they could keep fulfilling their holy functions . So the high priest had a good reason to cooperate with his Roman occupiers . The Priestly class he belonged to was called"
No," the Sadducees . They were only one among many Jewish sects and I 'm going to find out about the others and their reactions to Roman Law and Order . Judaism and all with very different ideas of what it means to be Jewish , so you have um the Sadducees who are mainly"
No," linked to the temple they 're , the aristocratic priests . Then you have the Pharisees , and these are ones who are very keen to keep the law very . Strictly , though , debated some scholars believe Jesus himself was a Pharisee . Then there were the essenes ."
No," This Jewish sect believed in the coming of the kingdom of God , and they wrote about it here in qumran by the Dead Sea and what are some of the oldest documents ever found ? The Dead Sea Scrolls , I 'm with author and biblical expert"
No," James Tabor , to find out more about this Jewish sect and to see the actual place where they hid their Scrolls from the Romans you 've heard of Pharisees and Sadducees right in the Bible . The essenes are n't mentioned , but they 're a radical , apocalyptic group"
No," on things . Yeah . The gazelle goat comes to mind because it is really Rocky and it is dirty among the contents of the Dead Sea . Scrolls were passages from the Bible . The essenes who lived here in seclusion , believed their interpretation of Jewish law was the correct one to live , simply"
No," other Jewish sects , who would end up fighting this war in Greek , the disciple Simon zolotti 's . Last name means zealot . The zealots believe that God Alone is the ruler of Israel and that the Romans must be expelled . Some say Simon was a"
No," warning , then Blended back into the crowd . The gospels tell us that when Jesus is arrested , his disciple Peter pulls out a knife and cuts off the ear of one of the temple guards . We do n't know that Peter was a Sakari"
No," Romans culminated right here at the Holy Temple in Jerusalem , with the Jews barricaded inside and as they as these are locked and encased in in Jerusalem , with with the Romans outside the Romans come into Jerusalem , they burn"
No," down um the The outer parts of Jerusalem and the temple itself is burnt to the ground , and that was a terrible terrible moment for for Jews in the first century and and still for for Jews . It 'S a terrible thing that happened because there are"
No," all kinds of different ways of being Jewish in the first century , but the thing that holds everybody together is the Jewish law and the temple , and when the temple goes , nobody can understand it . You know how do you explain that ? How did God let the temple be destroyed ?"
No," These Stones were part of the temple wall destroyed by the Romans . So today you can still see the evidence of that biblical clash between two systems of Law and Order . According to the gospels , Jesus foresaw the destruction of the Temple ."
No," Passover ? And if you were an average citizen in those times , what message were you being given by the whole process ? Well , this is where it all happened . On Passover , Jewish Pilgrims from all"
No," over the Middle East and Beyond , would have come right here . They would have walked up these actual steps to the temple . So what was it really like in the first century here I 'm going to meet with Helen Bond and she 'll set the seat"
No," Jews from all over the place are converging in into what 's really quite a small City . It 'S a huge pilgrimage . People have journeyed long ways : they 've they 've come here with their families they 've given up work for a week two weeks , possibly even more , and there would have"
No," from bondage , but the difficulty is that here they are in Jerusalem and they just need to look up on top of the temple and they 'd see Roman soldiers stationed . There must have struck them as being a huge irony . One of the reasons why the governor comes to Jerusalem , specifically"
Environment," at the Passover , is because it 's such a security nightmare . The Jewish author Josephus says that nearly all the the riots that we know about happened at Passover really . So this is sort of a known time for riots rebellions , but the soldiers are vastly outnumbered"
No," was maintained , so the temple guards arrest Jesus and take him to the home of the high priest . Caiaphas , Shimon Gibson and I are now overlooking the valley Jesus crossed when he was taken from The Garden of Gethsemane ."
No," This church of Saint Peter was built next to a house dated to the first century and we 're heading there . Now so hey , we got ta Step Back 2 , 000 years to the first century and we 're going to enter into a house that exists at the time of Jesus and is in the general"
No," vicinity of the traditional House of Caiaphas step inside I 'll . Take off my hat out of respect , so this is the real deal I mean this is this : is a house from the time of Jesus Christ ? Exactly I mean here , you 're inside the internal Courtyard , you have this depression in"
No," acting or doing anything against a temple . Could have been seen as Blasphemous because it 's such a holy Place . Another couple of the gospels suggests that it was simply the charge of leading people astray or being a false prophet , and those are very broad"
Environment," received a pretty strong message about law order and the consequences of opposing Rome . Jesus is the one we 've heard about , but in the land of Israel under Roman occupation , thousands of Jews were crucified by the Empire which wanted to"
No," subdue the citizens into paying a punishing amount of tax . So what was daily life like for the Jews after the crucifixion of Jesus and the destruction of the Temple , hundreds of thousands had been either killed or enslaved , but there were still"
No," some members of the zealots and Sakari alive . They were living here at Masada . Herod had fortified this place to fight potential Rebels , but the Jewish Rebels defeated the small Roman Garrison stationed here . The Jews took over Masada , but in the"
No," year 73 the Romans returned with six thousand soldiers and set up camp to fight the 960 Jewish Rebels . The last ones left to defend the Jewish law , I 'm with guy steebel , who has excavated here at Masada"
No," battle occurred . It 'S a place where people lived because all communities - rich people , poor people - fled to Masada . So we have clusters of rooms . It 'S like you can see these different communities . I can identify areas where women , for example , set and leave . We found a bakery ."
No," So how did the 960 Jewish Rebels fight back ? They had The High Ground and could drop huge stones on the Romans . What you see is actually genuine Rolling Stones . I mean they 're , my favorite type of weapon . If you wish this was a Jewish answer for the Roman superiority using"
No," , but the Romans were building a ramp and a Siege Tower and constructing a battering ram to break down the wall that separated them from the Jewish zealots . It was four decades after the death of Jesus and the exact same time of year ."
Environment," have been a a frightening thing to see this giant Tower coming up this ramp two thousand years ago , when the eve of Passover , it was Nightmare , the noise , the smoke , the shouts , the crowd , The news at once they managed to bring these things up . They are doomed once the tower was up"
No," , they lived according to Jewish laws as long as they could . The last vestiges of Uprising were over . It was n't peace , but it was quiet when it came to Law and Order in first century Judea . On one side there was Roman power and , on the other , there were"
No," the Jews with their Traditions , their laws . One side never had a chance . That side turned out to be the Romans their empire , their power did not last , but the Jewish group whose leader was arrested in Gethsemane , ended up becoming"
No," the biggest religion in the world , with one of its spiritual centers in Rome . As for the rest of the Jewish people , their culture is still here , the temple had been destroyed , but it was n't the only Center of Jewish life , the Torah the law was"
Environment," 2022 . In windsor . We also offer training , and one of the reasons that we 're here today um , is to talk around the training that um we offer and one of our main training courses is trusted assassin . But we also deliver"
Environment," adaptations throughout warwickshire um . My career background is working very much in adaptations within social care . So today , as claire has already mentioned , we 're going to be looking at bathrooms and bathroom adaptations um"
No," just firstly to say is the bathing solution that we um , that we prescribe um , as i 'm sure we 're all aware , is not just based on uh want and customer preferences . So , just just to mention as well i 'll use"
No," We would expect bathing equipment to be trialled before this to obviously roll roll . That in all this out and a key factor here , is that we need to be satisfied that the client is able to transfer"
No, thinking about other family members that mean that may still need to use the bath and such as thinking about children in the property . So if somebody could use an overbought shower with equipment safely
No," and you 've got a child who , for their development , needs to be able to use the bathroom , that is also a consideration . Um and as some of you are probably aware within when we 're looking at dfg 's , we have to make sure that we do n't"
No," adversely impact on the family members in the property . Excuse me , so i will talk about shower cubicle and level access showers together , um , because there are obviously some similarities"
No," in the height , but what we have to think about here is the longterm deeds as well so um . We need to be satisfied that , if this is what we 're prescribing , then this will meet the foreseeable needs ."
No," drainage issues . Maybe in blocks of flats highrise towers and so on , so it may be a structural issue that actually means we need to do this , but again it has to meet the need so thinking about moving on to a level"
No," access shower . So , as you can see , it does n't have a step or a lip to enter the shower area and , generally speaking , people of all ages and mobility levels can enter the shell with relative ease um"
No," , either with a mobility aid or with mobility equipment such as a um . A wheeled shower chair , so thinking about what the indicators may be for a level access shower and we think about medical conditions and thinking"
No," weigh well whether from an energy conservation and a pacing point of view , if somebody could use one of the earlier options , i 've mentioned , but actually at least i 'm totally exhausted , and it means that they then could n't carry on with other activities of daily"
No," , because the effort of using bathing equipment or using a shower cubicle um is such that it leaves them exhausted . We do also need need to look at that and again it 's part of our clinical reasoning ."
No," I think that 's a really important thing thing to consider , because i think on in some situations we may actually think they can just about use bathing equipment . It 'S a bit of a struggle um , but actually that bit of a struggle"
No," clinical reasoning . We look at what the most suitable option is and we take into account . Uh customers needs uh , other people in the property and again thinking about how long this"
No," very effective . They do dry the whole of the body rather quickly and and again thinking about skin conditions . Um . It may be that um yeah again , if somebody has a particularly severe"
No," skin condition , um such as their eczema or psoriasis . Then a drying solution such as this may be an option . Okay , um next slide , please , okay , so just thinking about the size of the bathroom adaptation ."
No," chair in the shower , the larger size fifteen hundred by fifteen hundred would generally be considered when you 're looking at a larger tilt in space um shower chair , which Will come to a couple of slides down"
No," so um shower screens and door solutions , um , okay . So when we think about the shower screens , if we look , if we look at what 's on on the picture and when we 're looking at halfeyed shower screens , we 're predominantly thinking about"
Environment," flood out and obviously because of the obvious health and Safety issues , so the halfheight fixed , shower screens , give um safe access for care and support screens keep"
Environment," shower screen that you or i might have in our property , and we generally do not recommend them and simply because of the safety and the entrapment risk um it . It impedes the access the carers as well . So if you 're thinking"
No," about carer support and thinking about , if you picture that that third photo and if you picture somebody in there that needs carer support um , it would be very difficult and for somebody to"
No," ambulance people who are also going to be using the shower so that the seat can be popped up out of The way and and give access to other family members that are using the airbnb here , too um the drop down shower seats . Um you know , can be an option ."
No," so again . Thinking about people that may have sensory issues that actually do n't want to have the shower running down over their head and particularly , if you 're prescribing for a child"
No," assessment , but you need to think about the how the person is going to grip , that as needed and thinking about the height and the attachments that are required . If you have somebody that is particularly tall in height"
No," Okay ! Flooring ! Now again , generally speaking , when we think about wet rooms and level access , shower rooms and , generally speaking , you 'd be thinking about perhaps outro flooring"
No," , um and again thinking does somebody need a grab rail located near to it as well to enable them to use it ? But what what i would say with the shower unit is again : your contractors might have different"
No," shower unit . Again , thinking about highrise flats tower blocks and sometimes the water pressure can be an issue . Okay next slide , please : okay , other considerations , um"
No," small pieces of equipment that some of you may have seen before so we 're thinking about here about flood detectors , and so , if you know that somebody has a an issue where they may not um , be aware , if there 's a Flood or um"
No," they may be prone to behavioral issues , uh that may result in them , leaving the shower running so on and so on . So uh flood detectors are an option to consider um also thinking about . If somebody has a"
No," need for an alarm , pull such as the picture on the right , um again , not something that is commonly prescribed , but it 's just a consideration also when you 're thinking about a bath . If you are , if you are um uh , providing a"
No," bath thinking about a magic plug that will actually um uh release the water away , if the tap is left running again , you can find details of those um online uh , but they 're just options to"
Environment," consider . So thinking about the flood risk thinking about safety issues , okay next slide , please , okay ! So we 've spoken about quite a lot already about what you need to include in your"
No," Drainage and water pressures layouts hazards , thinking about people , maybe you have dementia or a visual impairment , uh structure , integrity of the of the actual room uh and if we 're having grab rails , is there a"
No," suitable wall to put them on heating like ventilation ? Do we have any damp issues uh do they need a dressing and vision , contrast thinking about the color of grab rails , the color of flooring"
No," seating , um , but type and location of rails . Again , thinking of contrast , whether you need a different color rail , but also where do you actually need them by the toilet , in the shower um , height position and"
No," thinking about you know is : is there a window that may need changing because um it is an open , a clear glass ? It may need to be changed for opaque glass . Okay and we 've considered the shower"
No," location of the tray . Okay , next slide , please ! Okay ! Now . Lastly , i 'm just going to touch on bathing . So now again , bathing can be um a little bit of a um . Quite a hot topic to discuss , and if and if we 've had"
No," consider that bathing in some situations may be a solution , particularly with with children . But what we have to consider is um is the impact of that . So again , what is the clinical need for a bath um"
No," and thinking of your clinical reasoning , with with the health condition ? Would it meet the needs long term or would it meet the needs for now , but actually , if the condition changed , they would n't be able to access"
No," the wet room where the where there is no lip um , but we do have to think about um , would they meet the needs long term and again , in some cases they may i say , particularly with children"
No," , do they need hoisted into the back or it 's sealing track , hoist . There 'S lots and lots of considerations um , generally speaking in my experience , um i 've considered baths for uh children 's cases um"
Environment," Are there any safety issues if you had somebody with a condition that um , that meant they experienced um seizures or um jerking movements of the body ? You know you particularly have to think about"
No," that when getting in and out of a bath , and particularly if we 're having a hoist situation like receive the picture , so there is much to consider within with with bathing . But again it 's not something that that"
Environment," This week in environmental science , we 'll be taking a look at chapter 10 , which is on environmental , health and toxicology . Our objectives for the chapter are to understand environmental , health and environmental hazards to understand toxic substances in the environment , the"
No," of plastic that soon found use in water bottles , food containers , eyeglass lenses , CDs , DVDs , laptops and Other electronics , out of parts and sports equipment , including baby bottles and children 's toys with so many uses , BPA , has become one of the world 's most produced"
No," chemicals . Each year we make about a half a kilogram of BPA per person on the planet . Unfortunately , BPA leeches out of its many products and into our food and water and our air and our bodies . So we can fully say that 93 % of Americans carry detectable concentrations of BPA"
No," countries have actually banned it , including Canada , where it 's banned altogether and Japan has banned it altogether . In some nations like the US , we restrict its use with babies and small children only so for the rest of us adults . We are in contact with BPA"
Environment," , probably on a daily basis because of the mounting safety concerns . There is some speck of good news , such as Campbell 's company has announced that it 's transitioning away from using BPA in their soup can liners and food giant 's , ConAgra and Nestle , and Heights have"
Environment," face four main types of environmental hazards : the first one is physical hazards . These occur naturally in our environment and can include things like UV radiation , earthquakes , volcanoes fires , floods linked , slides hurricanes and droughts . We ca n't prevent them , but we"
Environment," cholera . We ca n't avoid risk , but we can reduce infection through monitoring , sanitation and treatment and educating others . The fourth type of environmental hazard we face as cultural hazards , these result from where we live from our socioeconomic status , from our occupation"
No," other cultural hazards like diet , nutrition , criminal , behavior and workplace hazards . Environmental justice advocates argue that forced risks from cultural hazards , like the living near a hazardous waste site , are often higher for people with fewer economic resources"
No," global warming is enabling tropical diseases like malaria , dengue and cholera to gain footholds in our temperate regions in our world of global mobility and dense human populations . Novel infectious diseases or new strains of old diseases that emerge in one location"
Environment," , sanitation , access to clean food and water security and by education . Toxicology is the study of chemical hazards . Our modern society is exposing us to more and more synthetic chemicals . As we begin to make more and more of these in industrialized nations , some of"
Environment," ourselves to enough of it . So quantity always plays a role as more and more people are concerned with exposing ourselves and the environment to toxicants . The field of environmental toxicology has grown , interviewed deals specifically with toxic substances that"
Environment," come from , or a discharged into the environment . Toxicologist generally focus on human health and use other organisms as models and test subjects such as mice on plants . Most environmental health hazards actually exist indoors . Most Americans spend 90 % of their time"
No," indoors . Cigarette smoke and radon , which can occur indoors , causes lung cancer . Mold can occur indoors in homes and in offices and produces toxic compounds that can have negative effects on human health . Asbestos , which is used for insulation"
Environment," , can cause problem if inhaled , LED pipes and gasoline damages organs and causes learning problems , hearing loss and death , education and phaseout has decreased lead poisoning . One recently recognized indoor hazard is polybrominated diphenyl"
No, animal testing suggests that they can also cause cancer and affect thyroid hormones and have a negative effect on brain and nervous system . Development concern about them rose in the 1970s to 1997 when they found that concentrations of these compounds and the breast milk
No," of Swedish mothers rose exponentially . So the European Union banned them in 2003 , and concentrations in breast milk has declined since , but yet the United States has yet to make any decisions on banning this chemical risks must be balanced against rewards . We have to remember mint"
Environment," known to grow and love as humans . So we need to remember the benefits and then weigh the negative side effects and search for better alternatives . Our environment contains countless natural substances that can pose health risks , including things like oil , losing"
No," substances for every man , woman and child . Many of these are particularly pesticides and insecticides . These find our way into our soil , air and water and into humans and other organisms . In fact , US government 's latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey"
Environment," very few have been thoroughly tested for the vast majority . We simply do n't know what effects if any they may have on us . Synthetic chemicals travel through the environment in many ways , as we can see in this chart home from work from medical facilities in public spaces"
Environment," , but definitely the endangerment of our national bird Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring was a bestseller and generated social change in Views and actions towards the environment , it helped cause the banning of DDT in the US and 1973 , but developing countries with tropical"
Environment," climates still use it to control mosquitoes , because mosquitoes are the vector that carry the parasite that causes malaria . Many toxicologists focus on synthetic chemicals , but we need to remember that toxic substances also exists naturally , so do n't assume that"
No," long time in between the exposure and the onset of cancer . The link between cigarette smoke and cancer is an example , mutagens cause DNA mutations . They can cause cancer and can harm sperm and egg cells , teratogen x ' cause birth defects and embryos . One example is a drug that"
No," was used in the 1950s called thalidomide . It was taken by pregnant women to prevent nausea and as a sleeping pill . Unfortunately , the drug turned out to be a terrible tragedy and cause birth . Defects in the babies that were born to the women who had taken the drug and the"
No," birth defects included the Mis development of their limbs . The drug was banned in the 1960s , then neurotoxins affect the nervous system like lad and Mercury , which can build up in our systems , allergens over activate the immune system . One hypothesis for the"
Environment," increase of asthma in recent years is that allergenic synthetic chemicals are more prevalent in our environment today . Allergens are not universally considered toxicants , however , because they affect some people , but not others . Pathway inhibitors interrupt biochemical"
No," make energy . Most recently , scientists have recognized endocrine disruptors as toxicants , and it can endocrine disruptors affect the endocrine system , which is our system of hormones that stimulate growth and development and sexual maturity . They"
No," widely in children 's toys . Perfumes , cosmetics and many other items . Health research on phthalates has linked them to birth defects . Breast cancer and reduce sperm counts . Just like BPA phthalate show how a substance can actually be allinone a carcinogen . A"
Environment," mutagen and an endocrine disruptor organisms have natural defenses . Although synthetic toxicants are new organisms have long been exposed to natural toxicants like mercury , cadmium , arsenic and other harmful substances that are found naturally in the environment ."
No," the response . People in poor health will be more sensitive to synthetic and natural , harmful chemicals . Sensitivity also varies with sex age and weight . Fetuses infants and young children can be more sensitive . The US Environmental Protection Agency or EPA sets standards"
No," , lung cancer and liver damage from alcohol abuse so cause and effect may not be easily apparent toxic substances and their effects on ecosystems when toxicants harm individuals , populations become smaller and the decline affects other species , then"
No," because of food webs and food chains . If predator species are affected and the prey species can experience a population growth , if the prey species are affected , then we see in decline in predators as they 've lost their food sources . Cascading impacts change , the communities"
Environment, actual site of use and synthetic chemicals are found globally in Arctic polar bears and an Arctic Antarctic penguins and people in Greenland . We find chemicals within them . Pesticide drift is the airborne transport of pesticides . Toxic substances can concentrate in
No," water , runoff concentrates contaminants in surface water , wastewater treatment , plants release toxins , pharmaceuticals and these toxification products from humans that can contaminate drinking water . Watersoluble chemicals can enter organisms through drinking or absorption"
Environment," such as in fish and frogs , and in stream . Invertebrates can serve as an indicator of pollution because it affects them . First , contaminants and streams and rivers enter drinking water and the air and the toxic intoxicants can move long distances through aquatic systems . Toxins"
No, the fatty areas and in the cell membranes they can transfer toxins to others through the food chain . Biomagnification is when the toxicant concentrations are magnified through trophic levels and have resulted in near extinction of organisms like the
Environment," peregrine falcon and involve Eagles toxic substances can change the composition of ecosystems . They affect how organisms interact with each other and the environment and can threaten ecosystem services . Pesticides , for instance , have killed many bees , though"
No, used because they elicit a listen few fewer ethical objections . The standard method of testing with lab animals and toxicology is called the dose response . Analysis scientists quantify the toxicity of a substance by measuring the strength of its effects or
No," effects at any concentration , but for others , responses can only occur at a certain dose or what 's called a threshold dose . The shape of dose response curves is important because estimating the effects on humans then often requires extrapolation , extending"
No," poison these unconventional dose response . Curves often occur with endocrine disrupters , like this phenol a it 's likely , because the hormone system is geared to respond to such my new concentrations of substances . Of course , it 's hard to determine the"
Environment," presenting challenges for scientists studying toxic substances and for policy makers trying to set safety standards for them , because so many novel synthetic chemicals and exist at so many very low concentrations over wide areas . Many scientists suspect that we may have"
No," underestimated the dangers of compounds that exert impacts at low concentrations . Scientists first noted endocrine disrupting effects decades ago , but the idea that synthetic chemicals might be altering the hormones of animals was not widely appreciated until the 1996 book"
No," others argue that the sharp rise in breast cancer rates , which is one in eight us women today , may be due to hormone Disruption because excess estrogen appears to feed tumor development and older women . Still other scientists attribute male reproductive"
No," scientific uncertainty and the youngness of the field , but because of the economic value of the chemicals being tested , for instance , tyrone Hayes 's work has met with a lot of criticism from the scientists associated with at resines manufacturer , because they would lose"
Environment," Many millions of dollars , if it 's widely used herbicide where did become banned or restricted , and now we return to the science behind the story with taste , testing the safety of bisphenol A or BPA dr hunt . At Case Western Reserve University in Ohio"
No," ; rather , it causes some probability of harm , a statistical chance that damage will result to understand a health threat . A scientist must know more than just its identity and strength . He or she must also know the chance that one will encounter it , the frequency with which"
No," , plane travel is actually much safer . We feel more at risk when we do n't control a situation , so we fear nuclear power and toxic waste , but not smoking or overeating . Though these voluntary activities are actually shown to pose far greater health risks , risk assessment"
No," individuals or the populations likely extent of exposure to the substance , including frequency of contact concentrations likely encountered and the length of the encounter accurate risk assessment is an important step toward effective risk management . It"
No," consists of decisions and strategies to minimize risk . Federal agencies have helped us to manage risk . For instance , the US has the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , or the CDC , the EPA or Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA or Food and Drug"
No," Administration 's scientific assessments are considered with economic , social and political needs and values in risk management . Comparing costs and benefits can be hard benefits . Are economic and easy to calculate the health risks or the costs are hard to measure and"
Environment," the safety of new products . For instance , the innocent until proven guilty approach can be employed . It assumes a substance is harmless until it 's shown to be harmful , it promotes technological innovation and economic activity . What allows dangerous substances to be used ?"
No," innocent until proven guilty approach in the us . Several federal agencies are assigned responsibility for tracking and regulating synthetic chemicals under various legislative acts , the FDA or Food and Drug Administration under an act first passed in 1938 monitors foods and"
Environment," food additives , cosmetics , drugs and medical devices . The EPA or Environmental Protection Agency regulates pesticides . Under a 1947 Act and it 's amendments , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or OSHA regulates work place hazards under a 1970 Act . Several"
Environment," and some types of food undergo testing for safety prior to release , but other potentially dangerous products like endocrine disrupting chemicals and plastics are not similarly tested . We'Ve seen that the US government 's approach to regulation relies more heavily on the"
Environment, for safety from the government to the industry . It requires that certain chemical substances produced or imported in amounts of over one metric ton per year be registered with a new European chemicals agency . The world 's nations
Environment," have also sought to address chemical pollution with international treaties , the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollution pollutants or pops pops4 since 2004 , and has been ratified by over 150 nation Pop 's P , Oh PS"
Environment," , the environment . They can bioaccumulate and bio magnify up the food chain and can travel long distances . Pcbs and other contaminants found in polar bears are a prime example of these pops , because these often cross international boundaries , an international treaty"
No," Your help in crowdsourcing the topics helped ensure these were both timely and interesting to the community. And your engagement in social media, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram has really helped expand knowledge to the public. So I invite you to join our conversation tonight on Twitter"
No," with #HMSMiniMed. I hope you'll join us for our last MiniMed School Longwood Seminar on April 22nd. It's the new old age. And we will learn all about how our body ages, and importantly we'll learn how to keep it young. Certificates of completion are available next week"
Environment," Their effect on wildlife, our environment, and on human health began to be questioned for the first time. We've learned a great deal over the past 55 years about the interconnection of nature and human health, yet thousands of everyday products are made with chemicals. Clothing, cosmetics, toys, food containers to name just a few."
Environment," and the director of the Harvard Education and Research Center at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. He is also a physician in the Division of Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Doctor Christiani has examined genetic factors that make people susceptible to lung cancer. At Mass General, he also researches"
Environment," Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you all, good evening. It's wonderful to see the big turnout we have tonight. I'm going to use environmental cancer as an example of environmental conditions that are preventable, either caused by the environment"
Environment," or to the extent that we know, environment contributes to their causes, which is a problem. But it's also the situation where there's the opportunity for prevention. And so the title is Preventing Environmental Causes of Cancer. There are only a few slides that are technical, and I'm going to reduce them very quickly"
Environment," Report that had implications for a global cancer health. The report was focused on chemicals in cancer. And then talk a little bit about the challenges that we face in the 21st century. So what are the landmarks in our understanding about how environment causes cancer in human beings? In the 19th century, cancer was somewhat unusual"
No," because people didn't live that long. And when it occurred, it was generally considered incurable. 20th century, fast forward to about mid part of the 20th century, much of human epidemiology, particularly in Europe and North America, shifted from the study of infectious diseases, flu, pneumonia, diarrhea, to chronic disease, ie now cancer."
No," And then after World War II, cardiovascular disease. So you can see this epidemiologic shift in what causes morbidity and mortality in countries across the world as we move from infectious causes of death and perinatal and childhood respiratory infection and diarrhea to chronic disease. Well, cancer is one of those chronic diseases."
No," So exposures to tobacco, diet, and some environmental chemicals so that was about the time when researchers first entertained the possibility that cancer can be prevented because we understand the cause. You can't prevent something you don't understand the cause of. So the late 20th century, early 21st century where we are now,"
No," and the green areas for the same cancers are low. So in the case of cervical and stomach cancer, it's very high in certain parts of the world where there's not refrigeration. Lung cancer is very high in the developed countries or industrialized countries of the world, and those undergoing rapid development like China."
Environment," So any kind of color map you use of cancer incidence varies a lot according to exposures and the economic status of the country which helps determine those exposures. Breast and prostate cancer, for example, are much more common in people in the industrialized world. And then if you look here in the US,"
No," the number one cause of cancer deaths in both men and women remains lung cancer. It's starting to trend downward because of smoking cessation efforts that started as early as 1964 when you see there was still a steep rise, but real serious attempts to restrict smoking that came into place in the '70s and '80s"
No," from when an exposure is introduced into the population. So for cigarette smoking in the Britain, Great Britain, 20 years after World War I you see this peak. US, it was around World War II where there's a big bump in cigarette smoking and when women started to smoke more. And then you see 20 years later."
No," Well, it happens with the other side too. When you start to see preventive efforts be put into place, it takes a while for the incidence to turn around and start to come down, which is what you see there. This is women where unfortunately lung cancer kills more women every year than the combination of breast, ovary,"
No," and colon. And so it's still and will be the number one killer for a long time in both genders in the US. Now I also want to touch on environmental cancer. So the reason I talk about smoking, by the way, is there was a strong environmental causes of cancer, of lung cancer."
No," We know what the cause is even without teasing out all the chemicals in lung cancer, and I'll come back to that in a minute. But you know that stopping or cessation efforts leads to a decrease in incidence. So we're able to, by identifying and intervening, make a difference."
No," Now childhood cancer, there's been a lot of debate about whether childhood cancer is increasing in the US. It's the second commonest cause of death of children in the industrialized world. And about 10,000 to 11,000 kids are diagnosed in cancer probably pretty much every year, and almost 1,600 will die. So just look at the line."
Environment," If you look at the surveillance data on children with cancer and do all the different statistical adjustments over the decades of '75 to 2008, there has been a gradual increase in US mortality for all childhood cancers under the age of 20. We don't know why. We suspect environment probably plays a role."
Environment," This is just a pie chart of the kinds of cancers that children get. By far leukemia and brain or central nervous system tumors lead the pack with a variety of very rare, much rarer ones in there. So what causes cancer? Why do we focus on the environment?"
Environment," world. But there are many others. High exposures tended to occur in workplaces because of the handling of the material, less so in the general environment. But you can have exposures to cancer causing agents in water, soil, such as contamination"
No," with arsenic or other carcinogens. Then of course there are lifestyle exposures. They're just as environmental, but they involve personal choice, whereas workplace would be an involuntary exposure or in the general community. Tobacco use, diet, physical inactivity, and in the case of viruses, sexual activity"
No," Medical treatments not to be underestimated these days. Chemotherapy, which cures a lot of people every year, but the agents themselves are carcinogens and they put treated people at risk for second tumors. Radiation, immune suppressing drugs all can be external causes of cancer. Now there are also some internal factors that are not"
No," It's in diesel exhaust. It's an oil emissions and coal emissions, and they're called polycyclics or PAHs. And we now know that those are a very active bunch of compounds to not single one that cause cancers, and not just lung cancer, not just skin or scrotal cancer, but also bladder and gut cancer."
Environment," And they're in our everyday environment, not just in the chimneys of London or in the workplaces where coal and oil is burned. So urban air pollution is loaded. Wherever combustion takes place is basically polycyclics released. There's a steel plant in China that's obviously"
No," And this tobacco smoke carcinogens themselves are a mixed group, and can cause a series of reactions that can lead to damage to DNA, and then mutation, and then cancers like lung or bladder cancer. We looked at this in a group of patients at Mass General as to why young people who start smoking"
No," at a younger age are at higher risk of getting cancer later in life than old people who started at older age, and found that there are more of these PAH bound to DNA in individuals' lung tissue if they started smoking at a younger age than if they started smoking at an older age. So it looks like it's permanent damage in the lung tissue"
Environment," line that circulating blood was a pretty good substitute, because we can't get lung tissue on people in population studies, was a pretty good substitute for lung in measuring these things. So urban industrial air pollution, mainly of air but also of water, are rich in these kinds of compounds."
No," We also, as another example, took a very different tact, looked at leukemia in children in Taiwan. Again, it's a busy slide, but I'm just going to point to this line right here where we looked at children with leukemia. Their risk of having childhood leukemia was about 54% higher if they lived within 1 kilometer of a petrochemical"
No," And each panel is done by topic, and there are several experts who then go around the country, interview experts, and talk to people in the field and talk to community members about what concerns them about cancer. And they did a couple of reports. One was on lifestyle factors associated with cancer, such as tobacco, and the other was diet,"
Environment," versus environmental risk come up. It's impossible to quantify these things. They're both very important. So that some 45% percent of cancer in the West is felt to be due to either smoking, diet, or lack of exercise. But that leaves the other 55% that we need to grapple with."
Environment," How much of that is environment is still up for grabs, except we know that probably 7% to 19% percent of that 55% is due to environmental exposures. The thing to be careful with all these percentages is sometimes they interact. You can have a lifestyle factor and an environmental factor adding up to problem, bigger problem,"
Environment," such as asbestos like in this picture. And asbestos and smoking together, rather than simply add risk to 15, multiplies the risk to greater than 50. So we have to do a lot to adjust our environments to minimize exposures to potential carcinogens. And some colleagues have raised the concept of the exposome."
Environment," and deaths each year now occur in low to moderate income countries. It's no longer just a disease of industrialized nations. As infectious disease comes under control, you see more chronic illness like cancer and cardiovascular disease causing mortality in the world. And the spread of the socalled Western lifestyle"
No," that industrial chemicals are still an important part of cancer in much of the world, and we need to control cancer by controlling these as well as controlling those caused by tobacco, alcohol, diet, inactivity. They should be complementary strategies. Finally, geneenvironment interactions."
No," A lot of questions about genetic susceptibility. Some tumors are due to very rare mutations that are inherited, making some people more or less susceptible to cancer. If they're very rare, sometimes it makes people very susceptible. But most of the genetics we study,"
Environment," they make someone susceptible only if they're exposed. If we remove the exposure, the genetic variant by itself is not harmful. Those are socalled common variants rather than rare mutations. So the contributions of environment to cancer remains underestimated."
No," We know it's a problem. It's a bigger problem in the rapidly industrialized countries of the world, and it spanned the gamut of traditional exposures we've known a lot about combined with new chemical exposures. And the contributions of mixed exposures to cancer in both work and community"
No," to what they can control, smoking, diet, plastic containers, et cetera. So thank you. I will end there. So now it's my to introduce Doctor Monica Colaiacovo. Doctor Colaiacovo is a professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School."
Environment," of how everyday chemicals affect DNA that illustrates the cost of an increasingly artificial environment and to equip the world with accurate information to enhance public awareness. Doctor Colaiacovo is an associate editor in several key journals of the world such as Genetics, Plus Genetics, and she's a recipient of a number of prizes"
Environment," And thanks to David for the introduction. So as you probably already had a feeling for in this introduction, there are various different chemicals in our environment. We're only starting to understand how they can impact health. And they can have various different kinds"
No," as a result of those exposures. And what I hope you can get a hint of from this title is that because the basis for reproduction, the formation of these reproductive cells, egg and sperm, are happening at a moment in time where it's ethically and technically impossible to look at this directly in humans,"
No," And so on the next couple of slides, I will introduce you to how serious this problem can be. If you look at the leading causes of infant deaths in the United States, exemplified here as the data for 2011 and 2012, what I hope you can appreciate is that the leading cause at the top"
Environment," program. And then a few years ago we realized we live also in a very complex environment. There are over 84,000 compounds that have already been produced. At least 1,000 additional compounds are added into the environment every year."
No, zipped up as well by a scaffold that holds these chromosomes together. That zipper goes away. But now the chromosomes remain attached because of the swapping of that genetic information that took place. And now they're under tension.
No," So the question, and I hope you can appreciate from this simple cartoon, is this is not a trivial process. There are many different steps that can go wrong. And what we wanted to ask is where can environmental exposures be affecting any of these steps during meiosis. The model organism that we use in the laboratory"
No," is this worm that I'm showing you here. When it's fully grown, it's about only one millimeter in length. And it offers a series of advantages for those of us who want to look at what happens in the germline. The first one I hope you can appreciate from this movie which is that it is a transparent organism."
No," of all the genes in the worm are also present in humans. And what I hope you can appreciate from this cartoon is that 50 percent of all the cells in the worm are contained in this structure that I highlighted in blue, which is the germline. So for those of us want to look at what happens in meiosis, 50% of everything in this worm is undergoing the process"
No, and they're moving. And what I hope you can see is everything that's in white here represent chromosomes in these nuclei. And here I'm showing you higher magnifications. You see a time course of progression. You can see changes as you proceed through the process of meiosis.
Environment," that's in the environment. And our compound of choice was bisphenol A, or BPA, which many of you must have heard a lot of. It's highly prevalent in the environment. It's a very commonly used plasticizer. Is in the inner lining of cans because it protects the product in the can from basically damaging the metal"
No," So can we identify the meiotic stages and processes that are affected as well as the genes and the pathways that are altered? Where is this bisphenol A going to be working in this germline? And I'm going to just really succinctly elaborate on some of the key findings, which is that at a very high concentration of exposure, one"
No," as it does in the control, chromosomes never fully progressed. They didn't quite align properly. But more importantly, and I hope you can see it indicated by the yellow arrow, we started to see these bridges, these connections that had never been resolved between the chromosomes."
No," So we then decided, well, we can use this strategy in a slightly different way. What if we now use that same reporter construct and expose our worms to chemicals? We can do this with multiwell plates, so we have various different chemicals, various different concentrations."
No," the cuticle barrier of the worm so that we can really now introduce very, very low concentrations of the chemicals. For example bisphenol A, we can significantly dial down the concentration. It's no longer 1 millimolar. It's 100 micromolars."
Environment," various different pesticides and antimicrobials, phthalates, which are highly prevalent in the environment because of plastics, cosmetics, what you spray on crops, shower curtains, and it's been working very successfully. We've been able to identify which of these are causing problems in reproductive health, and now we're"
No," starting to investigate why they're causing such problems, because that's the final step. We want to understand the pathway, the mechanism by which they're affecting this. And ultimately we want to find out chemicals that might exhibit transgenerational effects. So a single exposure of mom that can lead to"
No," effects not only in the children and the grandchildren, but in the great grandchildren as well. So with that, if there's one important take home message that I want to leave you with, it's that we can start to understand very important steps of this complex biological program by taking advantage of basic model organisms."
Environment," But we hope that this is one element in a cascade of things that might be used in assessing what chemicals might be doing before they're delivered into the environment. And with that, I'll thank the lab as well as funding sources. Thank you. Thank you Monica. Last speaker before questions is Doctor Maitreyi Mazumdar."
No," All right, is it better now? OK. So I'm a pediatric neurologist, and I've come to talk to you about children, children and environmental chemicals. And I'll just give you a quick overview about what I'm going to cover."
Environment," We'll spend a little bit of time talking about why kids might be more vulnerable to environment environmental chemicals. I'll use lead poisoning as a paradigm to discuss developmental neurotoxicity. Lead poisoning is in the news these days. And I think in addition to being a timely topic,"
Environment," provides windows where they may be more susceptible to harmful chemicals in the environment. They live longer, so they have a longer chance to develop problems even from an exposure early in life, and we'll talk a little bit about that. But I think most importantly, they rely on us, they rely on adults to protect them."
Environment," They can't make a lot of the choices about where they live, or their lifestyle, or what they eat, or what they're exposed to, or what's regulated in their environment. They don't vote. And so they are vulnerable just because of there situation or their position in our society."
Environment," So let's talk a little bit about different and unique exposures. So in addition to breathing the air and eating food and drinking the water, children are exposed to unique exposure pathways. They get chemicals passed through them through the placenta, through the umbilical cord, which can be a very protective environment."
Environment," The placenta often does shield out a lot of chemicals, but it's not perfect. They are exposed to chemicals through breastfeeding, which is just a very different way of getting exposure to a chemical in the environment. They have exploratory behaviors that are different from adults. They put things in their mounts."
Environment," A train toy that we might have on our desk, my son puts in his mouth. What can you do about that? So they are different. They have different stature and micro environments. They're shorter and closer to the ground, so they're closer to the carpets that might have chemicals."
No," If you say don't go over, there it's dangerous, that will be the first place that they go. So children are different. And you have to think about them differently when you're designing strategies to protect children. So some of these I've already talked about, their breathing zones."
No," Children are different within themselves. A crawling child might be more at risk than a child that can be put in a crib unless the crib itself is dangerous. Like I said before there, they're closer to the carpet. They also breathe more air per surface area. For their weight, for their built, they're taking in more."
No," They have a higher intake of food for their weight, and they eat different things. So they have a different diet. They have milk maybe more. They may have different types of things that are in their diet. I'm a pediatric neurologist, so when I talk about children, I talk about children's brains."
Environment," in the environment. So just to walk through them a little bit, proliferation is the first step. The cells in the brain have to multiply in number. Then the cells, once they multiply, they have to travel to where they're going. So that's a really exciting part of brain development"
Environment," of brain development. It's called pruning. Within that there is a very sophisticated formation of transmitters and receptors. And all of these things can be influenced by substances in the environment, by experiences in the environment as well."
No," So children develop on a very predictable course and in sequence. And so this is a slide from Chuck Nelson's group, who's at Boston Children's, showing that within the first year of life there are developments of vision and hearing pathways, followed by language, followed then by higher cognitive function."
No," And these are their brains or cartoon of their brains in cross section. And if you look at the adults who are here, children who were born after the poisoning incidents, and the brains of children who were in utero, whose mothers were pregnant at the time of this poisoning, they were all exposed to through drinking of water,"
No," or while they were in utero, the damage was much more widespread. So just the age and the developmental stage that these individuals were at at the time of exposure affected how they responded to this exposure. So that's an overview of developmental windows of toxicity, or why I think children"
Environment," may be more susceptible. And now let's talk about lead. And once again, there are many chemicals in the environment that we could talk about, but lead is really the paradigm and also it's very timely. So right now because of the situation in Flint, Michigan, we're learning a lot about lead in the water and lead"
No," in water pipes. But it's important to remember that LED is really everywhere in the United States. And there are multiple sources of exposure for children, even though it's improved substantially over the past decades. So in Flint, as many of you know,"
No," lead in the air from gasoline admissions was really the major source. And elevated blood levels affect the brain, and we'll talk about that to some extent, but it really affects every part of the body. At high levels, so levels at about 100 or 150 micrograms per deciliter, children"
No," used to die from lead exposure, and still do in many parts of the world, such as Nigeria where children are exposed to lead in lead mines. We'll talk a little bit about developmental toxicity and the studies that were done here in Boston where lead was shown to be associated with decreased IQ, decreased hearing, decreased growth,"
No," and other maybe less dramatic but still substantial neurologic outcomes. Actually, even though we're talking about lead, the story of lead is really one of our biggest public health successes. Blood lead concentrations in the US have reduced dramatically over the past decades."
No," In the 1970s and 1980s, the median blood concentration among children, median lead blood concentration was around 15, which is a level that would be considered completely unacceptable by today's standards. And now it's less than 2. And this has to do with restrictions"
No," done to look at the effects of childhood lead exposure showed that if you looked at the teeth of children who were exposed to lead, if you looked at children who had high levels of lead in their teeth by some measure, and those that have low, the IQ, the verbal IQ scores of the group with lower lead levels were higher. So there was a drop in IQ scores among children"
No," who had higher levels of lead in their teeth, teeth being a measure of chronic exposure. The number of IQ points wasn't very high. That change was around 4 IQ points, which may not seem like a big change. But if you look over a population over a big period of time, these children who were exposed to lead consistently"
No," both of IQ and of blood level. But when you sort of combine the data and look at them together, you can see that there's a pattern that at lower blood level concentrations, there's a steep drop in IQ with this being sort of a range of IQ. And as you go out, the shape of this curve flattens out. So there's certainly effects of lead"
No," of neurologic function, we don't even call it a threshold anymore. We say it's a reference level, that there's no level of lead that's OK. And this level of 5, which is the level that was used in Flint to identify children with high levels, is still something that we're trying"
No," to get lower and lower and lower every year. So those are the effects on children. But are there effects that last longer? How long do these effects last? So there's certainly a hypothesis that's out there that children who were exposed to lead, or exposure to chemicals early in life,"
No," has not only effects on the number of cells, or you can use this as cognitive function of a number of different outcomes on this yaxis. Not only do people who are exposed to this chemical exposure early in life, so this is let's say prenatally, and then this is their lifespan. This would be normal development."
No, There's some cognitive function and then some normal decline. I've taken the ages off here because I'm reaching the point of inflection. I don't really want to acknowledge that. But let's say you're exposed here and then there is a measurable change in your performance on tests because of your exposure
No," By the time it comes the time to evaluate them, they're 70 and I'm 100. So you can't really do very much about that. So we went back to our cohorts of children who were born in the '70s and '80s, and then we tried to see what they were doing. And I'll run through this quickly."
No," with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, we found that let's just use this one that those who had higher cord blood lead concentration had lower amounts, at least nothing in this area of these particular proteins. So it's an interesting hypothesis. It's one of many, but it's there."
Environment," So what we think we know I'll just end now. We know a lot about lead, but we really don't know much about these other chemicals. And there are many chemicals in the environment. Lead is a paradigm because of its effects on the brain, because we have a lot of literature about it. But there still are these other things"
No," that we can use a similar approach to study. And as David mentioned, we should apply a precautionary principal, and not wait to demonstrate that these things cause harm or to see that they cause harm, but especially in the case of children, err on the side of caution. So our conclusion is that children have heightened"
Environment," disease, and that we should apply a precautionary principal for the introduction of chemicals into the environment. And that's it. Thank you, Maitreyi. We're going to give people about 30 seconds to clear the room, and then we'll start with questions. Thank you for your questions."
No," One is, since human oocytes are generated early in development, at what period do exposures have their main effects? And for example, does a mother exposed to BPA have risk of offspring with aneuploidy, or do her children? So the process of meiosis is happening inside that developing fetus. So if the mother gets exposed, what's happening"
No," is you're affecting the meiosis that's taking place inside that baby. So ultimately, what you're doing is you're affecting the quality, for example, of the eggs that that child will eventually produce. The impact is going to be on the grandchild. So that child might have a higher incidence of aneuploidy"
No," because it got exposed while it was in utero. Having said that, meiosis is a process that takes decades. It's initiated in that developing fetus. It's then arrested. And then later as the child reaches puberty, that's when you start to complete meiosis. So you're in what's called diapause."
No," Another cancer question. You mentioned a lot of carcinogenic substances. Which single one should be targeted first? The obvious smoking. Well, actually it's a good question. You can go on to the EPA website, Environmental Protection Agency website and look"
No," And so I think the list is longer than you'd expect, beyond just things like smoking and a few others I mentioned. But most of them are not necessarily in everyday use. That's why the EPA site explains it a little better. Another question. Let's get a lead question for Maitreyi there. We dealt with microwaving."
Environment," Water safety. Is it safe to drink tap water in the US? Is filtered tap water better than unfiltered? What about boiled tap water? Boiled. Boiling it like they do in much of the world. Well, certainly tap water is in the news."
No," And I think I might need help with this from David. I think it depends on the region where you are. And I think this is an example of how different areas and different municipalities handle things differently. So I think in many communities, the water that comes from the pipes and tap water is probably very safe"
No," It's regional, but it's also very local. And so it is worth thinking about looking at your locale, what's been known about it and what testing you may have to do. Finally, boiling water is done in a lot of the world to avoid infectious contaminants. We never really recommend that."
Environment," Yes, but it's declined a lot because of regulatory and educational efforts. Secondhand smoke, a spouse living with a smoking spouse has about a 30% increased risk of getting lung cancer. So your spouse is the number one target. But in terms of the workplace and the general environment, there has been in the US I think significant, really"
No," So I don't know about lead in chocolate. I think the issue about lead in food products, however, is certainly one to talk about. In the US, food and food products, at least when it comes to metals, are quite well regulated, or at least that's my opinion. In the rest of the world and the rest of the developing"
No," not very long ago where the US had recalled batches of turmeric that had been shipped to the United States because their own testing so they do testing fairly regularly of imports had shown very high levels of lead in these food products. And in the sites where we work in Bangladesh, we found that we had high levels of lead among the children."
No," be in the ground or the soil. So whereas I don't think it's a big issue in the United States, I think contamination by metals and other chemicals in the food by lead is increasingly recognized as a health hazard to children. Great. Another one for you, Maitreyi."
No," How does medication affect using for attention deficit disorder affect children's brain long term? So attention deficit disorder is a particular diagnosis, one also that has a body of literature relating it to lead exposure, early life exposure, which is an aside, and not really the answer to this particular question. So the medicines that are used to treat attention deficit"
No," disorder generally are a class of medications called stimulants, not unlike the coffee and the soda that we as adults use to increase our concentration. And the long term effects on children, one, they're short acting drugs, so they don't accumulate in the body like some of these other chemicals do."
No," so there's not a cancer risk for MRI. Why do children of a high risk of leukemia? Actually, I might have given you a misimpression. It's not that they have a high incidence. It's actually these tumors are rare in children. It's just when they get it, they're grouped into these big categories, and leukemia's one,"
No," say you've smoked for 20 years. And you say, OK, it's too late, I'm already too far gone. Not true. You stop smoking, your risk of lung cancer goes down 50% over the next two years. So when someone says that, just say, wow, you're really a fatalist, because you still"
Environment," we can do about it , reducing our exposure . So , first of all , these are chemicals that are found in the environment that have negative impact on our health and can affect fetal development and their greater than 85,000 chemicals that are in production and each year there are"
No," development . They can cause birth defects . They can interfere with genic general development of particularly of males . They can have effect on brain development and cause some neurobehavioral effects that can last into childhood , and then even learning"
No," more about now is that it also can affect the fertility of future generations than an exposure that a woman has during her life and her pregnancy could Affect the fertility of her grandchildren , so just a brief word that there 's been studies showing that"
No," this , and the answer is complex , but obviously other factors are playing a role and we know that women are having children later in life and that rates of infertility increase as a woman ages . But it 's also possible that one major contributing factor may be environmental"
No," flooring and not any vinyl products like shower curtains or bath mats , and then you know in baby toys a lot of teething toys unless they 're labeled as they late free . They often contain phthalates , which can be for a child , a very high level exposure if they 're , if they 're chewing"
No," study for future families and in this study they took a group of pregnant women and they had urine samples to check the level of fail , eights that were in their urine and then the pregnancies continued . The children were born and when they 're about 1 year old , they"
No," brought the children in for an exam to measure these distances and look for an effect . And then this slide shows that they actually they did find a an effect and actually a very strong one . That , as you get to a more darker red towards the right , this is a this is a type of Fey"
No," light . So this is the most common and what seems to be the most relevant to develop mental health that , as you get into the higher level here in the 75th percentile that you have a 13 higher time higher likelihood of having this shorter anal genital distance . They also"
No," , and they showed that for the women here who also had the higher level exposure exposure . They also noted that when they were for 27 years old , when these children were were in young childhood , that the women with the highest exposure here had the highest likelihood of"
No," in a lot of canned food lining . But it 's some of the highest concentrations are in acidic foods like tomatoes that could otherwise leach into the metal . This is used as a lining between the metal and the food it had been used in dental sealants . Actually , receipt paper contains"
No," this is the theory for how it can be linked to breast cancer . I'Ll talk a lot more about miscarriage and infertility suggestion it could cause early sexual maturation , and this is definitely relevant to children - that this has been shown to pass past the placenta and can"
Environment," this is what this is polychlorinated biphenyls - this was banned in the sem 1979 , but unfortunately this still persist in the environment . It 'S very difficult to break down . It was used in a lot of like electrical things like transformers and coolants paints and"
No, pick wild salmon over farmed . So some of the potential impacts that this can have on reproductive health . Pcbs actually are linked to a lot of things . They'Re also an endocrine disruptor : they affect the brain development in a child . They can cause birth defects in male infants .
Environment," do actually to reduce our exposure . So , first in general - and I think education is the major major way we can make a difference , and this affects everybody . But I think it affects mostly pregnant women or women who are planning to conceive women with young infants who"
No," bpafree , so there 's bpafree water bottles , baby bottles now and canned foods just prep running out of time . Family exposure similar things using looking for sale , 8 , free products , glass bottles , avoiding vinyl and PVC and limiting use of plastic food , wrap and"
Environment," and educate ourselves , because well , our bodies are designed to process toxins , but our environments and our physical bodies are overloaded with toxins on a daily basis and when we begin to overload our bodies and it ca n't process the toxins . Quick enough and we begin to"
Environment, So environmental toxins are toxins that are inside and outside our homes in the environment . In the air things we breathe so think about anything that you breathe in the air smells can be toxic . This could be things like plugins into bacterial sprays . Anything like that that
Environment," you breathe pollution , of course , that those are toxic things if they 're not allnatural . In addition , physical toxins come from eating and drinking as well as things that we rub on our bodies on our skin on our face and our hair . All of these"
Environment," So um again , i speak about this too . There 'S joy , not only with health . Is there food there 's fitness finances , relationships , creativity , career education , all those"
Environment," So , where are these toxins found um so you 'll be surprised to learn um , that environmental toxins are widespread , more widespread than pollution and pesticides , and i did n't really realize that"
No," from chronic illness . Okay , it 's chronic diseases and these illnesses leave . You know people feeling um in a continuous state of exhaustion , mental fogginess , anxiety"
Environment," , um , physical pain and many other symptoms . So , like i said , i have been um in environments where i 've been around new carpet , for example , and within about an hour i started"
Environment," I felt fine . I went back into that environment the next day and it only took like an hour this time from being there all day to just an hour in that environment to feel awful and sick . And so that 's new carpet , for example , can"
Environment," basically off gas into the environment and where our bodies are exposed to it , we breathe it in other people in the environment , they could smell it , but did n't bother"
Environment," them right and um , but we had the air tested and Sure enough we had formaldehyde in in that environment , and so i could n't i could n't be in there . I could n't do it so for me , an environmental toxin like that makes me terribly sick"
Environment," , awfully sick and so um anyway um that exhaustion . I have that fogginess . I also got very anxious , especially the second day when i realized it was the environment i just had to get out . I"
No," wanted to run . I had high anxiety , okay , and so that 's something to to think about . So how are the toxins these toxins affecting our health impacting our health ? I gave an example"
No," that 's a collection of glands that produce hormones that regulate metabolism , growth and development tissue function , sexual function , reproductive reproduction , sleep and mood among other things , and so one"
No, in our bodies . So the result of the hormone disruption - again i mentioned a little bit ago - is we can have chronic diseases so um and they 're learning more and more about these diseases that are caused by these
No," um in contact with them . Our bodies do n't know how to handle them , and we were n't really meant to have to handle them right . So if we know that hormones are responsible for all major aspects of our health , from that sleep from the"
Environment," So that brings me to the next topic is how to avoid them : okay , how to avoid bpa exposure - and it 's really important , so it can be hard because you know um , it 's prevalent in the environment . Um"
Environment," your food and do n't wash plastic containers in the dishwasher again , because that can leach leach , that out into the environment and not to use Harsh detergents on them , so one thing i 've done is i 've replaced"
No," toys . I know choose wooden toys instead of plastic , but when we think about it here we are giving our child a toy , that 's plastic and it 's probably got bpa in it , and so as an early"
No, um early um . You know growing child you 're getting exposed to this . So um the next one is phthylates um . They are group of chemicals used to make
No," plastics um more flexible and harder to break so they 're commonly found in in plastic , food containers , children 's toys and makeup products . Okay , so it 's important that we pay attention"
No," so avoid them again , start by buying plastic food containers , children 's toys plastic wrap made from pvc and which has the recycling label number three . So recycling label number three ."
Environment," So um , you know they uh , trace amounts of heavy metals exist in our environment and um and naturally exist in our bodies , but increased exposure to them can pose some health challenges for sure"
Environment," our environment . Mercury poisoning can be marked with headaches , low back pain , weakness , fatigue , tremors and hallucinations , and pregnant women are the most risk for"
No, with our fertility and damage our ability to be fertile . So here 's another one right here : congenital disabilities and worsen allergies and asthma
No," contact with the ground so um , just because it 's in The ground right , but you wo n't know whether it 's in your home , unless you have it tested , so it 's worth testing for so next is smoking ."
No," Radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer , so um to reduce radon exposure , seal the floors and the walls . Excuse me increase underfloor ventilation and overall ventilation . Close the"
No," basement off from the rest of the house . Have the water tested through through a drinking water , testing , laboratory and radon can be moved through treatment technology . So that 's really good , such as aeration or granular activated carbon . So you can do something"
Environment," , as in boy f and frank . Are they 're used commercially from from natural fiber to household furniture to plastic ? So they do n't stick to the materials that they 're put on , so they filter into our environment , so that leaves uh ."
Environment," There have been numerous studies that have reported high levels of fire retardance in breast milk , so i think we need to be wise to the fact that , when we 're in an environment that has these things , we breathe it in it comes in through our skin . All of"
No," I did n't even think i was going to say that , but i 'm very pleased with ours and me being so sensitive . I had no worries and i did n't need to let it off gas before i slept on it . Um"
Environment," avoid it all right . Toxin number , eight , i know there 's a lot . This is the final one promise . Okay , the final toxin is particle pollution . So particle pollution can range from its dust"
Environment," , mold and fungus particles uh to chemical compounds from fuel emissions all right , so the number one source of air pollution in many cities is automobile emissions . However"
Environment," , this is it if you 're , a landscaper you 're on uh you 're in the hot seat , landscaping industry accounts for up to 10 of air pollution in the united states , and it 's the gas leaf . Blower has been"
Environment," makes me nauseous . This happens to my mom . They go by her place and they just ruin the environment with these horrible things . So try and get if you have a leaf , blower try and get a battery operated one and um"
Environment," particle pollution , particle pollution in the air on our health , so climate common effects include wheezing , coughing , sharpness of breath and lung tissue swelling , which contributes contributes to heart and lung disease , asthma attacks and lung"
Environment," swap the gas powered lawn mowers , leaf blowers and weed whackers for electrical again environmental pollution of vehicles . If you can take public transportation , do that , if you can ride your bike , so"
No," One of these things really helped me with my mom 's place was um her air quality seemed kind of you know it just had this weird feeling around it , and so i bought this and she likes to burn a little bit of water on the stove to create Humidity , well , what i"
Environment," um help out your environment and also getting those filtered hepa filter type fans that will clean the air out for you . So , lastly , this bottom line is that environmental toxins"
No," as well as garlic and onions , and they can help your body detoxify . Of course , if you have a sensitivity or you 're allergic to any of those , do n't eat that one okay , but see how many real good whole foods you can get into your diet"
No," I think it is true earth . Oh well , there goes there . I go again talking about another product . I did n't intend to but true earth check them out . Um . I hope that 's right , but i started using their laundry detergent . It has nothing in it and they 're actually"
Environment," little sheets , so the environmental impact . I get a ton of laundry detergent in a cardboard box and no big plastic container anymore , so check those out . Here 'S one really good for you exercise . You want to sweat"
Environment," Do some research um . You know make a little bit of investment to make sure your home 's in good shape and see if you can get yourself um to where you have an environment , that is n't as that"
Environment," environment , that you 're not aware of that , you might be getting exposed to something like That so , if you are suffering from some chronic illness or you just do n't feel right , something might be wrong . You know find an integrated doctor or find a doctor that"
Environment," Park in Amsterdam , the Netherlands , I have a background in public health and epidemiology and today we 'll be talking about social and physical environments and how they influence health and how we can use these environments to promote public health . So , just to start off with"
Environment," little bit about my own physical and social environments . So this is Rotterdam or a simplified version in Rotterdam for but for those who 've been there , you may recognize the skyline . It 'S a really nice city . I love living there , it 's a little bit of gray , but I cycle everywhere . I"
No," cycle to the shops to the station to my friends and family , because that is really easy . There are cycle lanes everywhere and when there are no cycle lanes , it is still very safe because the cars are really careful around cyclists . I actually do not have a car , I do n't"
Environment," these individual resources that I have gained from having a high education really have helped me navigate through life . I would say , and also through the environment that I live in , I can really use my own personal resources to make the most of what the city is offering me"
Environment," in terms of finding shops that I want to go to or finding the recreational facilities that are Available , yes , I benefit quite a lot from my education as well . I like horse riding , and luckily there is a nice park in Rotterdam where there 's a horse riding center , and I go"
Environment," there five days a week , it 's nice and green . So I spend a lot of time outdoors , while also living in the city . So that 's really very nice and of course , my social environment is so very important to me . I have my friends and family living in Rotterdam"
No," there are horses in Wellington . I have n't found them . I do n't have the time to go we 're trying to , unfortunately , but I think it would be very beautiful here as well and of course I have a social network here as well . Colleagues and friends that I enjoyed a"
No," company off and , as I said before , it 's really really easy to keep in touch with friends and family in Europe as well through modern technologies and then one more picture before we go off on to the research and evidence . And this is the cover of my PhD thesis , which was on"
Environment," obesogenic environments , really illustrating that the environment can make it much more difficult for individuals to be healthy and to maintain a healthy lifestyle . If you try to push a rock open to the onto a hill and that Hill is really very steep , the"
Environment," environment is really hindering you in achieving a healthy lifestyle and at health in general . That is much more difficult than when you know the environment is helping . When it 's actually much more flat , so this is all anecdotal and I think we can"
Environment," all relate to the fact that social and physical environments are important for our mental and physical health . But let 's see what is out there , I 'm in the evidence base . So before we head off , maybe some terminology and theory to make sure that we 're all on the same"
Environment," Misao level , so community or neighborhood environments and the social and physical aspects of those and so focusing on the out of home environments . Sorry , Phillip and housing is also very important and today will focus on there . Yeah kind of the meter level and I 'll show you some"
Environment," examples of evidence on how the social and physical neighborhood environments influence health outcomes . This is an example from the UK showing the relation between area level , deprivation and life expectancy in the blue bars and healthy life expectancy in"
No," neighborhood deprivation can actually lead to UM . Worse health outcomes are a number of causal paths , including behavioral , psychosocial and material factors . That may explain these associations , such as um higher prevalence of smoking and alcohol"
Environment," use in more deprived areas , a lack of social support or feelings of social and crime safety , but also deprived areas , may have less access to facilities , health care facilities , but also recreational facilities . For example , and may be less aesthetically , nice and less cream and"
No," important to remember that this can work both ways , so you can have role models that are very healthy , but also role models that are unhealthy . So if you have a community and where people tend to have in healthier lifestyles , then this may also help actually to spread obesity"
No," are more important for spreading obesity than others so having mutual friends with obesity , but also spouses , siblings and especially samesex siblings , who have obesity , increase your own risk of becoming obese over time . And this is an example from my colleagues in Amsterdam"
No," who used a Dutch court studies to link several neighborhood factors to the prevalence and severity of depression , and I 've just highlighted the two social environmental factors that they investigated . So , in Figure B you can see a relation between area level"
Environment," , socioeconomic status and the prevalence and severity of depression and in Figure G , the area , level , safety . And you can quite clearly see that in areas where , in higher socioeconomic ly , in areas with higher socioeconomic status and better safety and people had a lower prevalence"
No," and lower severity of depression . And this is again some results from a European study where we linked neighborhood environmental factors to how happy people are , and Happiness is obviously quite strongly related to health . But happiness on"
Environment," more happy . But when we looked at these subjective measures , we found that also safety and the functionality of the neighborhood . So how well ? How many destinations are there ? Are there enough pavements etc was associated with more feelings of happiness ? And I think this"
Environment," quite clearly shows that we need to take into account both objectively measured environments and people 's perceptions about them , because we may think that , for example , we have improved safety objectively in a neighborhood , but if individuals do n't"
Environment," perceive their neighborhood to be safer , they Will not benefit from their environment and in this study also from this European study , where we showed the mismatch between objective and subjective measures . In some cases , there is really a very big mismatch and , for"
Environment," urban environments to mental health . Well , first of all , I need to say that the evidence for these associations is still quite weak and inconsistent . I think much more studies need to be done about the influence of our living environments on mental health outcomes . I think this is a"
Environment, fatigue . Neighbours can help in having a good social support . Network neighborhoods can have an influence on mental health through getting insufficient daylight . Noise and air pollution have been linked to mental health outcomes and also feelings of
Environment, safety in the neighborhood and - and I think these are factors that we could address through working on neighborhood and environmental interventions . So the evidence on environmental factors related to physical health are numerous . So a lot of reviews have been done on
Environment, So I 'll just show you some of the examples that of studies that we 've done since then . So this is a study on objective measures and perceived measures of the built environment . Related to cycling for transport - and here we found quite consistently Yoos
Environment," using both objective data and people 's perceptions that a low maximum traffic speed and was associated with more cycling . So in areas where the maximum traffic speed was , for example , 30 kilometers an hour and were much more likely to cycle for"
Environment," transportation and also the availability of bicycle lanes and the perception of better Street connectivity so having more routes to choose from on your bicycle was Quite consistently associated with cycling group portrait for transport , then we also found some"
Environment," old associations at first glance , seeing that having more litter in the streets and more parked cars on the road and less traffic calming devices such as um , several paths or traffic lights or speed . Bumps was also associated with more cycling , but going back to the data , we"
Environment," realized that some of the very quiet areas with very few cars were actually those areas with a lot of parked cars on the road and less traffic calming devices so d. They may be areas where these device search is not necessary , and then we also found that if people"
Environment," perceived the air to be more polluted and areas not to be pleasant for walking or cycling that they cycled more for transportation . And thinking about that , this may be explained by well . People might may want to have a very nice area to cycling if they do that for leisure"
Environment," traffic that causes air pollution , and maybe these areas are not so nice or pleasant to Walk recycling but it 's actually quite a functional environment for cycling . If you think about cycling for transportation and again , I think having these insights on both objective"
Environment," measures and subjective measures of the environment is quite insightful , and this is a study from my colleague Marty Pullman in at the Utrecht University shown how the food environment is associated . With cardiovascular diseases - and she said"
Environment," that , for the Dutch context and higher fast food outlet density was associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular heart disease and coronary heart disease and my PhD student Gabi Matias . Lupino did this work on how the food environment has changed"
Environment," the method . Methodological explanations for inconsistent results in the literature because , when we split these analyses of trends in food environment over time by area level socioeconomic status , we actually saw for the fast food"
Environment," Neighbors , and these trends are all significant , as well as the interruption by area level . Ses . And if you do n't see these trends stratified by socioeconomic status , you may come to completely different conclusions about what is happening in the food environment . So"
Environment, yeah . I think stratifying by area level and the profession may be quite important when thinking about food environments - and we saw a similar thing when looking at the interaction between having access to supermarkets in the UK and educational attainment and in this
Environment, access to supermarkets and having a low educational attainment at almost four times the odds of being obese compared to individuals having a high education and living closer to than your supermarkets . And this is again an example where it 's a little bit more
Environment," of social safety in the city , but actually not in Very strongly urban areas in those areas having more green space was associated with less social safety . So the context in which this is studied is really quite important , so , after showing some of these examples - and"
No," we may want to so what is the potential for Public Health ? We there have been quite a lot of studies on how environmental factors influence our health outcomes , both mental and physical health . But what should we take into account thinking of what we can do in"
Environment," without requiring a lot of individual agency . You do n't have to rely on people 's own cognitive and material resources to change their health for the good , because the environment could really help them . Making those changes without using those personal resources"
No," , and so environmental interventions are really much more likely to reach filner relations and then individual level interventions , and I think also when thinking of environmental interventions , we could create a synergy between health benefits , but also environmental"
Environment," sustainability benefits . All at the same time , because the environment is influencing so much more than just health outcomes , and this potential may also result in more interest from other sectors than the health sector . If you can combine those interests of different"
Environment," environment , and this is just a simple graph of one indicator : population density to show major differences between Cities across the globe , so in Amsterdam , on average , there is a population density of more than 5,000 inhabitants per square kilometre , while"
Environment," in Wellington this is approximately 750 and just the basic characteristics of these environments may have a big influence on the association 's that you study and Actually , the association 's that you observe , because there may be a hierarchy of environmental factors that"
No," influence health outcomes and , for example , in Amsterdam , where there are already a lot of cycle lanes and people cycle everywhere . The explanatory value or the benefits of having more cycle lanes may be almost zero and if you do n't study the benefits of cycle lanes"
Environment," , in a lot of the reviews that I also showed earlier , and a lot of , the primary studies that were included did not take into account any of these potential differences between high And low socioeconomic groups and the environment may really have a very"
No," that of those interventions . For what for narrowing . These inequalities before we actually start implementing them in real life , and when thinking of interventions , I think we should , you know really consider very consciously , but do we want to achieve who , with what people need to"
No," also maybe a lot of food outlets and a lot of other facilities , and so and it 's quite difficult in these observational studies to pull these factors apart and also when thinking of policies . We should think about whole neighborhoods or whole areas at the target and not just focus"
Environment," health , but for people who received our neighborhood to be unsafe , they may not benefit from this green space at all . So this interaction between social and physical environment effectors should definitely also be taken into account . I think it 's also important to realize"
No," that some of these associations that I 've shown are not necessarily causal associations . Obviously , when thinking of environmental factors , it 's really hard to do a randomized control trial . So a lot of the evidence is coming from observational studies and there are some"
Environment," accommodates these preferences , so that 's a form of direct self selection . What is actually more common is indirect self selection on the basis of socioeconomic status . So , with a certain income , you can only live in certain neighborhoods and more disadvantaged . Neighborhoods may"
Environment," also have more disadvantaged physical and social environments , and this is especially important when thinking about neighborhood policies in neighborhood interventions , because you would n't want to renew a certain neighborhood and then with the consequence that the"
No," mobility effects , but still this can differ between different contexts . So it 's definitely something to take into account , but we 've talked quite a bit now on how you know complexities and there are all kinds of factors that influence health outcomes . But this complexity"
No," should not lead to inaction and we do have a pretty good feeling of what type of social and environmental factors contribute to public health . And we should n't let , for example , alcohol gambling food industries and use the argument of complexity to not take any"
Environment," we 're quite aware of what the opportunities are of improving social and physical environments . And we should go into action about it . That is the end of my talk . If you 're interested in this topic feel free to visit their websites and extreme team Danelle , extreme team is"
Environment," last couple of screens , I 'm very aware that gambling is in the lowest socioeconomic areas in New Zealand and they often have the poorest transport facilities and infrastructure . So these just these two things , could hugely influenced the mental health of the"
No," facilities and options for healthy foods . So I think the situation in the Netherlands is a bit different , but thinking about the situation in New Zealand , I do think that this situation warrants action and definitely - and I was at the Ministry of Health this morning"
No," , and they did a sort of earlier version of looking at resources that innercity areas and the lowincome areas are in many cases , depending on where they were set up or actually got lots of Resources and lots of green space , it 's the kind of postwar , unplanned communities which are"
No," mixture . I mean in some cases , there 's very mixed communities in another cases , recently they 're much more than shaded , so that makes it more complicated even again in terms of and Wellington is very different from Auckland yeah I mean I do think that the the general message would"
Environment," compared to , for example , in the South islands , where people really need a car , and I think , having this transportation network will really help people and access more healthcare facilities and And benefit from their environments a bit more"
Environment," outcomes , so I always have this discussion with colleagues . You know if you had the choice , to make environments healthier or eradicate poverty . You know what would you choose and what would have the biggest impact on public health and , obviously , and if we would be able to"
No," of people , know different things are based on difference and beliefs , and things like that . So have you seen any examples of successful ways of unders like getting the understanding to happen so that more change can happen , because it 's obviously"
Environment," not just up to like government environments to make things happen ? People have to make the change as well , but a lot of people do n't understand that . So have you seen anything like that ? Yeah so yeah really good question and there have been a number of projects in"
Environment," the Netherlands on making neighborhood environments healthier , and one of the starting point from these projects were well from the point of the interventionists . We wanted to . You know improve health outcomes , for example , focus on obesity or mental health"
No," outcomes , but they decided to go into these communities without expressing their own interests and asking you know what would be your preferences ? What how do you want to change your life ? What would be good for you , and sometimes those are very different topics that"
No," environmental interventions can help serve multiple goals and I think , trying to find that link between communities , preferences and also taking to account the benefits for Public Health is really quite Helpful and be clear about it , you know also be clear about your own"
Environment," interest as an interventionist , but also in many ways . Our environment has changed quite a lot over the past , and people like people have not been consulted about that , like our , our life environments have changed over time and we have just adapted ourselves to those"
Environment," environments . So , in a sense , I also think it 's quite alright to change some of those environments back to healthier environments with out actively consulting a lot of different groups of people , because we just know that it 's better for health ."
No," But I think in some instances where it 's , for example , very important to have culturally appropriate changes , then such an approach to find that common ground on the interests of the community and interests of the public health interventionist , could work and yeah"
No," there 's examples in the Netherlands . They work quite well finally trying to find a balance . They take a little bit more time than usual projects , but in the end I think it 's worth it because you 've engaged community with those decisions in New Zealand . We have one of the most"
Environment," beautiful environments and we 're very lucky , because we have good one to keep our ear pure , but we also have a very high rate of suicide in . So how do you reconcile those two things , the the beautiful environment and , up until recently , it has n't been so obvious how"
Environment," spoilt it has been and the suicide rate mmhmm ? I think - and we really need to acknowledge that it 's not just our social and physical environments at the city or a neighborhood level that influence our mental and physical health outcomes , and"
Environment, play a big role in it . So I think we should also be careful in not being over optimistic about what we can do through neighborhood or city environments . We wo n't be able to solve everything all the public health problems so yeah . I think it 's good to acknowledge that and
Environment," that it should n't only look at those environments but also think a little bit bigger and do think about our trade agreements and national laws and social welfare systems and how those bigger factors influence our populations . Health , yeah . That 'S a good point . Thank you so"
Environment," Financial freedom can mean having enough money to live life . On your terms , however , no one wants to live on an insanely low income . Why spend more energy trying to save on small expenses than you devote to working and earning"
Environment," could not cover a four hundred dollar , unexpected expense . Poor money management can really be a problem . Most of us will have some unexpected things pop up throughout the year , such as car repairs , medical bills or even a loss of income ."
Environment," could allow you to start a business , take a reduction and pay for a better opportunity in another field to work or advance your education . You might want to save up for an extended vacation where you will do some traveling before you 're physically"
Environment," financial freedom date or you could simply choose to use that discretionary income on an item or experience of your choice . This , of course , assumes you avoid increasing your lifestyle spending by moving up in house , buying more expensive vehicles and"
No," taking more elaborate trips level , four enough to not have to work as much . What many people desire is more flexibility with their schedules . Freedom of time and financial independence go hand in hand"
No," together . They are about leaving the rat race to follow your passion or spend more time with family and not sacrifice your financial wellbeing . It could come in the form of more paid time off flex time , perhaps working remotely on occasion or"
No," than what you 're currently spending when you retire travel expenses , are likely to go way up ? If you enjoy traveling due to the extra time off and flexibility , you have you 'll , probably find yourself going out to eat more often golfing"
Environment," income streams to be in a position to retire . Well , some people get a thrill out of being frugal . Like mr money , mustache but others see , retirement is a time to relax . Let loose within reason and not have to worry about each penny ."
No," Would it include things like traveling , more and spending more time with friends and family traveling the world flying first class and staying in nice hotels does n't come cheap and either does a second home on the beach or in the mountains ?"
No," What would really bring joy into your life , maybe enough money to support a fairly luxurious lifestyle and help your family out now , and then , how great would it feel knowing you 're on track to have enough money to retire and be able to live your dream life ?"
Environment," spend . This is the most exclusive level of financial freedom . Hopefully , your financial freedom plan will allow your money to outlive you , as it should having more income than you expected to"
No," of companies like bill gates , warren buffett or jeff bezos . Even if they went on a spending spree , they would still have a hard time spending . All of it , in fact , most of your energy , would probably be spent thinking how you could"
No," Core values are an incredibly important part of our life and the thing is a lot of us . Don'T really know what our core values are , because we 're basically living by them , but they 're all at that subconscious"
No," level . So , basically core values . They act like a compass to help . You lead the amazing life that you want , and it 's no matter where you may find yourself within this world . Your core values will always show up ."
No," You know not only that right having the right core values . They can improve . Your decision making they can help with your productivity . They can help you maximize your achievements and perhaps , most importantly , your"
No," ability to be loved and also to love , as you can gather , they are a big deal and it is n't just saying this . Scientific studies have shown how core values have a whole host of other"
No," benefits , so core values - they can be a number of things . They can be personal values of things that are important to us . They could be characteristics and behaviors that motivate us and guide our"
Environment, understanding what that is . So there are a number of different ways that you can begin to find your core values so i 'll go through an exercise now some ideas as to how you can go and find
No," these and then i 'll offer some more resources that i 've found useful myself . So the key with your values is that you should n't really have any more than five . What you may find , if you do have more , is that some of those values are actually"
No," and just remind yourself of how they lived their life , the things they believed in the values that they had the things that they consistently demonstrated the words that they said"
No, how they said it so by reflecting on actions of people who are close To us who have inspired us that can be a sign of what our own values are .
No," It could be connection relating to that family could be wealth , could be growth , development progression , health wealth . You know just try to list out as many"
No," further , then go down to six or five and then go down even further . If you need to so there 's two ways that you can begin to identify your values , there 's a third"
Environment, one which is very similar to the last exercise that i 've just demonstrated . You can actually go on to google and find tools to help with this . So it 's like drag and drop exercises
No," where you you 're presented with just have described a big list of values that other people have demonstrated and lived their life . By and from that , you begin to pull some of those values into your own list"
Environment," , and then you go through that very same exercise that i mentioned before , where you then take that list and narrow it down further until you 're at the core . Where , essentially , you do n't want to lose any more of those values from that list"
No," Hello : everyone , my name is jerry wise and i 'm a lifelong relationship . Coach i 've been helping people for many decades with selfdifferentiation , overcoming codependency and other kinds of adult children issues , and i want to mention"
No," : there 's a workshop coming up on december 5th 2020 on saturday . I hope you 'll sign up for that workshop , go to the website under events , and you can sign up for that . Please join this"
No," not mistaken today , is number seven yeah and this principle is called differentiation is being clear about one 's own personal values and boundaries , and when i think about this principle there"
No," , the values and boundaries are two ends of of selfdifferentiation . It 'S where you start it 's , what 's real real for you inside , and what you communicate to people or to the to your family , to your friends , to"
No," or maturity - is a very selfdefining work and since it 's a selfdefining work , that means we have to define ourselves . You know what do i believe . What do i value ? What what 's important to me ? How do i do ?"
No," I believe the earth is flat or do i believe it 's round . You know , because that will guide my life uh depending upon what i believe and um and then what do i do in the face of believing the earth is flat , but everyone else believes it 's"
No," - these books they 're not easy to read , but they are very insightful , integrating spirituality and and uh . Psychology and he talks ab and - and that was kind of one of my first introductions to kind of growing up or"
No," maturing before i got into murray , bowen family theory , and he said one thing that adults do is that they begin to give up . Staying in the no man 's land"
No," , because there again , if i hold on to the tightly to that , the world is flat And i do n't take in the other data , then i may believe the world is flat until i die . You know and that may be holding on to that belief too tightly ."
No," I may begin to learn about as they send back pictures from space and show the world is round , i 'm going , oh well , maybe the world is n't flat , yeah yeah and very often the values that we are committed to"
No," , because i think a lot of people are committed To certain values a lot of times the values we 're committed to they 're , not ours , we were raised into them . We did n't give it any extra thought we did n't ."
No," Obviously , we do some type of research growing up , but very often we never really question those values . And for me this principle is allowing yourself to question your values , to question the values of your family , to question the values of"
No, of using a selffilter on family beliefs and family values that i want to use a selffilter about that are these my beliefs or are they not ? I can believe something . My family taught
No," me and not be differentiated . I can believe something my family taught me and be selfdifferentiated , because not only do i might . I have different beliefs , but i may accept some of the beliefs . My"
No," family did teach me and they be , they are mine . I i do accept that uh and so believe so that , but i do n't accept beliefs that keeps me keep me in a particular role . You know , and so you know my family may have"
No," other people in the same way my family was doing it . Now i 'm more enmeshed with them and it 's not my value , maybe we 're doing it to keep an image . Maybe we 're doing it to earn our way to heaven . Maybe we 're"
No," doing it . You know and uh . So there may be some similar values we have , but am i still running it through the self filter ? It 'S got to all go through myself . Filter . Is this jerry"
No," , or is this just jerry with group , think or society think or you know , whatever think you know i might be connected to yeah i in other words i do n't . I could not believe the same um the same values"
No," , but i could still be undifferentiated . Doing that i could believe something different , but i will still be undifferentiated , so it could go either way . I could believe something that the family believes and be"
No," undifferentiated or differentiated . I could not believe what the family believes and be undifferentiated or not differentiated or differentiated , and the issue becomes is this me : is this"
No," mine , you know , have i sent it through that filter and it really is my belief and for many of us that 's where a Lot of the struggles come in with family of origin issues , particularly when we become adults"
No," where now we have the challenge of beliefs and we go through a second adolescence . The first adolescence is we 're trying to have you know the solid family that we push off or push away from to become ourselves . But then , as we"
No," become adults , we have another opportunity to do that , because then there are expectations of us as adults , not as teenagers , but how you 're supposed to function in the family as an adult now . Well , we may need to push off of that as"
No, um our values . So i i think about also the aloneness that comes with it and and off and often you talk about aloneness versus loneliness and to define your values often means you 're going to be
No," standing alone . But when you understand that you 're allowed to have different values and others are allowed to have different values than than you have , then you do n't necessarily feel lonely"
No," and being able to also in some ways connect with others too , because if i Never declare myself if i never have values . If i do n't know what i believe who i am and what i think , if i 'm just a product of my family of"
No," origin and it 's thinking , if that 's all , i am , then i 'm only going to be comfortable pretty much relating connecting to my family or people who Are like that , if i 'm defining myself , i may find new"
No, people whom value that my values and um and i value their and be okay and be okay with people that have different values without it and without it needing some disconnection there
No, right . Can i connect with someone that we have differing values ? Can i accept and connect with someone or differing beliefs or differing principles ? Um i mean that 's . What we hope will happen on a political level in
No," that often people 's values could be immature values so well . Also , our own values could often be immature , but but i 'm when i 'm thinking you mentioned the political situation and and how often we could see other"
No," people 's choices as being immature regardless if they are immature or not right , uh . But but people are allowed to have immature values , um , and i have no right to take that away from them"
No," same like they have no right to take my values away from me , yeah , but yet they 're just wrong . That 'S true ! They are wrong should n't . I do something about that . They are wrong , but they are allowed to be wrong"
No," right and it also , i think , takes responsibility and owns the fact that you know not . Maybe every one of my values and beliefs are all correct . There may be some wrong ones in there"
No," or immature ones , and i hope someone is accepting of me as well in my wrongness , and i 've certainly been wrong before and we really care about those people who have winked at us and winked at our immaturity"
No," and did n't Shame us and guilt us and say that 's so stupid that you believe that - and you know , and and sometimes families will do that , but it 's more mature if we can accept others"
No," and their beliefs right or wrong , but we 're also accepting our limitations . At the same time , i i think self and those values and boundaries uh evolve from womb to adult . You know we it 's a lifetime of learning"
No," these things . These do n't have you do n't just wake up tomorrow and have all of your beliefs , values , principles all just lined out , but i think it is an intentional work that is good for us to do . You know when i come into conflict with"
No," my family , my spouse , my children , my whomever friends , do i take that moment and look at well . What do i believe wha ? What is my belief ? What are my principles ? What do i value and i had an example um"
No," and and and why i think , values are so important , because when you read about bow and family systems , there 's a lot of talk about values and principles , lead us away from blame and a lot of times . People do n't i did n't understand that ."
No," What do you mean values lead you away from blame shoot if i had more values , i 'd blame more people for what they 're you know . I mean that 's kind of the logical you know and no it actually leads us"
No," away from blame . Uh , because when we focus on our values , our principles , then we allow them to be a separate person and we do n't have to blame them and we 're also able to more freely look"
No," at our feedback , loop and our part in the feedback loop . I i had a client , that 's calling bill had a very , very meshed family , very hyper religious , very enmeshed"
No," he 's been working to detach and become a self uh versus being just a domino in his family and just be there , and i mean this family is incredibly enmeshed . Every week , every month everything they do is family"
No," , family , family . Everything and you are to attend , he 's an adult he 's divorced . He has two children , two younger children , and they assume that all family members attend all family , weekly and monthly gatherings"
No," and then some additional bible studies on zoom as well . So it 's it 's really just you know it has driven him nuts , since he was a kid to the point he could n't have friends . He could . There was nothing you could do"
No," outside the family . There 'S just nothing outside the family was supported and , of course , as he detaches they pursue relentlessly . You know , get him back and come on come back in the family and i think"
No," that 's where values versus blame and having differences versus anger and upsetment . It 'S upsetness because if we do n't have our own values , if we do n't see our own differences"
No," , then we 'll only be left with blame anger and upsetness see what they 're doing to me . Why do n't they stop ? You know when are they going to grow up ? When are they going to get healthy ? You know , that 's not somebody who has"
No," seen their own values and principles . If someone has their own values and principles says i do n't choose to do this . You may choose to continue to do that . I do n't need to change you , but i am not going to change that ."
No," Their boundaries are clear , correct , right and there 's more detachment , and so i do n't have to blame them for how miserable they 're making me rather than respecting what do i value ? What do i believe , what kind of relationship do i want to"
No, have with the family ? Not what dan and family expect and require me to do and about what boundaries am i setting or not setting with those people ? It 'S a it 's a selfdifferentiation journey .
No," uh our own values , to communicate them um , it 's about us , it 's not about them and the um . I think the well in the in the next principle , i 'll probably continue on with that example , because i think it 's also"
No," illustrative of the next principle we 're going to be talking about and i 'm hoping that we 'll uh , that example from that family will give us some more Clarity about selfdifferentiation , uh , but again , values , beliefs , convictions"
No," , principles , does a lot to differentiate ourselves , disconnect ourselves in a healthy way and reduces blaming anger and that feedback loop that we have in that relationship of fusion and enmeshment or whatever"
No," me and and this family was pretty relentless or unrelenting or whatever the word is they just continued and continued in every kind of way to make this happen and uh and it was , it could be very maddening ."
No," Yeah , there are definitely families that um that force the family values on the system and do n't allow any any form of uh being an individual inside the system and then and then it 's the and then it 's the struggle of"
No," finding our own values and creating our own Values and questioning the system , values and and well we 're questioning uh dealing with the anxiety and and the tension that comes up from"
No," miserable to stay in it . It can be difficult or painful to continue to differentiate . I just figure : if i 'm going to be uncomfortable , i might as be well be heading towards a positive goal . Then just stay in the discomfort"
No," of the group think or the pressure of the enmeshment that we have as a family , that i must do all these things and then i 'm resentful and mad . And you know and again i will blame others and again so many times . We blame others"
No," uh their job in their subjectivity in their way of thinking , is to keep the family system going as it always has . Your job is to uh out of that system rise as a phoenix and become yourself uh . In spite of uh and"
No," in opposition to the system , or at least in differentiation to the system , maybe that 's a better word that we can be different yeah . We should be different , yes , because we all are uniquely and some families a few of them value"
No, that uniqueness and some families . Don'T some families see that uniqueness as a threat and as and fearful because they have certain values of the way they think things should be .
No," Anything else you want to share about this today . Yes , yes , i have two things . The first is actually a quote of view from before this call that says it 's out of our values that our boundaries come ."
No," You need some values to determine boundaries , and i just did n't want to let that slip through , because there 's uh there 's a lot of insight into that , and the other thing that i would like to to to um to close"
No, up . I guess this at this principle is when we have our own values and they are really ours like meaning . We'Ve done the work of owning those values and standing for them . Then we do n't need others to understand
No," to agree to accept our val those values . We do n't need to force our values on other people , they 're ours . Other people could choose differently and value other things . We need um , it 's about allowing others have"
No," values and opinions that we do n't agree with . That is sometimes something that could be hard . We could believe in something , and yet we do n't understand how someone could have a value that does n't go with with ours"
No," and it 's what you stand for is not what others stand for , and i think that 's just understanding as a basic . Just as the basics of determining your own values and letting other people"
No, determine their own is understanding that values is not about everyone agreeing to the same thing . It 'S about you believing what you believe in and and that 's the end and then there 's one last paradoxical
No," part of that . If you want other people to change their values and beliefs , believe yours , because then we 're not actively trying to change them , we are being ourselves and us in the"
No, system with our values that sends ripples through the through the system . But it 's i 'm not doing it to change other people 's values . It 'S it 's that intentional paradoxical work that when i am more myself
No," I want to thank you all for joining us today . We'Ve got another principle we 're going to be talking about , and i hope you 'll watch that video as well . This one is video 7 of the principles and i hope you will join the youtube"
No," channel . Click join become a member for a small amount . Each month helps support the videos that we do , and i want to thank yitz for joining me today and thank you for having me . I hope you guys"
No," Hi welcome back to the dr o'donovan medicine made easy youtube channel in today 's video i 'm going to be covering potential warning features of lung cancer , also known as red flag features . These are signs that essentially mean someone might have a lung cancer , and you"
No," Now , there 's two important things to know : those are people who 've had a chest : xray finding that suggest lung cancer or those people aged 14 over with unexplained hemoptysis , which is coughing up of blood . So , for example , if a 50 year old woman comes to your clinic with"
No," chest . Xray symptoms include cough fatigue , shortness of breath , chest pain , weight loss and appetite loss . The final part of the guideline is worded slightly differently . There are"
No," other symptoms , but you should use your clinical judgment and consider offering an urgent chest xray . So if the patient is aged 14 over and has a persistent or recurrent chest infection finger clubbing , as you can see in the photo on screen here , supraclavicular"
No," lymphadenopathy or persistent surface lymphadenopathy and chest signs consistent with lung cancer and finally thrombocytosis , which is a raised . Platelet count you could consider a chest xray within two weeks , so let 's take a look at an example of"
No," this an example might be a patient who comes in with a persistent parent chest infection that does n't seem to budge . Despite multiple causes of antibiotics , you need to think maybe i 've got the antibiotics wrong , or maybe they might have an underlying lung cancer . It 'S"
No," worth remaining vigilant for this also remember that if you 've got a high clinical suspicion of lung cancer , but the chest xray is reported as normal still consider seeking specialist input , and this is because up to 20 of lung cancers can be missed on chest xrays . So"
No," i hope this video makes the guidelines as clear as possible and will help you in your future clinical practice . It 'S always useful to know these symptoms and signs it 's worth being vigilant for them and if you 're , a patient watching this video and you 've got any concerns . Please"
Environment," see your nearest healthcare professional as ever . I hope you enjoyed the video . You learned something new and if you did please consider subscribing to join 30 000 other learners on this channel , the new medical education content , which i produce every wednesday and every sunday"
No," Whizzing , when lying down main causes , whizzing is a sensation that occurs when a person breathes through obstructed airways . Some people find that their wheezing gets worse when lying down ."
No," which could trigger a cough . Whizzing is a common symptom of asthma , allergies , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea . In this video , we will take a closer look at the potential causes of wheezing when lying down and their treatments ."
No," We will also provide tips on how to sleep while experiencing this symptom . Asthma . Asthma is a chronic condition that affects over 300 million people worldwide . It is characterized by coughing , wheezing"
No," or shortness of breath . It is common for asthma symptoms to affect people at night . This is known as nocturnal asthma . The symptoms of nocturnal asthma can include chest : tightness , shortness of breath , coughing wheezing ."
No," According to the united kingdom charity asthma , uk nocturnal asthma can be a sign that a person 's asthma is not well controlled . People with asthma symptoms at night may be at risk for asthma"
No," attacks . Doctors can prescribe preventive inhalers to improve breathing people can use this regularly . To maintain reduced asthma symptoms , emergency inhalers can help with sudden and sometimes"
No, severe symptoms . Those with allergies may find that identifying and removing the allergen helps along with taking an antihistamine obstructive sleep apnea obstructive sleep . Apnea is a serious
No," medical condition that causes a decrease or abrupt hold in airflow , while sleeping this occurs due to the relaxation of the pharyngeal muscles and soft tissues which are located at the back of the throat . This blocks"
No," , the airways disrupting breathing the symptoms of symptoms of sleep , apnea include frequent or loud snoring , which may stop and start choking , snorting or gasping sounds"
No, waking with a dry mouth or sore throat morning . Headache difficulty concentrating during the day treatment for obstructive sleep apnea may include ordering a device over the mouth at night to help keep the arrows
No," Surgery may be necessary . Anxiety , anxiety disorders are a common mental health condition . A 2015 study from germany found that they affect up to 337 percent of the population ."
No," In addition to causing emotional changes , anxiety can cause physical symptoms . Examples include rapid or shallow , breathing or hyperventilation , so eating rapid heart rate , heart palpitations or"
Environment, bronchospasm or narrowing of the airways that can cause a whizzing noise . Anxiety and stress can also make it more likely . A person will react to allergens which can trigger asthma .
No," Treatment typically involves taking therapy . Treatment typically involves talking therapy , but can also include medications to manage symptoms obesity . Another"
No," potential cause for wheezing is obesity . A randomized study of just over 86 000 adults founded a higher body mass index or bmi , was associated with wheezing , highlight 2019 study found that a higher bmi was associated with fat deposits in the"
Environment," lungs . This may explain why individuals with obesity can experience wheezing as well as other breathing difficulties . People can reach a moderate weight by making dietary changes , doing regular exercise and treating any"
No," underlying conditions that may be contributing to excess weight . Bronchitis . Bronchitis refers to the inflammation of the bronchi , which are the large air"
No," passages inside the lungs in 95 , 95 percent of all cases , acute bronchitis occurs because of a viral infection such as a cold . Bronchitis can also occur due to bacteria allergens or pollutants"
No," such as smokes . The symptoms of acute bronchitis include a productive cough , loud wheezing or difficulty , breathing sore throat , runny nose or other symptoms of a viral infection . Low grade fever"
No," , acute bronchitis , that is caused by a virus , will often get better on its own . The cough may last 10 to 20 days , treatments for bronchitis will vary depending on the cause for viral infections . Doctors typically recommend"
No," rest and treatments that can reduce a cough this . This could include throat losses , hot tea or overthecounter cough medications , gastroesophageal reflux disease or gerd"
No," , difficulty or pain when swallowing regurgitation of food , bad breath , chronic sore throat a recurring or chronic cough wheezing . There is a great risk for"
No," gastroesophageal facial reflux disease to occur in people with asthma . This is because asthma episodes can cause the lower part of the esophagus to relax , allowing stomach acid into the esophagus . Stomach acid can also cause asthma or"
No," copd symptoms such as wheezing , by entering and irritating the airways lifestyle changes , such as avoiding foods that contribute to can reduce gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms . Doctors can also prescribe medications"
No," to reduce stomach acid production , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a condition that progressively makes it more difficult to breathe . The main cause is tobacco smoking , although around 25 percent of cases , are"
No," not linked to smoking . The symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease include chronic productive , cough wheezing , whistling or squi"
No," squeaky squeaky sound when breathing shortness of breath , chest tightness , some people or some people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have different symptoms to these ."
Environment," This include prescribing medications to help open the airways , pulmonary rehabilitation , supplemental oxygen therapy and surgery , heart failure . Heart failure prevents the herd from"
No, pumping enough blood to support organ health and normal breathing . It is a serious condition that can be fatal . The potential symptoms of heart failure include shortness of breath . Persistent cough
Environment," decreased tolerance for exercise , soiling of the limbs and extremities due to fluid overload . Many of these symptoms may not be noticeable until the condition has become advanced . People can reduce the symptoms of heart"
No," failure through medications such as diuretics , beta blockers , ace inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists . Some drugs , as well as devices such as"
No," such as implantable cardio water defibrillators , can prolong a person 's life . How to sleep with wheezing people who experience wheezing when lying down may find it difficult to"
No, sleep to improve quality of sleep . People can try avoiding food before bed . People with gastroesophageal reflux disease should aim to eat at least two to three hours
No," before lying down . This can reduce acid reflux at night , reducing irritation in the esophagus , avoiding caffeine and alcohol . Both caffeine and alcohol make it more likely . A person will experience asthma ."
No," Symptoms . Caffeine can also worsen acid reflux , removing allergens . If a person has asthma or bronchitis caused by allergies , identifying and removing allergens that may be present , while sleeping could help ."
No," For example , if a person allows a pet to sleep on their bed , the dander may cause wheezing at night , trying decongestants overthecounter chest . Decongestants"
No," may help with breathing at night , particularly for people with acute bronchitis . Decongestants may also help people with asthma , though some find that they can make symptoms worse ."
No," Elevating the head , elevating the head neck and shoulders may help to open the airways during sleep , preventing wheezing . It can also reduce acid reflux keeping medications nearby"
No, It is important for people who regularly whiz while lying down to seek medical attention . Doctors can help pinpoint the exact cause of the wheezing and recommend treatments .
No," If someone experiences any of the following symptoms , dial for local emergency department , difficulty , breathing pain in the chest arm neck or jaw , blue or white lips , loss of consciousness or difficulty"
No," There are hundreds of different chronic illnesses and they can be classified into different groups depending on their causes . Symptoms and treatments there 's , for example , cardiovascular diseases , which are chronic illnesses"
No," that affect the heart and blood vessels , including heart failure , stroke and hypertension , also , respiratory diseases , chronic illnesses that affect respiratory system such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma ."
No," health conditions . One of the big struggles for patients with a chronic illness , no matter of which part of the classification is that the treatment is usually symptomatic , but that the illness is not possible to be cured ."
No," burdens . Besides , the actual disease on a patient does include physical symptoms . Chronic illnesses often result in persistent physical symptoms that can be painful , debilitating and interfere with daily activities ."
No," Chronic illnesses also often come with emotional distress . Living with a chronic illness can result in feelings of anxiety , depression , helplessness and stress . Chronic illnesses also often result in increased medical expenses , loss of"
Environment," income due to time off from work or the inability to work and reduced ability to earn a living . Also , some people with chronic illnesses , face stigma and discrimination in their communities at work and in the Health Care system ."
No," Unfortunately , also people with chronic illnesses May face barriers to accessing necessary Medical Care and treatments . Chronic illnesses can also make it difficult to carry out normal daily activities . Chronic illnesses can also place a"
No," managing a chronic illness is to develop a strong Support Network . This can include family members , trans support groups with other patients that have the same disease and Health Care Professionals . Having a network of people who"
No, There are online support groups . Many online forums and social media groups exist for people living with chronic illnesses . This can provide a virtual community of support and a place to connect with others or understand what you are going
No," These can be found through local hospitals , clinics or Community organizations . They offer a chance to connect with others in person and build relationships with people who understand what you are going through ."
No," Healthcare Providers such as doctors , nurses and social workers can be a valuable source of support and information for help groups . They can provide medical advice and connect you with resources and support services in your community ."
No," Also , do n't underestimate the power of the support of friends and family . They can provide emotional support and help with practical tasks such as Transportation or meal preparation . Another crucial aspect of managing a chronic illness is to take an active"
No," role in your own care . This means working with your health care provider to understand your disease , develop a treatment plan , keeping track of your symptoms , and hopefully their Improvement and making lifestyle changes as needed ."
No, Also helpful can be to find a hobby or activity in which one finds joy and distraction from the symptoms of the chronic illness . Adopting healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet targeted at your disease exercising regularly as fitted for the
No, chronic condition and getting enough sleep can help to improve physical and mental wellbeing . Patients are usually also advised to keep a journal of their symptoms . This can be in the form of a notebook on the smartphone in an app or in any other
No," treatments . You are taking and dairy effects on your symptoms record . Your sleep patterns , including the number of hours left and the quality of sleep , keep a record of what you eat and drink each day and any changes in your"
Environment," appetite also note any changes in your mood or energy levels that may be related to your symptoms track . Your physical activity , including the type and duration of exercise and any changes in your ability to carry out"
No," This can include practicing mindfulness journaling , engaging in Creative Pursuits and setting achievable goals seeking out enjoyable activities such as Hobbies , social events and physical activities can also help boost mood and promote a sense of wellbeing ."
No," It is also important to be proactive in managing physical and emotional symptoms . This may involve taking medications as prescribed , seeking out complementary therapies or finding ways to manage pain and discomfort ."
No," Finding effective pharmacological treatment can help to improve the overall quality of life and reduce the impact of the illness on the patient 's daily life . The medications that will be prescribed depend on a chronic illness , but there"
No," are generally a few groups that are likely going to be used . Those are first of all pain , relievers pain , relievers such as acetaminophen , ibuprofen and prescription opioids can help relieve pain associated with chronic conditions of different kinds ."
No," Second , antiinflammatory drugs antiinflammatory drugs , such as corticosteroids , can help to reduce inflammation and swelling associated with certain chronic conditions . Third disease modifying drugs , certain chronic conditions such as"
No," multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis , can be treated with disease modifying drugs which help to slow down the progression of the disease . Fourth , antidepressants and antianxiety drugs , depression and anxiety are common in"
No," people with chronic illnesses , and these conditions can be treated with medications such as antidepressants and antianxiety drugs . Fifth , hormonal Therapies , hormonal therapies , such as insulin for diabetes and thyroid hormone for"
No," hypothyroidism , can help to regulate hormones and manage symptoms of certain chronic conditions and last antibiotics . Chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis and some autoimmune diseases may require longterm treatment with"
No," by developing a strong support network , taking an active role in your care , adopting positive coping strategies and being patient and kind to yourself . You can find ways to thrive . Despite the challenges of chronic illness , that 's it for this video . I hope it was"
Environment," you 're going to be healthy at minimum , you want to be free of dysfunction , have some degree of stress , tolerance to deal with external threats in the environment and have some Degree of repair ability at every level of structural organization . So what are the three"
Environment," environment and its ability to preserve its functional integrity . On the entire stress , recovery continuum is , it is what I referred to as its graded functions , and there are three subcategories to its graded functions and then , lastly , its repair ability , which is its ability to"
No," tumor where the inter independent functions of the cell becomes dysfunctional to such an extent that it starts to divide uncontrollably and it actually starts to do its own thing and therefore it does n't not only preserve its independent functions , but maybe it"
No," Does so , but at the expense of its surrounding tissue forming a tumor ? Now another example , where dysfunction in terms of our integrated functions can take place , is that we all have no the idea that a person can be fit but unhealthy . What they mean by that is is"
Environment," capacity , meaning that it has to be able to deal with stress in such a way that does n't harm the integrated functions of the body , and we basically have three solutions for this . First , is we have the ability to change our internal environment to suit changing external"
No," conditions them as a result of stress , and usually we do that by producing stressor and behavior or through our own work capacity , and then we should be able to recover from that workload Or from that stress after a stressful event , so the graded functions speak to our"
No," , you 'll see , we are at complete rest represented by our resting heart rate , about 60 beats per minute in the middle here . You'Ve got , let 's say the threshold of our general daily physical activity , and we basically live on this in this zone here or what is referred to as our"
Environment," activities of daily living . When we exercise , however , we go from and it 's a a resting heart rate or let 's say an a physical activity resting heart rate of 75 beats when we can push that all the way to 180 . So this is , let 's say , the maximum stress resistance capacity of a"
No," so again you have graded functions at every level of organization dysfunction in this category , because when the structural unit or organism , stress responsiveness or Our work , capacity or recover abilities compromised in in any way so , for instance , when we are"
No," exercising , and you notice a lot of aches and pains either structural or , let 's say more functional - that is an indication of experiencing some degree of decline in these capacities . Okay , moving on to our adaptable functions and the final functional ability category about the"
No," structure , organizations , but also our graded functions . Our acute stress responsiveness , work capacity and our rate of recovery . In fact , if you want to understand how human development works and the rate of human development , you want to understand our adaptable"
Environment," continue many times over . Now it 's important to understand that this is not just happening for exercise . I talked a lot about exercise , but they are in fact dozens of sources of stress and stimuli acting upon the organism and we 're always in one of those three states in"
Environment," stress : they are behavioral natural and social . What does behavioral mean ? Well , the when the organism interacts with the environment , it produces stress through its own behavior , interacting with the environment , and those are our nine primary functions of the human organism"
No," , no sleep without dreams , there 's no perception without sense data , there 's , no thinking without cognition or imagination . There 'S no motion without neurotransmitter there 's , no interaction without people . There 'S no procreation without people , and so again what we 're"
No," psyche , and that can change the way you Thunda mentally think about something and therefore how you approach and act that belief out which has realworld consequences on your own Health and on your own development , so this is why I think these videos are just so important"
No," stress . Just imagine walking down a dog anyway , and you see someone approaching , that is just an immediate source of potential threat and therefore a stress on the body , or we just imagine the social contracts that we have with our spouse or friends and family and the"
No," driving along the freeway and someone pulls you over and you see it 's a you know some representative Authority and your Heart starts racing and you feel , like you , maybe did something wrong and again it 's your perception of authority that , in that mom"
Environment," restoration state as it is applied to exercise , because what we 're looking at here is the stimulus response cycle and it 's going to demonstrate to you the relationship between all the functional abilities that We talked about in each of the functional related categories"
Environment," stress recovery continuum . So if this was sleep and we had just general activity , we stay most of the day between the zone and then this would be exercise , and this would be maximum stress - we 're looking to see how the organism deals with the work demand on the entire continuum here And"
No," and reinforce that damaged tissue and going back into complete baseline . This all basically translate into functional enhancement , which means we could actually see increased work capacity in the next cycle . But this basically demonstrate to us the finish response"
Environment," do n't do it just after it 's done exercise or after it 's been Stressed we want to have it in a fully recovered and ready state to really understand and get accurate , baseline measurements of its functional integrity . So the baseline state is ideal for measuring organisms"
No," state which serves then as a great and functional integrity . Diagnostics as well . But again , the straight state is ideal for measuring the acute responsiveness , work , capacity and recovery ability . In other words , it 's fitness , so if you want to know how fit an organism is or if you"
Environment," that which is highlighted , indicates that the acute stress response parameters on the right happens mostly and can be tracked mostly at the level of The molecule and at the cell , and so obviously as you undergo with stress for example , exercise water temperature"
Environment," increase . The heart rate can may may go from 60 to 120 250 , depending on the intensity of exercise , blood pressure rises , the rate of breathing increases , hormone production is increased and obviously your vo2 max is stressed to its maximum , depending on our again"
Environment," intensity of exercise and the Amount of lactate that you produce is indicative of your acute stress response . Now , the other four health measures are , and perhaps the most important is work capacity , because it 's at the level of doing work that allows us to produce a"
No," speaks to its strength , muscle endurance and its speed . Really it 's just the productive applications of its force , producing capability to do work right . People always talk about 20,000 . You know physical skills and that 's interesting when , when , when measured or evaluated on"
No," its own merits , but really all you have to focus on is improving your power output or your work capacity in a very strategic and safe way and the entire all of the functional abilities That we talked about will improve , of course , in terms of recoverability . The two most"
Environment," what they are , and I 've divided these eight health measures into categories . As you can see , first is the repair response directly following exercise or even hours after exercise , and the second category is what I refer to our reinforcement response or our vital"
Environment," structures which we 'll see in a moment . Now . There are three measures that we can track and based on the repair response to exercise , and that is , we can actually track the degree of damage that the vet , certain cells and tissues experience under stress , because the body will"
No," is another marker of the degree of stress that we just experienced , and so we can usually use things like C reactive , protein and Fri , brenigan and obviously muscle soreness is also a very good subjective , sense of the degree of damage or injury that we may Have"
No," a vegan diet which made the process very easy . For me like mentally and bodily to adapt to it , so that went well and then stayed on a standard . Vegan diet like cooked vegan diet for about six years , and then I found out about a raw vegan diet through"
No," , like a YouTube video . I think I was like , oh that sounds great and I 'm always about like selfexperimentation and yeah , so I gave myself a little more time to transition from a vegan diet to a raw vegan diet . But I had like a lot of like nuts and seeds in the beginning"
No," notice Leon is and more energy for sure and did you notice a big difference being like cooked vegan versus like raw , yes , 100 . Also immensely with just my daily energy that went up like as soon as I transitioned to a more raw diet , but even like being , I would say , like 95 raw"
No, Europe because you were you were raw for a long time ? Would you say like if somebody 's watching and they 're thinking about starting raw now is there anything you feel like you learned that you would do different like other than the thoughts or like any mistakes ? You feel
No," who jump into it and then become unstable after a short amount of time . So I think it 's good to to like go from . Like a standard diet through the vegetarian vegan raw vegan face and then towards more like a foodbased lifestyle , yeah , but then of course you 're you 're"
No," , but uh . The mono diets are amazing . Juice cleansing is amazing . I did uh 70 days on grapes a few years ago , which was like one of the most profound cleansing experiences for myself , where I got rid of a lot of like new cut plaque and parasites and and all of kinds of crazy"
No," successful on the cleanses like feasting and you felt like you had like a lot of positive benefits and it was a really good experience . Oh absolutely , it felt like I said It felt better and better . Every day I had more and more energy , my sinuses cleared up . I was able to like"
No," you see like circles in their Iris and those are called stress or tension Rings , which means that the body holds more stress can also imply that a person is not expressing their emotions in a proper Way , wow , but that mostly goes hand in hand with a poor adrenal"
No," caused by taking a lot of stimulants like coffee energy drinks , even a lot of cacao . Things like that are lowering the adrenal function , because , if you 're taking these stimulants externally , your adrenals are like . Oh , we do n't really have to work here . I have already"
No," for breakfast . But when I wanted to transition to a more raw food diet , I would eat fruit first , because fruit is the easiest to digest . You always want to eat fruit . First , before you go to heavier Foods , because otherwise it will mess up your digestion ."
No," body and that you say like they all go together , so I would love you to expand on that a little bit because I think that 's that 's just really well said how you say : they 're all connected yeah and and Like from my experience and in my opinion , everything starts with a belief"
No," and then that happens through like looking into this world , basically for a period of time , then you form these beliefs , you adopt those and then from those beliefs . Certain thought patterns are formed"
No," positive beliefs and thus think in a better and more positive way , you feel good have all these good emotions . And then your body will release serotonin and all of these like good hormones and"
No," and those are very healing to the body , and is there anything that you do to like make yourself believe and like feel more positive , uh sure you can do different things . In my opinion , meditation is always good to like recalibrate yourself and then"
No, unless you 're like doing maybe like a mono diet for months and you 're kind of like depleting yourself - you do n't want to do that . That 'S why my Approach is more like you want to jump into like a
No," severe the blockages are . So that gives you an indication like how long it will take you to detox , which is very hard to tell even then , because it 's dependent on so many different things like how much you go into the diet ."
No," whites of the eyes too , when you 're like analyzing , someone 's eyes , and you can tell by how bright the whites are if something if they need detoxing ? Yes , definitely , I 'm learning currently learning more about the scleron . For now , I 'm more based more focused on the IRS"
No," think where it 's like this person needs to detox , oh sure like if you look at their skin their fingernails like that yeah , okay . Well , I 'm interested to hear , as you can tell from my excitement at the beginning"
No," supplementing uh like B12 iodine D , any of that type of stuff yeah ? I did in the beginning um because I was reading like about B12 , especially like oh on a vegan diet . You do n't really get that and then I did blood work and it showed like low B12"
No," , I also do coaching on more like mental and emotional level . Amazing , I 'm going to book a consultation with you for the eyes . I 'M so excited awesome , cool , yeah , okay , awesome ! Well , thanks again so much and to the viewers . I hope you guys enjoyed this if it added"
No," some value to your day , give it a big thumbs up , make sure you subscribe . If you do n't already and I 'll catch , you guys , the next video bye"
Environment," with three subcategories that will go Through and define number one being health education , this implies communicating information and coaching people and communities to increase their knowledge to change their mindsets about caring for their health ."
Environment," pyramid . So really , these three factors - health , education , health , screenings and disease prevention - all fall under the umbrella of health promotion , which again is the whole purpose of these health . Behavior theories we 're going to be focusing"
Environment, mostly on health education . Within this video health screenings . We have a separate video coming up shortly in a few weeks on and then disease prevention is one we 've discussed in the previous
No," A theory is a way to explain something that happens , whereas health behavior theories are a bit more specific and they are used to explain why people do what they do relative to their health"
No," Different types of theories exist three to be exact that we 'll go through within this video . One being intrapersonal , two being interpersonal and three being community level theories . What these refer to is intra personal"
No," is within the self . So it 's at the individual level . Interpersonal is person to person , whereas communities at the societal level and the health impact period pictured below"
Environment," The second level is changing the context to make individuals default decisions healthy . The third is longlasting protective interventions . The fourth are clinical interventions , and the top is health , education and"
No," counseling , and now , with this foundation in mind , we 'll go through and define selected health behavior theories , their constructs as well as their limitations . First up is the health belief model ."
No, detection of disease . This has six constructs that will now go through and briefly define and note that the first four constructs were developed as the original tenets of the health belief model . The last two were added as more research
No," Number two is going to be our perceived severity construct , which refers to a person 's subjective belief about the seriousness of developing disease . So , for example , do they think the illness will have severe consequences if they do get"
No," health , behaviors and intentions , including smoking , cessation , drinking cessation , breastfeeding and substance abuse , among others . The theory of planned behavior states that behavioral achievement depends on"
No," This refers to the belief about whether most people approve or disapprove of the behavior , and it relates to a person 's beliefs about whether peers think he or she should engage in the behavior ."
No," briefly . The theory of planned behavior , like the health belief model , also assumes that all people have equal access to medical care where this is not necessarily always true ."
No, This is very important . I 'M going to pull up the initial five stages of change and use the example of smoking cessation to kind of look at these different stages where precontemplation the individual is not aware that smoking is a problem .
No," Next up in the contemplation stage , the individual becomes aware that the smoking behavior is a problem to their health and that they need to change , but they have not made any plan to do so . Yet in the third stage of preparation . This"
No," is where the individual decides to put together an action plan that they can use in the foreseeable future . They will then go into the fourth stage of action where they can quit their habit of smoking , and the last"
Environment," interaction of person , environment and behavior . Number two is behavioral capability . This refers to a person 's actual ability to perform a behavior through essential knowledge and skills . In order to successfully perform a"
Environment," behavior , a person must know what to do and how to do it . People learn from the consequences of their behavior , which also affects the environment in which they live . Number three observational learning . This asserts that people can witness"
Environment," list some limitations of this theory . As in the previous theories we 've seen , this one assumes change in the environment also leads to change in person , which is not always the case right . The whole nature versus nurture argument ."
No," on emotion or motivation . This leads us into our last selected , behavioral theory we 'll go through that acts at the community level . This is known as the diffusion of innovation . This is one of the oldest social science theories ."
No, relative advantage . This is the degree to which an innovation is seen as better than the idea or product . It 'S replacing two being compatibility . How consistent is this innovation in
No, which the values experiences and the needs of the adopters are being met ? Number three complexity . So how difficult is this innovation to understand and or use number four triability ? This is the extent to which the
No," group to bring on board strategies to appeal to them . Include statistics fear , appeals and pressure from other people , and with that said , this is a summary of everything that was discussed in the"
No," Reggae consultant psychiatrist , if you 're new to this channel , we cover all things , Psychiatry and mental health related . So if that 's the thing for you do n't forget to subscribe to , our channel of course hit the notification button as well to be informed of videos as they come up"
No," patients , including social isolation , lack of work and relationships , as well as a high risk of depression and suicide . It is characterized by an over concern with physical appearance , such as an appearance . Ideal becomes the overwhelming and"
No," allpervasive concern . So the appearance ideal is essentially what is the preoccupation . This has to be a certain way and it 's often related to a body part . If there is a small , objectively identifiable cosmetic problem , the bdd"
No," with body dysmorphic disorder attention seeking . Rather they tend to be ashamed , reclusive and have low selfworth . Now , what are the factors that increase the risk of developing or triggering body dysmorphic disorder , now genetics , so having relatives or parents , for example"
No," perfectionism societal pressures or expectations of beauty and , of course , comorbidities such as having another condition such as anxiety or depression . So again , just having this does n't mean that every single person who has this will develop"
No," bdd . But these are some of the risk factors that are present in individuals with PDD , so signs or symptoms of bdd include , firstly , being extremely preoccupied with a perceived flaw and appearance that , to others ca n't be seen or appears minor , so I 've had patients"
No," , for example , being very , Very concerned about their nose being too big or , for example , a gap between their eyebrows , so lots of these different things related to lips , for example , cheeks ears , Etc . Strong belief that you have a defect in your appearance that makes you ugly or"
No," deformed belief that others take special notice of your appearance in a negative way or Mock You engaging in behaviors , aimed at fixing or hiding the perceived flow that are difficult to resist or Control such as frequently checking the mirror , grooming or skin . Picking , if you"
No," similarity sort of occurs , attempting to hide perceived flaws with styling makeup or clothes , and sometimes individuals can spend a long time in order to do that constantly come comparing your appearance with others can result in low selfesteem and can result in depression ."
No," Frequently , seeking reassurance about your appearance from others having perfectionistic Tendencies , seeking cosmetic procedures with little satisfaction and avoiding social situations as a result . So these are some of the signs and symptoms of bdd . If"
No," aspects as well thoughts , feelings and behaviors . Then we have personal social , family , medical history and then symptoms in the DSM . So what are the DSM criteria for bdd ? So first , as I mentioned , is a preoccupation with one or more perceived effects or flaws in physical appearance"
No," constantly comparing his or her appearance with that of others , and it causes significant distress or impairment in Social occupational functioning and the preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with Body , fat or"
No," process is very , very different . We have body image disturbance in anorexia , but anorexia tends to have other symptoms here you can see it 's a preoccupation of one or more perceived effects of flaws , and then you have sort of checking behaviors associated with it . But it 's"
No," not explained by concerns with body fat or weight . Okay , so that 's how you differentiate between the Eating Disorders . They can coexist by the way , so it 's not exclusive . So how is body dysmorphic disorder treated now ? The treatment is actually quite"
No," response of checking , for example , or skin , picking or other things . And then , as you can see , there is a cognitive component , such as challenging automatic negative thoughts about one 's body , image and learning more flexible ways of thinking and the therapist . You know yourself or"
No," patient in the psychotherapist , can talk about goals for therapy and develop a personalized treatment plan medication now , because bdd is thought to be , there is an association related to you know , serotonin in a certain way . Therefore , we do find that ssris , just like high doses"
Environment," , are the prescribed for OCD . The same aspect applies here . The combination tends to work better than one or the other and , of course , Family Support is also important , because family psycho education to understand body , dysmorphity , signs and symptoms are important . It 'S"
No," course , becomes really important for the range of cosmetic surgeons plastic surgeons to to rule out disorders like this as well , and sometimes engage with Psychiatry Mental Health Specialists to ensure that this does n't lead to more harm . Constructive surgery , says gen. Z is"
No," them and you have to be so careful that is n't the issue , because that 's more of a mental health issue . So I hope that this has given you a good understanding of bdd body , dysmorphic disorder . Thank you so so much for watching and supporting this channel . If you liked leave us a"
No," When Lauren was fifteen years old, her family moved across the country and she started going to a new school. Already shy, Lauren suffered from low selfconfidence and had a hard time transitioning; nothing felt right and soon her changing body became a source of insecurity. Eventually, she began thinking that maybe if she lost weight and focused on fitness, she'd make more friends and feel better about herself and life would get better. Soon she became obsessed with dieting and it quickly spiraled into her subsisting only on rice cakes and apples and candy corn and celery."
No," She like this new feeling of control every time she stood on the scale and saw a lower number. She was achieving something, and that made her feel good. Soon, she thought of nothing else. But what Lauren couldn't see was that she was no longer healthy. Even when her hair started falling out and her skin grew dry and cracked, and when she could never get warm. When she looked in the mirror, she still saw a chubby girl. Her family, though, did notice, and yet, at a visit to the doctor, she was just told to eat more. She didn't."
No," One day while jogging, she had a heart attack and collapsed. As a teenager, she was 5'7"" and weighed eightytwo pounds. Lauren was finally admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she was treated for anorexia nervosa. She was put on bed rest, saw a therapist twice a week, joined a support group and slowly began eating small amounts of food again. Her recovery was slow but, with the support of her family and doctors, she was released eight months later. Though Lauren suffered a few relapses over the years, she is now healthy. Ultimately, she was lucky. Anorexia, bulimia, and other eating and body dysmorphic disorders can kill."
No," boys have used troubling weight control methods like fasting, skipping meals, smoking, vomiting, or taking laxatives. The rate of new cases of eating disorders in Western culture has been increasing since the 1950's, and today in the US, an estimated twenty million women and ten million men have suffered from a clinically significant eating disorder at some point in their lives. But get this straight: we're not talking about fad diets or lifestyle choices spurred by vanity. Eating disorders are psychological illnesses that often come with serious consequences."
Environment," These disorders tend to fall into three main categories: anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorders. Those suffering from anorexia nervosa, most often adolescent females, essentially maintain a starving diet and, eventually, and abnormally low body weight. As in Lauren's case, anorexia can begin as a diet that quickly spirals out of control as a person becomes obsessed with continued weight loss, all while still feeling overweight. Our old friend, the DSM V, actually delineates two sub types of the disorder. The first involves restriction, which usually consists of an extremely lowcalorie diet, excessive exercise,"
No," or purging, like vomiting or the use of laxatives. The second type is the binge/purge sub type, which involves episodes of binge eating combined with the restriction behavior. As you can easily imagine, the physiological effects of this psychological condition can be devastating. As the body is denied crucial nutrients, it slows down to conserve what little energy it has, often resulting in abnormally slow heart rate, loss of bone density, fatigue, muscle weakness, hair loss, severe dehydration, and an extremely low body mass index. And it's that low body mass that's the defining characteristic of anorexia nervosa a refusal"
No," to maintain a weight at or above what would normally be considered minimally healthy. If this condition persists, of course, it can be deadly, which is why anorexia has what's often estimated to be the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. That might surprise you, given the host of troubling disorders we've already covered here on Crash Course Psychology, but mortality rates associated with, say, major depression or PTSD or schizophrenia tend to be the result of secondary behavior, like suicide. But with anorexia, the mortality rate is especially high because people can die as a direct result"
No," or guilt, but without purging or fasting. Although sometimes triggered by stress or a need for, or lack of, control, the presence of an eating disorder is not a telltale sign of childhood sexual abuse, as was once commonly thought. Instead, these disorders are often predictive indicators of a person's feelings of low selfworth, need to be perfect, falling short of expectations, and concern with others perceptions. Although the prevalence of bulimia and bingeeating is similar among ethnic groups in the United States, anorexia is is much more common among white women, often of higher socioeconomic status."
No," often obsess over their appearance, often staring into mirrors for hours, and feel distressed or ashamed by what they see. Although it's often lumped in with the eating disorders, our growing understanding of body dysmorphia suggests that it actually shares some traits with obsessivecompulsive disorder, particularly the obsession with some imagined bodily perfection and the compulsion to check oneself over and over to discern perceived flaws. Not surprisingly, BDD and OCD may share some similar neurophysiological features, although"
Environment," that's still being researched. People suffering from BDD may exercise excessively, groom themselves excessively, or seek out extreme cosmetic procedures, but, unless treated, they usually remain critical and unsatisfied with their looks, to the point of fearing that they have a deformity. People with BDD may suffer from anxiety and depression, start avoiding social situations, and stay home for fear that others will notice and judge their appearance negatively. Obviously, this causes a lot of emotional distress and dysfunction. Some bodybuilders"
No," Neurologically, there are a few compelling clues. In the case of eating disorders, for example, research has long suggested that neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine may play a role. Dopamine is involved in regions of the brain connected to hunger and eating, like the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, and some research has found that binge eating appears to alter the regulation of dopamine production in a way that can reinforce further binging. The result is a neurological pattern that can resemble drug addiction, although the"
No," addiction comparison is still pretty controversial. Genetics appear to play a role, too, as there seems to be increased risk among genetic relatives with eating disorders as compared to controls. But a lot of attention is also being paid to environmental and familial factors, particularly the behavioral modeling and learning processes that shape how we think about ourselves and our bodies. Specifically, children who grow up observing problematic or unhealthy eating behavior in parents may be at higher risk for developing an eating disorder. And explicitly"
Environment," learning unreasonable or unhealthy values about your weight or your shape from your family, and definitely from your peers, can have a powerful effect. Eating and body dysmorphic disorders are serious business, but they are treatable and perhaps even preventable. If cultural learning contributes to how we eat and how we want to look, then maybe education can help increase our acceptance of our own appearance, and be more accepting of others. Today, you learned about the symptoms and sub types of anorexia, bulimia, and bingeeating"
Environment," our biology reacts to things like what we eat or stress or exercise. Indeed, as you will soon learn from my discussion with Dr. Crum, what you believe about the nutritional content of your food changes the way that food impacts your brain and body to a remarkable degree."
Environment," And the same is true for mindsets about exercise and stress, and even medication. For instance, recent work from Dr. Crum's laboratory shows, that what we believe about the side effect profiles of different drug treatments or different behavioral treatments, has a profound impact on how quickly those treatments work"
No," and the effectiveness of those treatments. I just want to mention one particular study that just came out from a graduate student in Dr. Crum's laboratory, Lauren Howe, HOWE, showed that, how kids react to a treatment for peanut allergies, can be profoundly shaped by whether or not those kids were educated"
No," about the side effects of the treatment, such that if they learned that the side effects were a byproduct of a treatment that would help them. And they learned a little bit about why those side effects arose and that the side effects might even help them in route to overcoming their peanut allergy,"
No," had an enormous impact on how quickly they move through the treatment and indeed how much they suffered or in this case did not suffer from those side effects. And that is, but one example that you will learn about today as we discuss what mindsets are, the number of different mindsets that exist,"
Environment," So for instance, ask yourself, what is my mindset about stress? What is my mindset about food? What is my mindset about exercise? What is my mindset about relationships of different kinds? Because in doing that, you'll be in a great position to extract the best of the information"
No," The term nootropic means smart drug, and it is not a term that I like because there is no such thing as a universally useful smart drug. The reason for that, is that our brain can be creative. We can be focused, we can be good at task switching. And each of those different things,"
No," and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been a total game changer. I love the motivation formula, I also like the energy formula. I use those for different things, it turns out, but I love those. And I use their logic formula and their clarity formula"
Environment," of the visual system in mind, so that you always see things with crystal clarity, no matter what environment you're in. They also have a terrific aesthetic. They have many, many different styles to choose from. So their eyeglasses can be worn to dinner, or out to lunch or to work."
Environment," They have a personalized dashboard that allows you to, of course, see the numbers that come back to you and to make various changes in nutrition, various changes in exercise, various changes in all sorts of lifestyle factors, that can bring those numbers into range."
No," And so, if you have a particular value for a particular metabolic factor or hormone or so forth, you click on that, and it will actually bring up the full menu of things that you can do in order to adjust that factor into the ranges that you like, all based on quality peer reviewed research."
No," on the science of mindsets. Could you define for us what is a mindset, and what sort of purpose does it serve. Of course, yeah. Mindsets have been described or defined in a lot of ways. We define mindsets as core beliefs or assumptions that we have"
No," The nature of stress. What's your sort of core belief about that? And mindsets that we've studied about stress, or do you view stresses enhancing good for you, or do you view it as debilitating and bad for you? Those mindsets, those core beliefs, orient our thinking, they change what we expect will happen to us"
No," as Carol Dweck's work has shown. Mindsets about food, mindsets about medicine, you name it. It's sort of distilling down those core assumptions that really shape and orient our thinking in action. I've heard you say before, that mindsets simplify life in some way, by constraining the number of things"
No," in your own science or your own life. Yeah, sure, so I think it's important with Carol Dweck's work. A lot of people kind of get focused on growth, motivation and all these things, but her work really originated from thinking about, what she called as implicit theories"
No," or core beliefs about the nature of intelligence or ability, right? So do you believe that your baseline levels of intelligence or your abilities, are fixed, static, set throughout the rest of your life? Or do you believe that they can grow and change? Now, those are oversimplified generalizations"
No," they help us to simplify this complex reality, but they're not in consequential, right? They matter in shaping our motivation. And as she has shown, if you have the mindset, that intelligence is malleable, you're motivated to work harder, to grow your intelligence. If you have a setback in your learning, you think,"
Environment," Mindsets about exercise, do you feel like you're getting enough, or do you feel like you're getting an insufficient amount to get the health benefits you're seeking. Mindsets about illness. Do you view cancer as an unmitigated catastrophe, or do you view cancer as manageable"
No," or perhaps even an opportunity. We've looked at mindsets about symptoms and side effects. Do you view side effects as a sign that the treatment is harmful, or do you view side effects as a sign that the treatment is working? Again, these are sort of core beliefs"
No," or assumptions you have about these domains or categories, but they matter because they're shaping, they're synthesizing and simplifying the way we're thinking, but they're also shaping what we're paying attention to, what we're motivated to do, and potentially even how our bodies respond. Yeah, I'd love to talk about this notion"
Environment," on food and obesity. And I had come in doing some previous work on mindsets about exercise and placebo effects in exercise, and was in this sort of food domain and this emotions and food domain. And it really occurred to me, that there was a very simple question"
No," that hadn't been probed yet. And that was, do our beliefs about what we're eating change our body's physiological response to that food, holding constant, the objective nutrients of that thing. So that question might sound outrageous at first, but it's really not outrageous if you're coming from a place"
No," of having studied in depth, placebo effects. Placebo effects, in medicine, at least, are these sort of a robust demonstration in which simply taking a sugar pill, taking nothing, under the impression that it's a real medication that might relieve your asthma, reduce your blood pressure and boost your immune system,"
No," can lead to those physiological effects even though there's no objective nutrients. And we have more evidence on placebo effects than we have for any other drug. Really? Because of the clinical trial process, in which all new drugs and medications are required"
No," to outperform a placebo effect. So we have a lot of data on the placebo effect. Now, you know, we can get nuance there. We don't have a lot of data comparing the placebo effect to doing nothing, which is important for distilling mindset effects or belief effects from sort of natural occurring changes in the body."
Environment," But anyways, going back to this question, it was like, all right, we've moved from medications solving our health crisis to behavioral medicine solving our health crisis, increase people's exercise, get them to eat better. To what degree are these things influenced by our mindsets or beliefs about them."
No," So to test this question, we ran a seemingly simple study. This was done at the Yale center for clinical and translational research. And we brought people into our lab under the impression that we were designing different milkshakes with vastly different metabolic concentrations, nutrient concentrations,"
No," The other time point, they were told that it was a low fat, low calorie, sensible sort of diet shake. In reality, it was the exact same shake. It was right in the middle. It was like 300 calories, moderate amount of fats and sugars. And we were measuring their body's gut peptide response"
No," And especially for me, this was one study that really transformed the way I think about how I approach eating. And that was the manner in which it affected our physiology, was somewhat counterintuitive. So, I had gone in thinking, the better mindset to be in when you eat"
No," is that you're eating healthy, right? Like, you know, just makes sense. Like placebo effects think you're healthy, you'll be healthy, you know. But that was a far too simplistic way of thinking about it. And in fact, it was the exact opposite because thinking that they were eating,"
No," so I'm involved in online discussions and social media, in one of the most barbed wire topics out there, and that's being generous, is this topic of which diet or nutrients are best? You've got people who are strictly plantbased, you've got people who are omnivores, you got people who are carnivores."
No," You have every variation. You have intermittent fasting, also called time restricted feeding. And it seems like, once a group and it plugs into a particular mode of eating that they feel works for them, for whatever reason, energy wise, mentally,"
No," that they feel brings them the most enrichment of life, but also nutrients. And that their health really is shifting in a positive direction, but not necessarily because of the food constituents, but because of the community, and the ideas and the reinforcement."
No," Yeah, and the belief that this is the right way of doing something. I think, a hundred percent it has something to contribute. I'm not going to weigh in on the debate. What I will most certainly weigh in on, is the notion that, look going back to the placebo effect, right?"
No," We have a outdated understanding of what that is, which is based on this randomized controlled trial, you compare a drug to a placebo. If the drug works better than the placebo, you say, great, the drug works. If the drug doesn't outperform the placebo, you say the drug doesn't work."
No," That's really over simplified. It's a good test for the specific efficacy of the drug. It's not a good test for understanding the total impact of that drug. Because in the reality of things, if a drug outperforms a placebo, then you start prescribing it."
No," But the reality is, that the total effect of that drug, is a combined product of the specific chemical attributes of that drug and whatever's going on in the placebo effect, which is, at least from our perspective, its beliefs, its social context, and it's your body's natural ability"
No," to respond to something. So, that's in the placebo effect example. The same is true for everything we do or consume. So when it comes to what diet you're eating, both are true. It does matter what it is and it matters what you think about that diet"
No," and what others around you in our culture think about that diet. Because those social contexts inform our mindsets, our mindsets interact with our physiology in ways that produce outcomes that are really important. So let's not get dualistic and say, it's either all in the mind or not in the mind."
No," Let's also not be unnecessarily combative and say, oh, it should be all plantbased or keto or whatever. It's all of those things are a combined product of what you're actually doing, and what you're thinking about. If you believe in it, if you don't, if you're skeptical,"
No," or in some cases, you think you should be eating a certain way and then you don't live up to that. It might have even an adverse effect because of the stress and the anxiety associated with that. Very interesting. Along the lines of belief effects,"
No," could we call these belief effects or mindsets? Sure, yeah. Is there a difference between these what I'm calling belief effects and placebo effects? I mean, are placebo effects distinctly different from mindset effects or they more or less the same thing."
No," They're related? So I think placebo effects, maybe should be reserved for the conditions in which you're actually taking a placebo, which is inactive substance. When you get out of that sort of placebo versus drug realm, and you start looking at placebo effects,"
No," are made up of three things. It's the social context, mindsets or beliefs, and the natural physiological processes in the brain and body that can produce the outcomes. And so, we could just call them belief effects because the beliefs are triggering the physiological processes,"
No," and the beliefs are shaped by the social context. Does that make sense? It makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, there was a paper a year or two ago published in science magazine about brain regions involved in psychogenic fever. That if people or you can actually do this"
No," So, I'm a believer in belief effects. Just say that, you know, the term that we use in our field is nocebo effect for that, which is sort of the placebo's ugly stepsister. It's when negative beliefs cause negative consequences. So, you are told you will have"
No," it's also that your attention changes. So we're experiencing things like fatigue and headache and upset stomach all the time. And then when you take a drug and somebody says, you're going to feel fatigue and headache, you start noticing that you're tired, and that headaches attributed to the drug."
No," Ellen Langer is a professor of psychology at Harvard, and she's done a lot of really fascinating work on her flavor of mindfulness, which is distinct from a more Eastern mind, Buddhist sort of mindfulnessbased work. She actually was the one who said to me originally, you know, I was an athlete at the time."
Environment," I was an ice hockey player and I was training constantly. And one day I'll never forget it. She said, you know the benefit of exercise is just a placebo, right? And I was like, well, that's outrageous. Ellen's known for saying very provocative, but also very wise things."
Environment," And that statement really got me thinking about that. So we designed this study together and that was to look at, how would you study? If the benefits of exercise were a placebo, how would you even test that? Because, what does it mean to give a placebo exercise? So we sort of flipped it on its head."
Environment," And we found a group of people who were getting a lot of exercise, but weren't aware of it, that they were, right? So this, we settled on a group of hotel housekeepers. So these are women working in hotels who were on their feet all day long, pushing carts, changing linens, climbing stairs,"
Environment," Hey, how much exercise do you think you're getting? A third of them said, zero. I don't get any exercise. And the average response was like a three, on a scale of zero to 10. So it's clear that even though these women were active, they didn't have that mindset, right?"
Environment," They had the mindset that their work was just work. Hard, maybe thankless work that led them to feel tired and in pain at the end of the day. But not that it was good for them, that it was good exercise. So what we did was we took these women and we randomized them into two groups,"
Environment," and we told half of them that their work was good exercise. In this case, it was true factual information. We oriented them to the surgeon General's guidelines. We oriented them to the benefits that they should be receiving. And then we had measured them previously, on their physiological metrics, like weight and body fat"
No," in between cleaning hotel rooms, as far as I'm concerned. They didn't report any changes in their diet, but they had benefits to their health. So they lost weight. They decreased their systolic blood pressure by about 10 points on average. And they started feeling better about themselves,"
Environment," their bodies and their work, not surprisingly. That's amazing. How do we conceptualize that result in light of all of our efforts to get more out of exercise, right? Because earlier you mentioned it from the milkshake study and our perceptions about nutrient density,"
Environment," when you think something is nutrient dense and can actually suppress hunger more. So, in light of this result, if I were to say, okay, my current understanding of the literature is that getting somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes per week of cardiovascular exercise"
Environment," Is that right? Definitely. So this is a really important point, because what this reveals is that we have to be more thoughtful in how we go about motivating people to exercise or teaching people about the benefits."
Environment," Our current approach is just to basically tell people, writ large, here's what you need to get. Here's what you need to get good for. To get enough exercise to receive the health benefit. The problem with that approach is that, most people aren't meeting those benefits yet, they aren't meeting those requirements yet."
Environment," And the risk with that is that, well, the intention with that is to motivate them because public health officials think, well, if I just tell people you need to get more exercise because it's good for you, they'll do it. We know now that that doesn't work, that these guidelines are not motivational."
Environment," I'm not saying that mindset is everything. Certainly exercise is good for us and is helpful for us. It's one of the things we have the best data on. So I'm not saying, oh, exercises all a placebo. What I am saying is that, we need to be more mindful about how do we motivate people to exercise, but how do we help people"
Environment," to actually reap the benefits of the exercise they are already doing? Now, Octavia, who is a grad student in my lab, ran a number of interesting studies along these lines. One in which she looked at three nationally representative data sets, which had this interesting question in them,"
Environment," which was how much exercise do you get relative to others? Do you get about the same, a little more, a lot more, do you get a little less or a lot less, right? So, the audience, your listeners, you could all answer this. And then in these datasets, what she did, was she had pulled from data that tracked death rates"
Environment," over the next 21 years. And a couple interesting things revealed themselves. One was that, the correlations between these perceptions of exercise relative to others, and people's actual exercise as measured through accelerometer data, as well as more rigorous sort of what did you do today,"
No," everything's relative, right? I used to do triathlons very seriously. So if you were to ask me now, I feel like I'm totally inactive, right? Because I'm not doing anything near what I used to. And if that's my focus set, right? I feel like I'm not exercising much."
Environment," We were training all the time. And I was in an unhealthy mindset about that, I never felt like I was getting enough. I would come off a two hour practice into a weightlifting session. And then I would get on the elliptical for 30 minutes, 'cause I thought I had to do that also."
Environment," to feel like they're getting enough? It's a sense of enoughness that really matters. Yeah, I can see the dilemma because you don't want people thinking that exercise and its positive effects are so potent that they can get away with a three minute walk each day. And that they're good because most likely they are not."
Environment," But again, you don't want them to be so back on their heels psychologically that they don't even do that or that they never exceed that by very much. But it seems like the message from the milkshake study and what we're talking about now in terms of exercise would be to really communicate to the general public"
Environment," that food has a potency, even healthy foods have a potency to give us energy, to fuel our immune system and endocrine system, et cetera. And that exercise has a remarkable potency, and that that potency can be enhanced by believing in or understanding that potency. Exactly."
Environment," Both exercise and what you think about it matter. Both what you eat and how you think about what you eat matter. And so, we really, as individuals and as a society need to work on, what is the right way to cultivate both behaviors and mindsets about those behaviors that serve us?"
No," And in the food context, this Again, that milkshake study really changed me on a personal level, because I had been somebody who was constantly trying to restrain my eating, right? I wanted to maintain or lose weight, look fit. And so, I was like, well, I should diet"
No," and I should have low calorie, low carb. Low this, low that. But what that was doing, was putting me into this constant mindset of restraint. And what that study suggested, was that that mindset was potentially counteracting any benefit or any objective effects of the restrained diet."
No," And I'm excited that the potency of mindsets are coming through again and again. So, I have a question about this. I don't know if this study has ever been done, but a lot of these mindset effects are something that years ago, I felt I did visavis sleep."
No," Because I was in graduate school, and as a postdoc, and even as an undergraduate, I had so much work to do that I decided I would sleep when I was ""dead"". Not a good idea from what we know. However, I found that a couple nights of minimal sleep or even an allnighter and I could do pretty well. Eventually it would catch up with me."
No," Has there ever been a study exploring whether or not the effects of sleep deprivation can be impacted by these mindset effects? Because over the years, I keep learning more and more about how much sleep I need and I've really emphasized it, but I do feel much better when I'm getting it. But as new parents know,"
No," or students know or athletes know or anyone that lives a normal life find sometimes that they don't get a good night's sleep. Would believing that we can tolerate that and push through it and function just fine, and that it's not going to kill us or give us Alzheimer's. Could that help us deal with a poor night's sleep"
No," or even two or chronic sleep deprivation? Certainly I would guess. There's been one study to my knowledge that's tested that. [indistinct] and colleagues, and they looked at They had people come in and they gave them sort of a, I think it was a sham sort of EEG test to figure out how"
No," This was done a number of years ago. Now we actually have devices to test this, but there's was this sham test. And then they gave people fake feedback about the quality of their sleep and how it had been the night before. And they also asked the participants"
No," how they felt about their sleep. And essentially what they found was that this sham feedback, if they were told that they had gotten and let lower quality sleep led to deficits in variety of cognitive tasks. And that was sort of decoupled from their actual [laughs] qualities of sleep,"
No," at least as selfreported. So that's one study that attest to this, I think certainly, I would bet a lot of money, I haven't run those myself, but that your mindsets can push around your cognitive functioning, physiological effects of sleep. But once again, it's not all or nothing, right? There are real important benefits of sleep,"
No," and how far we can push around that through our mindset, is an open question. You know what? The result that you mentioned is really interesting because a lot of people use these sleep trackers now. They're using rings or wristbands. In fact, my lab has worked pretty closely"
No," with a company that they supplied us data on how well people are sleeping, and you get a score, people get the score back. When they see that score, they might think based on these results, oh, my recovery score, my sleep score is poor. I shouldn't expect much from myself today,"
No," or it makes sense that my memory would be going. For this reason, and I'll probably lose a few friends for saying this, but hopefully I'll gain a few as well. That's why I like to just do a subjective score for myself. If I wake up in the morning, I just decide, okay, did I sleep well or not?"
No," I don't like seeing a number. I don't like getting a readout from a device. That's me, I know a lot of people like it, and they can be very useful. But gosh, it seems that these belief effects are weaving in at all levels. I'd love for us to talk about stress,"
Environment," in ways that would make it serve us better as opposed to harm us and our mental and physical performance. Great, yeah, so I'd come off the heels of doing some research in exercise and diet and finding these provocative and also counterintuitive effects"
No," with respect to how we should try to motivate people, right? And, as I was thinking about this, and this grouping of going from medicines to saving us to behaviors to saving us, and how those behaviors might be influenced by mindsets. The obvious next thing to think about with stress, right? Because it's like, okay,"
Environment," well you want to be healthier and fix your diet, fix your exercise and stress less. And so I started doing some digging into the nature of stress and a couple things were clear. One was that the public health message was very clear, right?"
No," could lead not to destruction, but in fact, to the exact opposite, to an enhanced sense of connection with our values, connection to others, sense of joy and passion for living. And so, I found that to be interesting. And my work since then has been not to try to argue that stress is enhancing and not debilitating,"
Environment," So these employees were stressed about being laid off. They were taking on more pressure. It was just a tough time. And we randomized them into three conditions. And this was all prework before getting training on stress, but the three different conditions, some watched no videos, some watched the stressful crushy videos"
No," So people who watched the enhancing films had fewer backaches, muscle tension, insomnia, racing heart, and so forth. And they also reported performing better at work compared to those who watched the debilitating videos. Now interestingly, we didn't make anyone worse with the debilitating videos."
No," I love that study, and I know we both have friends and ties in the special operations community through just sort of happenstance and maybe we'll get into that a little later, but a good friend from that community always says, there are only three ways to go through life at any moment,"
Environment," And I know that you've actually looked at that community and it does really seem like that's a mindset that either they have going in or that they cultivate through the course of their training. But this notion that stress is what puts us in forward motion, is true physiologically, right?"
Environment," I'm trying to get the message out there. Except for this group of Navy SEALs. When they were actually recruit, so people who were going through basic training in order to become Navy SEALs. And we found that they on average had stresses enhancing mindset,"
Environment," perhaps not surprisingly, right? If you're going in to devote your whole life to being a Navy SEAL, you must have some inclination that stress is a source of strength for you. But what we found with them, we measured this at the beginning of their basic training,"
Environment," of buds training, and then looked at how well they succeeded through that program. So as you know, this is an extremely rigorous program. At the time it was only like 10 or 20% of trainees. Still is, the numbers have never shifted from about that. No matter how hard pressures on the community change,"
Environment," the numbers are still about on average, about 15%. Yeah, wow. So, what we found was that our measure predicted that rate. So people even within that range had a more stresses enhancing mindset were more likely to complete training, become a SEAL. They also had faster obstacle course times,"
No," If you have a stressors enhancing mindset, the motivation changes, right? Then the motivation is, how do I utilize the stress to realize the enhancing outcomes? What can we do here, right? To learn from this experience, to make us stronger, fitter, have better science and treatments for the future,"
Environment," who runs the UFC Performance Training Institute, his name is Duncan French. And his graduate work at Yukon stores was very interesting. It was in exercise science and physiology. What he showed was that, if you could spike the adrenaline response... I think they did this through first time skydive"
No," that could readily explain them. Yeah, and I think figuring out exactly how it works is really, [chuckles]. We should do that. We should do that. We should collaborate. Let's do it. We've got common friends in both departments, so we should do it."
No," For your listeners, they're now invited to bring their stress mindsets up to the consciousness and say, what is my stress mindset? How am I thinking about stress? Can I reprogram that? Can I start to think about it as more enhancing? That takes a little bit of a conscious work potentially,"
No," that we're going to experience? I'm not saying go out and seek out more stress. What I am saying is that, you're going to experience stress if you have any cares or values or passions and most all of us do. And so, then what do you do? And we've developed a threestep approach"
No," is something you care about. So you're using it as an opportunity to reconnect to what is it that I care about here? And then the third step is to utilize the stress response, to achieve the thing that you care about, not spend your time, money, effort, energy, trying to get rid of the stress."
No," and leveraging that power. I think what I like so much about that framework is that the stress response is very generic. Unlike the relaxation response, we don't actually have to train up the stress response. So we all kind of get this as a freebie. And then it sounds like it's a question"
No," which then over exacerbates it, or they check out from the stress, which leads to depression and anhedonia. Because by checking out from stress, you're also checking out from the things we care about. And substance abuse. Exactly. Our colleague Anna Lembke, who also we had"
No," Third is influential others. So what doctors say to us or close friends or peers. And fourth is your conscious choice. So, we talked about that a little. We have as humans have the ability to be mindful of, and to change our mindsets. But the social media and influencer stuff"
No," to show that the ways people are talking about the foods they're eating really matter too. So generally what we've found is that when people talk about unhealthy foods, they use a language that connotes a sense of excitement, fun, sexiness, danger, indulgence, basically anything good and desirable, right?"
Environment," not a health influencer per se, but a celebrity influencer because they'll get paid, right? It's part of the ecosystem that allows them an income and it feeds back on sales to the company. Whereas things that can't be commoditized, it's more difficult, right? It's hard to the whoever makes oranges and sells oranges"
No," or branded content. There was some of that certainly, and yeah, all of the promoted and branded content is usually for processed high sugar foods. But 90% or more of these foods that they were showing were not promoted or branded. And so, there's a lot of flexibility"
No," by the way, is what are you most excited about lately? What are you up late thinking about and getting up early thinking about? Yeah, so hands down, the thing I'm most [mumbles], well, I guess there's so many things. The thing that I'm most into right now, we're doing the most work in is, you know,"
No, I started by getting inspired by placebo effects in medicine. I did a long stint in placebo or belief like effects in behavioral health. And now we're moving back into medicine. So I'm really interested in looking at how we can work with active drugs
No," and treatments, to make them better and make the experience of them better by instilling different mindsets. So, one study we did along those lines, we worked with kids or undergoing treatment for food allergies. So allergies to peanuts, for example,"
No," this was with Kari Nadeau, who's the head of the Stanford Allergy Center here. She has a great treatment for food allergies. Basically kids take gradually increasing doses of the thing they're allergic to, like peanuts. And over the course of six or seven months, these kids become less reactive to peanuts."
No," And the problem with that treatment is it's really difficult because they're having all sorts of negative symptoms and side effects. These kids are getting itchy mouths and upset stomach, they're puking and it's scary, because they're literally eating the thing that they've been told might kill them, right?"
No," And what we did in the study, was we attempted to improve the experience and outcomes of that, by reframing mindsets about the symptoms and the side effects. So as it was being conducted before, the kids were told, look, these side effects are just an unfortunate byproduct of this treatment,"
No," and you have to sort of endure them to get through it. But what we found in our conversation with Kari, was that the reality of those side effects was not so negative. In fact, they were mechanistically linked to the body learning how to tolerate peanuts or the allergen."
No," And so what we did was we worked within a trial. They were all getting the treatment, but half of them were helped to see this more positive mindsets. That symptoms and side effects from this treatment, were a positive signal that the treatment was working and their bodies were getting stronger."
No," And what we found was that that mindset led to reductions in anxiety, fewer symptoms, when at the highest doses and most interestingly of all, they had better outcomes. So based on immune markers, that were assign of the allergic tolerance, those who had this mindset throughout"
No," had better outcomes to the treatment. So that's just one example. I think, my goal is really to move us beyond the placebo versus drug, mindset versus behavior, to get to a place where we can blend them together and maximize the benefit of these treatments. So we're doing a lot of studies like that,"
No," you know, how can we improve treatment for cancer with different mindsets? We've done some work recently with the COVID19 vaccine, and symptoms and side effects. So that's what I'm really passionate about right now. It's incredible. I can't wait to read that study."
No," and that we can hear it direct from the person who ran the study. I find this issue of side effects really interesting. I don't take a lot of prescription drugs, but recently I was prescribed a few, and the list of side effects is, it's incredible and it just goes on and on and on."
No," and you are told again and again, how effective it is for that treatment, that it could amplify the effect. So in other words, it's strictly a placebo. It's not nocebo, as you described before. But that perhaps at a lower dose, a given medication could have a amplified effect"
No," through which blood pressure could be relieved. Maybe it's anxiety reduction, maybe it's changing the sort of anticipation of what are the prioritization of what the body needs to focus on. And so, I really think that, the work of the future needs to be on getting more sophisticated about"
No," And that is, how do we consciously and deliberately change our mindsets? And the first step is really simple, and that's just to be aware that you have them. That the world, your beliefs, aren't sort of an unmitigated reflection of reality as it objectively is."
No," like the kids with allergies who are getting treatment, they didn't have any other mindsets about symptoms. So we just had the luxury of setting it, right? When it comes to healthy food, I think it's harder to change people's mindsets because we have a lot of baggage weighing us down. As a parent, for me,"
No," I guess my number one piece of advice is to lighten up, trying to get your kids to do certain things and focus more on helping them to adopt more adaptive mindsets. So, I'm by no means an expert at this, but I'm testing it with my own child. Your child real, real child."
No," The real kind of experiment. It's how do I resist the urge to force my child to eat her dinner so that she can have her dessert, right? Because that's the real urge. It's like, no, you need Or you're negotiating. to do that."
No," Because when you start thinking about it in terms of mindset, you realize, oh, that's just reinforcing to her, that the dessert is the exciting, fun thing to have. And this thing that I have to do must be horrible. So horrible that my parent is forcing me to do it, right? So it's letting go a little bit of the behavior,"
No," the objective reality, and really thinking about the subjective reality and focusing on adaptive mindsets. So my goal as a parent has been to try to help her instill a healthy mindset about eating, that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious."
Environment," That the experience of stress is inevitable, that it's natural. And that going through stressful experience can help her learn, grow, and become a more connected and happier individual. And with exercise and physical activity, we haven't really gotten to that yet,"
Environment," About exercise, about food, about school, about stress, about relationships, about relationship to self, et cetera. And to really think about that in a series of layers that you think that would be a useful exercise? Definitely, and you know, and your work speaks to this. I mean, the mindful, it's not"
Environment," for people to hear kind of, what do you do? This is what I'm asking. Yeah, well, it's certainly true in my case, that research is me search. Everything that I study as an intellectual has come from my own experience or my own failings, right? And when I was really intensely exercising and training,"
No," I don't think there's a obvious answer to your question other than the guiding light for me has been an undercurrent of understanding that our mindsets matter. I think I got that very clearly and deeply as a child, both through my experiences as an athlete. I know many of you listeners are athletes."
No," Any athlete knows that you can be the same physical being from one day to the next one moment to the next, and perform completely differently, just depending on what you're thinking. I was a gymnast growing up. And if you can't visualize, if you can't see something in your mind"
No," then you have no chance when you get up there on the balance beam, right? And also, my father was a martial artist, a teacher of meditation. So this kind of mind body work was baked into me from an early age. And I think what I've done recently,"
No," and just you have such an impact on the world. And I look forward. I hope we can do some science together also. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, all our papers and materials and interventions are housed on our website, mbl.stanford.edu. We also have a link there too,"
No," I don't do much there, but maybe I will start to. Well, those are all great resources. We will provide links to all of those for our listeners and viewers. And I also hope to convince you to write a book or many books in the future. The world needs to know about this,"

Environment," you know diminishing anxiety , diminishing stress , diminishing depression . You know all of those things that we 've talked about as we 've gone through how , by moving those in a downward motion , while increasing our exercise"
Environment," , exercise is great , but if , if you do n't understand why and what it 's leading to - and i mean look at a retired football player , for example - there 's many examples of these athletes who get done working . You know"
No," have to look at it from all those perspectives and just because you were an athlete were , does that mean it translates to the rest of your life that you 're just going to naturally , can you know , keep those genetics and"
No," more of the breakdown for this course in particular . But this is the dimensions of quality of life that we want to pay attention to in terms of psychological , the social aspect , the physical health part"
No," selfesteem like how do we perceive our body right , physical , you know . Are we mobile ? That 'S one of the things i think we kind of underestimate is that flexibility and that mobility and how we under underestimate that as a"
Environment," very good quality of life . Okay , social , we 're talking about relationships all right , whether it be social , sexual or personal , all right and then environmental factors there we go , you know , look at all the you know : health and social care , financial stability ."
Environment," You know , are you satisfied at work ? You know . Do you do anything for recreation or leisure ? How do you work with transport ? You know like ? Are you taking public transportation et cetera ? You know you never know"
Environment," Well , really , what you know we 're using this as a way to look and see how , as an exercise , scientist exercise specialist , we 're looking to this to kind of guide"
Environment," to show improvements and then to know how to prescribe appropriate exercise effectiveness so that we can basically make these people better . Movers feel better act , better , socialize , better , all right , all the"
No," You can calculate a numeric value to indicate the quality of one 's ones remaining years of life right now , that 's a little . That is a little uh more challenging , but we can still do that based on specific factors ."
Environment," measurement is what we would call your . You know your exercise , life , you know and that 's years of total exercise and that 's one thing that we can also work around too . Is you know , or you know , training life training years ?"
Environment," You know whatever it may be . Those are just things that we can work with and i think sometimes those are you know . Those are also very objective because , if you 're 35 years old and your training life is 23 , that means that you 've been working out for , since you were 12 years"
No," has no problems walking , they have no problems with selfcare . They have some problems with performing usual activities . They have some pain or discomfort or they 're , not anxious or depressed . They have a range score of maybe like"
No," right . So if we blow that up a little bit , you can see here , you know these are sample items that we could talk about . But how satisfactory are these different aspects of your life ? How is your family life ?"
No," Okay ? How is your family life ? You know you kind of answer that question what you know . What 'S your physical health like how you know , what 's your your your psychological health , you know what is your contacts , how you know how satisfactory are your"
No," contacts , and you know with your friends and your acquaintances ? How satisfied is your you know satisfactory ? Is your ability to manage your selfcare ? Can you actually take care of yourself all right"
No," from you or you as the person so you 're , the one that so it 's that 's why it 's subjective , but you know , if you 're a six on all these , then i mean we 're really . You know that means you 're , pretty satisfied and you 're can show that you can take care of"
Environment," think about all right . So when we go to the research part of everything all right , there 's some evidence that we can see from research that 's out in the world right now . Okay , that exercise can obviously improve"
Environment," improvements that and then specific populations , those with cancer , those who are pregnant , those who have diabetes . We can see that exercise can help them . You know in those specialized popula . You know those populations that we can"
Environment," enhance all right . So what are the dimensions that are most likely to be affected by our exercise ? Well , physical functioning , obviously so , with improved physical functioning , comes more of a"
No," a greater health status , a better health status . It helps we talked about it before with anxiety , stress , depression , all that stuff we create a better emotional state and from there when we feel better about ourselves ."
Environment," Okay , so those are those factors that are really heavily influenced now , some that might be influenced here , um that are gon na . You know factors that are gon na . You know really play their hand , is the purpose of the exercise intervention ?"
No," , wellbeing and the quality of life they have . We also want to see here the perceived value of you know the dimensions within healthrelated quality of life . Okay , so we want to make sure that we 're"
No," looking at how much we value those things like the psychological , the physical , the environmental , the social , okay and then the inclusion with other - and you know , health related quality of life , enhancing intervention . So what you know"
Environment," pretty pretty straightforward exercising you know , but if we looked at it from the standpoint of both exercise - and you know - physical , not just exercise but physical"
Environment," activity as well , based on you know , ability levels of individuals Exercise and physical activity improve selfefficacy and remember selfefficacy . Is that feeling that you are able to"
Environment," right now , of course , we hit those genetic limits , but they 're still striving for better striving for greatness okay , whereas those who need the assistance , because maybe they 're you know obviously in need of the change exercise - will improve their"
Environment," So you know again looking at these mechanisms for change . You know you have things like it says . Your quality exercise , participation , experiences so really what you 're getting here is what we would think"
Environment," we want to think about . Is this overall accumulation of over time ? You know it 's not just going to happen . It can happen in that first bout of exercise , but ultimately , what we 're saying here is that it 's an it 's an accumulation of all these"
Environment," Health related quality of life all right , but that 's just using exercise as that tool . Okay and saying that you know if you participate and exercise the experiences that you 're going to get from them from that participation are going to"
Environment," change , who you are in many different ways that it 's just a it 's a culminating effect of many different things , all right . So when we look at it from a visual perspective , you know you have there 's your physical environment , your"
Environment," activities are in social environment . There 'S you know with those we lead them to the elements of quality experiences like it says : autonomy , belongingness , challenge , engagement , mastery and meaning . Now all those individual quality"
No," experiences will lead to quality participation and then , ultimately , an improved health related quality of life in all of those you know those domains such as again , psychological physical health , social relationships and then the"
Environment," environment , okay . But if we can take those improvement , make improvements in the conditions that we have , that will enhance the elements that create better experiences , which we will then produce higher"
Environment," participation levels . Therefore , increasing our exercise needs and then eventually that leads to that quality of life and that 's taking what we said here and putting it into that visual representation . So we have a better"
No," It did n't really translate well to how he took care of himself , but then , when he comes in and starts seeing me as the you know , the the strength coach or the trainer whatever you want to call it . You know"
Environment," show that there 's going to be or that there 's a willingness that improvements will occur . Okay , there is the value of exercise to an individual 's health related quality of life . They have to show that there 's a value"
No," to why they 're exercising people hate exercising , but if you can show them the value to it , and then they can start feeling that value . That 'S going to make the change all right and then encourage various types of movement ."
No," , like fatigue , like pain , um depending upon . What 'S ? What 'S you know causing you know the issues with an individual ? You know we 're trying to avoid symptom flareups all right . Trying to you know , change that"
No," feeling of depression . You know , especially when you do n't feel good . You are depressed , so we 're trying to get them to feel better , but also remove that depression from how they feel you know . Try to get them to . You know"

Environment," exercise as medicine all right and that can help with these individuals by helping them move can be a form of medication for them . Okay , so those are just you know things that we 're looking for for recommendation purposes to make them"
Environment," feel better . All right so with you know , so what do we want to be ? We want to be a little bit more informational , okay , there 's that education piece . Okay , we want to be more behavioral . We want to be able to go back to that . You know that"
No," understanding . You know that you know there is support , no matter where these individuals go to coovercome these barriers and then also understand what the environmental component that you know . The accessibility is always"
No," like it was necessary because it is a good issue for debate but um . You know . Health , health , insurance companies and governmentfunded health care systems routinely cover the cost of drugs . To treat many chronic health conditions"
Environment," , i think you know where this is going well , based in for that last bullet . Why are n't they recognizing exercise as a treatment so that we , you know insurance or governmentfunded health ? Can you know these government funded"
Environment," health ? You know care systems that provide funding . Why are n't they ? You know covering the cost for exercise . You know : gym memberships , for equipment for trainers , other associated costs that come with it ."
Environment," Why are we not taking care of that ? Why is that that not part of it ? You know is exercise really that much of a threat to prescription drugs - i mean me personally , yes , i do think that is the case . I feel as though that you know exercise"
Environment," is , and we 've seen it all throughout . This whole course is that exercise is a va. A viable option to drugs for many different things all right , so why are we not able to fulfill that need for people who who really truly need it ? Okay , so just a"
No, i hope everybody really enjoyed the the lectures from this course because i think the psychological component of our courses - you know of this course the psychology or actually the psychological opponent of an of an exerciser .

I know you 're , probably thinking , but we 're only doing stretches , but it 's a good idea to warm up your body even"
Environment," for the last exercises , a lot of this tightness comes from a lot of our everyday positions , and if we spend a lot of time in a seated position , our hips are going to tighten up . So you will feel this stretch today stretching out those inner thighs and you you will feel a lot of relief because they can become tight over time . So let 's hold this for another twenty seconds following along with me feeling that stretch , let 's keep the"
Environment," of our lower body as Well so , as I 've said throughout this exercise , video , we do spend a lot of time in a seated position and what happens then our hips become tighter , now think about what happens when we sit down . Our legs are in this position , which means these muscles in the front of the hips become shorter , which , which is the tightness we 're getting . So what we 're going to do is stay up nice and tall"
Environment," Let 'S hold this for another thirty five seconds : that 's it maintain that upright posture with this exercise as well , do n't slouch over keep everything up right . Keep that core nice and tight excellent work , guys , let 's bring that knee a little bit further forward . As far as you feel comfortable make sure that back leg remains straight"

No, Hi guys today we are going to discuss about introduction and rules of mobility allowance . First of all we will discuss about introduction . Mobility allowance was a means tested monthly payment payable by the health
Environment," service , education hse to people who are aged 16 and over the under age . 66 and who have a disability and are unable to walk or use public transport and who would benefit from a change in"
No," surroundings , for example by financial , by financing the occasional taxi journey . There is no specific legislation providing for mobility allowance . Instead , this allowance was introduced in 1979 by the department of health and is payable under section 61 of the health"
No," act 1970 . In 2013 , the department of health announced that the mobility allowance scheme was closed to new applicants . An alternative scheme is being advised , replace it . This alternative scheme will be called"
Environment," the transport support scheme . In the meantime , the hse continues to make monthly payments to people who were getting the mobility allowance . At the time that the scheme closed . Now , we will discuss rules . The mobility allowance scheme is now"
No," close . The following rules applied when it was operation . You are eligible for mobility allowance . If you meet the following conditions , number one you are unable to walk , even even with the use of artificial climbs"
Environment," senior area , medical officer for your area . Now we will discuss about assessing income to determine the amount of mobility allowance you will receive . You calculate your total"
Environment, accessible income . You some income is not accessible in the case of a couple . Both your incomes are added together . Any amount in excess of the appropriate weekly social welfare payment for your family is deducted from the maximum amount of
No," weekly mobility allowance payable to you . The appropriate social welfare payment is disability allowance where you are under age 66 and state state pension noncontributory , where you are over age 66 . The appropriate weekly payment depends on"
No, whether you are a couple and have dependent children or not to calculate the maximum weekly mobility allowance . Here you multiply the monthly rate by 12 and then divide by 52 in the case of of a couple where both of
Environment," you are eligible , half of any amount in excess of the appropriate weekly social welfare payment for your family is deducted from the maximum amount of Weekly mobility allowance payable to you now we will discuss nonaccessible income . The following payments are not"
Environment," taken into account in accessing your means : blind welfare allowance , child benefit , salary care allowance , foster care allowance , higher education grants , national fuel"
Environment," scheme allowance payments , leaving alone allowance over 80 alarms . Supplementary welfare allowance income up to maximum of amount approved by the department of social protection dsp from"
No," , the benefit of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme . Now we will discuss carers payments if your spouse , civil partner cohabitant , is receiving care , carers , allowance or carers benefit . The payment"
Environment," is ignored . Instead , your income is assessed by being your primary payment , plus any increases for qualified children , plus the supplementary welfare allowance increase for a qualified adult where carer 's allowance for carers benefit is paid in respect of you to"
Environment," someone who is not your spouse , civil partner cohabitant , it Is ignored that and you are assessed on your own accessible income capital . The formula used in the assessment of the income from capital is"
Environment," the same as that used by the dsp in the means test for disability allowance motorized transport grant . If you receive a motorized transport grant , having previously received the mobility allowance , you will no longer receive the mobility allowance . This is"
Environment, because the payment of a motorized transport grant is subject to the condition that the hse will not be called called upon upon at any future date of contribute towards the running costs of the vehicle .
Environment, You will not be eligible for the mobility allowance again until three years after the date of payment of the motorized transport grant appealing the refusal of mobility allowance . There is no state reappeal .
No," There is no strategy appeal scheme for mobility allowance . In other words , if you have been refused mobility allowance by your local health office , your right to appeal is not set down in law where an applicant is refused , the hsc will"
No, formally notify notify you of their decision and include details of how to appeal this decision Appeal procedures for mobility allowance can vary from one local health office to another . Some
No," Happiness many will advise you how to obtain it but maybe you're not trying to be happy. Your actions aim for the opposite. You want to be the saddest saddo sailing on the sea of sadness much easier to achieve and this video has 7 tactics to get you started toward the dark currents, at least one of which you are already doing. So let's begin. First, stay still. Remain indoors as much as possible, preferably in the same room. Be the human equivalent of a pile of laundry inert, unmoving. Don't let a beautiful day tempt you for a walk. Avoid"
No," anything even vaguely exercisial. This keeps reward chemicals out of your brain which could diverge you and stillness guides you towards medical problems which will keep this wheel turning. Stillness is the most effective thing you can do, so be the laundry pile. Make your bedroom your allroom. Live and work and play and sleep in the smallest radius you can. Which brings us to screw with your sleep. The wrath of insomnia will be your copilot on the sea of sadness. Her mere presence is unpleasant, but she also helps confuse the"
No," productive part of your brain which might look to navigate you toward the islands of happiness on the horizon. More on that later. A regular sleep cycle is a fragile thing and takes at least three days to establish. Be sure then to vary your bedtime by several hours twice a week, at least. Even better: vary your wake time. Sleep in late, preferably very late, some but not all days. And tell yourself you are making up for sleep to feel like you're doing something healthy even though you feel terrible when you wake up early and when"
No," you wake up late. Irregular sleep is another of the sea's accelerating currents. The more you vary your sleep, the harder regular sleep becomes, which makes your sleep more variable. To never sleep or wake at the same time naturally is the goal. And to help in this, maximize your screen time. Staying onscreen complements the previous sailing tactics. Boredom could drive you to motion, so let the screen entertain you. Tiredness can push you to sleep, so let the screen keep you awake, sort of, as long as possible. Always fall asleep with a screen in your"
No," hand and put your eyes back on it as soon as you wake. Every moment away from a screen is a moment you might notice the horizon. Keep your head down and let the currents pull you. Here you have allies unknown. Behind the screen are teams of the smartest people and brightest bots competing to hold your attention on them as long as possible. Let them reach you to pull you back if you turn away. Plus, screens help with number four: use your screen to stoke your negative emotions, to feed your anger or anxiety about things over"
No," you feel like it, which will be never or never enough to matter. With vapid goals, you will turn the productive part of your brain from a dangerous source of selfimprovement that rewards every small step into a consistent nag that berates you for your failure to have already accomplished your goal every step of the way. Now the vapid goals you've set should distract the productive part of your brain, but if it still fights against you, direct it towards the mirage on the sea of sadness: the islands of happiness"
Environment," do that. Aim toward the mirage of happiness rather than improving the ship upon which you sail. Last, but most important, follow your instincts. Navigation deeper into the sea of sadness is quite easy, for there is a dark magnetic field that points the compass of your impulses in the right direction once you get started. You will want to stay indoors, you will want to not exercise, you will want to sleep in, you will want to do what you know will make you sadder after you've done it. Your compass points the way, both in and"
No," out, so follow the true north of your impulses and stay away from that other pole of the longterm. It's all so simple. Just get started with these tactics and let the sea carry you along. This video was produced as an adaptation of How to Be Miserable by Dr. Randy J. Patterson, which is a great example of how thinking about the opposite of your goal can help you achieve what you really want.

No, uh . What is unconditional selfacceptance ? How do i recover from harm ocd hocd ? How do i recover from rsds to broads ? It needs to be a little bit more specific for the for the instagram lives . Now . What i also wanted to talk about was physical symptoms of anxiety
No," , so physical symptoms , what happens here well most of my journey initially was predominantly in re related to anxiety , thinking . That was anxious . Thinking with something that scared me and then feeling that latched on it"
No," was n't very physical , barely had any heart , palpitations barely felt much more sensations more than the anxiety in my sort of head that sort of sensation that was about it and it was primarily fears . Like fear of"
No," getting hiv health , health ocd related fears , and that was it literally nothing more than that , and at that time i was i could . I felt like a normal person socalled normal person uh just with some fear and just with it"
No," latched , and that was it . I had no idea about ocd . I had no idea that anything else it just felt like if i was scared of something like i do n't know when i used to uh talking in when i was 13 14 in that era , when i used to go to skate park"
No," , uh , rollerblading and so on , And going down a ramp that anxiety of thinking going into that half pipe thinking , that 's i could fall over and hurt myself well . That was related to the anxiety in relation to um , to the fears that i had at the time"
No," i used to feel palpitations a lot i used to feel chronic pain in my neck . In my back , i used to feel dry mouth . I used to feel uh what other things did i have . I had a lot of sweating all these kinds of things"
No," : uh waking up in the night intermittent waking up , uh , joint pain , um , jittery , feeling uh restlessness , that was sort of an internal sort of vibration of restlessness , as often with palpitations and sort of"
No," initially my journey began with having more of a thoughts based anxiety , um , where there was always led up by a thought . The thought was the catalyst , but then some people do n't ever have a physical part . They are predominantly"
No," stuck in um in a thinking and a thoughts based anxiety . Some people have more physical . For me . It phased into more physical as time passed and then became primarily physical and then with developing gid , generalized"
No," anxiety disorder . It was what just felt like chronic physical all the time without a thought and without a fear specifically there , and that was then at play for a long time before that faded down now . In that time , the physical symptoms"
No," , whether you 're trying to learn a new sport or a new skill . You'Ve practiced that in a sort of negative cycle . Because of how the anxiety has been there . So the brain 's learnt to fire up that system like that"
Environment," and then in the general anxiety disorder . It 'S fired up automatically as a sort of protective mechanism against the environment and how you see the world , and so that 's very much there , especially a fear of death or something because"
No," death is a part of our perspective of life . If we 're very scared of death , that 's then seeping into our reality and how we 're experiencing it today the same as existential ocd does just that , because it 's how we 're observing"
Environment," our reality around us , it 's sort of income allencompassing in this sort of anxietylike internal web . That 'S keeping us trapped in there in a physical anxiety form now . Medication can obviously help reduce that , and often by reducing those"
No," symptoms , then the ocd sufferer feels freer and feels more alive and feels more confident . Often it can bring other physical sensations , which they can then become scared of those too"
No," , but physical symptoms are different for everyone in all the years that i 've been doing this , i see people with all kinds of physical symptoms . Nervous system is obviously running throughout the whole body , so you can have anything , never underestimate how much it can"
No," mimic these things . It can mimic sensations in your groin . It can mimic sensations in your heart . It can create real sensations of pain in your heart , groin arms , eyes , ears . Everything absolutely anything and physical"
No," symptoms are particularly frustrating , because it feels at that point that you have done this to yourself , that you have made yourself physically ill , that you are destroying your body through your thinking , especially if you"
No," have the belief that i am doing this To myself i am , i am responsible for bringing about this ocd , something that i thought when i was 13 . 12 13 . I used to think i just stopped thinking like this and"
No," you 're doing this . You know in a subtle format before it became chronic , and so it 's very easy to get into that habit of thinking . Like that 's a very , very easy thing to do , we all do that at times . So , in terms of physical symptoms , a lot"
No," of it is about learning , to observe them and leave them be . A lot of it is obviously at the core getting into what you 're scared of , but you do need to wear them like an uncomfortable coat too for them to fade down . But it 's the"
No, body . Now let me just go back to some of these questions that have come up feeling discomfort around my partner and all of a sudden it disappears . We cover this in great detail in the youtube channel in the rocd playlist
No," , but the reason it 's going to turn up around your partner or away from your partner . It just depends on how the fear is latching , so it will do that with different fears , but you ca n't get into changing your external"
Environment," environment to escape the sensation internally , because that is the compulsion very first step to taking recovery . We have a webinar coming up on that um . If you have a look at instagram"
Environment," stories on our page , all about where to begin in the ocd recovery journey , i tense my muscles a lot and ca n't stop it . Is that also to do with ocd ? It can be , it can be a sort of reflex to do with control and safety and just feeling"
Environment," hunching your shoulders like this . You could get used to that sensation , um and then it becomes a habit . You'Ve only got to look at people who go to the gym , a lot who might want to look in a certain way with their shoulders , they 'll tensile their shoulders up and hold that"
No," position because they like how that looks , and then that actually bit by bit is Causing them to strain their back , so you know we , we we 're not always aware of things we 're doing like tension in our jaw , holding our jaw tight . All these kinds of"
No," , because the reason that is so important is ocd is always wanting you to work it out to sort of find this imaginary key for a lock that does n't exist . So we 've got to get used to that sensation of discomfort"
No," inside the head suggestions for documentaries , tv shows to watch as exposures in regards to harm ocd . Well , those need to be specifically chosen in relation to how your harm ocd is getting in what area ? Maybe it 's fear of being a psychopath or"
No," a rapist uh somebody who stabbed someone , someone kills their family whatever and that 's got to be tailored for that . But then you can . You can usually think of ways to target that and sort of"
No," gentler ways to build that up . We can invent a lot of those ourselves , but it obviously helps hugely by speaking to someone like me who who understands how to tailor that specifically to what you uh fear uh . But you you you need"
No," When you cut the compulsions out , helps us to become more internally free and feel more alive and better little by little more and more . So that 's why it 's so important that we cut those compulsions out . Those are the drug of choice for ocd"
No," sufferers . Those are what ocd sufferers want so much and ocd sufferers uh , sort of that 's their addiction , the drug of choice , the getting the compulsion uh getting that illusion of certainty"
No," careful of that , and we need to observe that just going through these questions , how do i let go of controlling my throat and swallowing by controlling i mean consciously thinking of every swallowing that is sensory . Motor ocd we 've got some"
No," , hundreds of times a day , all the time and they become an automatic habit that we then start doing sort of almost just just everywhere , because we get so used to doing that . Fear of getting a specific , intrusive thought forever . That is one"
No," particular image in your head for the rest of your life , that 's one of the main areas that it latched to initially , and it can do that in various settings . It could do it like driving down the road . You see a car"
No," crash thinking . What if i saw something that means i 'm never going to be able to get that image out my head , various various things like that , because we 've got a disorder that creates a chronic locked on sensation"
No," and because we can remember that it 's very easy to become scared Of it itself being locked on in that chronic format or anxiety , locked on in chronic format or all of that in various ways , we 're very hyper"
No," vigilant to uh fear of fear and a sort of continuous cycle that does n't stop . How do we control anxiety ? Well , that question we 're learning tools to get a better understanding of anxiety"
No," , so it can flow through us and it does n't have us now . That is not control . When we 're trying to control anxiety does the opposite . We try and control anxiety . It controls us . So it 's about viewing it"
No," like this flowing sort of energy or flowing water , whatever that 's just passing through it 's raising up and down just like the sea is coming in and out on the shore and leaving that to occur not getting into that battle , because it 's"
No," nature , it 's in tone . I can speak to somebody and in two or three minutes , i 've never met never having met them hearing about their ocd and anxiety , see straight away through the tone of voice how"
No, locked and internally um they 're pushing back against it just in their tone of voice . Usually you can hear things like they 'll say : hi rob . I just want to talk to you a bit about my anxiety . I was trying to work this out and then i
No, did this and then i just ca n't remember what i was thinking and then it did that and then i thought this and i tried to release that . And i do n't understand that and you can just hear it 's like cogs that are all locked up and that 's
No," because they 're thinking , it 's also rigid in black and white they 're sort of in this very fixed dimension , they 're trying to sort of move like this , whereas we 're trying To let all of this just flow out"
No," okay , so that is key , because it is that internal coglike , locking up mechanism , that 's causing the anxiety cycle to have that fuel . That 'S a key point very key point to remember . A lot of questions are asking things like"
No," can such and such occurrence lead to ocd lead to this . That was a path i went down for so long trying to work out . Why am i thinking like this ? Why am i like this ? Why am i feeling this ? Why am i experiencing this ? What has happened in my mind , genetics"
No," inside that 's fueling the anxiety . Now that does n't come down just as having an understanding of that , we have to bring down the fears too , so all together , gradually that fades out . How do we accept that this is for life ? It does n't really matter because"
No," now that no no , i said that quickly , but it , but it 's true , it does n't matter , because the disorder has no power without fear . So it 's not like an illness which you need to take 20 different tablets to"
No," prevent it , killing you uh . It 'S it 's . It 'S it 's com . It 'S only fueled by fear . Once the fear is brought down , you ca n't tell you 've got it , you ca n't you you feel just as you ever did you feel completely at peace . It 'S not there . The only thing is"
No, the fear fueling it . That 'S all it 's got . That 'S all that there is time and patience is a huge key for those suffering . Remember to give time a chance brianna talking about that there from our youtube channel very true . You ca n't beat
No," Why ? Because it feels [ __ ] , when you 're suffering really badly from anxiety a lot of time . Yes , you get used to wearing it and becoming more comfortable with it and able to live your live your life , and then you do n't like"
No," if i had 30 40 anxiety for the rest of my life , i still do everything it would n't be that big a deal , But to me when it was really ramped on , i learned to hate , i had to become really comfortable with wearing it like an"
No, all that time was experienced with anxiety - and i did n't want that - i wanted rid of that sensation - i did n't want to experience an ounce of it . That was the problem . It was a perfectionist internal eradication
No," This learning to practice this general state of acceptance not needing to know is everything : okay , being okay with things not being okay , even if you were n't it well , so you had a terminal illness ."
No," What are you gon na ? Do you can only do what 's in front of you to get better and the rest of the time you 've got to accept it , we 're all technically terminally or we 're all going to be dead in 40 , 50 years 30 . 40 years depends how old"
No, of internal surrender . How do i do that rob ? How do i internal surrender ? I do n't know how i do n't know what to do . It 'S a process that you 're gradually learning to embody . How please tell me how to get rid of
No," fear . You ca n't just have an answer . That 'S a tip or trick that solves this people often say to me : i get hundreds of messages a week saying rob just a moment at your time , quick tip and trick"
No," of places , running therapy as a format of come in and do uh these five sessions and you 're done uh . And if you 're not , then maybe you 're treatment , resistant people , panic that used to happen a lot because people used to say oh well , there 's five cbt"
No," , that 's going to help and improve , but when you 're putting a fixed deadline - and you get into a tricky scenario when it comes to anxiety , you have to have rough guides And say : okay : well , if you 're , not this has n't helped . By that point , then we"
Environment," , because it does n't work that it 's the same as if you went to a gym and you wanted to get in better shape . And you saw a personal trainer and said i 'm going to sign up for two months and work really hard . It 'S my chance of getting good"
No," am in terms of acceptance and think jesus . You know he 's still holding on to lots of society constraints in terms of things like , maybe even wearing a tshirt as opposed to what he would wear thinking . That 'S something that 's uh , some other constraints , so"
No, there 's levels in terms of how i want to function in society and my goals and what i want to do and what he wants to do . But ocd and anxiety operates on that spectrum to some to it to a degree of acceptance . Where
No," , once you get to a certain point , then the anxiety fades down now . Obviously , the journey can continue further and further in a lifetime , and one buddhist monk to another will see another one as far beyond his point . So it 's a journey ."
No," , which is what is at the core of so much stress , anxiety , internal clinging . That 'S the message of today that i wanted to cover - and i will be back on here soon doing some more of these instagram lives on different sections"
No," um . So i hope that you have found that helpful and uh these will get uploaded to the youtube channel um . Please , if you watch our youtube videos , please follow our account . We'Re trying to"

Those are all important things that are going to help . You ensure . Is this something that you can live 24/7 , which is something you do want to consider"
No," now that you 're on your way to finding your personal values , you have to remember you : do n't live your life from uh nine to five or five to nine . You live it 24/7 . So find those personal values and then also translate that to work . So what do you value at work ? So what I want to give to you is this : in the download below when you 're at work . You probably do projects you 're hanging out with people learn how to be successful by ensuring you do n't make these mistakes ."
No," Hi everyone - this is iketirina and this week we 'll be talking about our values and beliefs . Most importantly , what is the difference between those two and why is it so important to be able to identify your own core values and how your beliefs can impact your interaction with"
No, other people ? I'Ll show a personal example of how i make that connection between my value ? A difficult situation i had to face and how this selfreflection helped me to let go of this particular stressful moment .
No," So , let 's start by talking about values and to put it simply , values are the characteristics , the ideas , the qualities that we feel very strongly about . In a way , they define what is of war to us and i 'm referring to both things that"
No," are beneficial and things that are harmful and in a way , values affect every aspect of our lives , because it affects our behaviors , our interaction with people . The way we speak our goals , our targets and they even have an effect on pretty"
No," much hundreds of decisions we make every single day . So , in a way you can say that values direct our life and in our class in college , we were asked a very standard question about . Well , what would you do if you found a wallet lying on the street and there was"
No," different answer to this question because of some of our core values . Let 'S revise another question : let 's say you won a lottery , so you 've just won . I do n't know hundred thousand pounds and this is a cash that is truly yours . You do n't have to think about giving it back"
No," contribute to a mortgage and buy a house some mentioned that they would like to support their kids through college , and when i was faced with this question , the first thing that came to my Mind was to make sure that my family was financially secure , so i thought of"
No," about savings investments and in the end , i think i only allowed myself to really use about 10 of that money . So , let 's say 10 000 to perhaps travel a little bit or you know take my friends for a nice trip , so you can see how obviously it reflects"
No," the values i have , and it also reflects the priority of those values because i definitely put my family first . Then kind of all the organization planning with regards to making sure my future is secure and only then kind of meeting my current needs of seeing the world or"
No," traveling , or you know , buying a couple of things for myself and another important things about values that we Need to understand is the fact that they come from our experience of being human , so they show us the things that we need"
No," , the things that we find important and sometimes the things that we miss in our lives . So , in my case , as somebody who lives in uk , while most of my family is back in estonia and that 's been the situation for the last 14 years , i certainly have"
No," been feeling a bit isolated and in a way regretful of not being able to fully be Involved in their life or support them because growing up it was a very small family , but we were very much supportive for one another ."
No," So i think there 's a bit of a regret and there 's a bit of that kind of missing of what i could have had . If i stayed back in estonia , hence you know by me thinking about making sure they 're financially secure , making sure that they do n't have worries"
No," about their living conditions is my way of expressing the family value and different people who will say that family means the world to Them will have different ways of interpreting that value , so it will still affect how exactly you show those values"
No," , even though you know , my interpretation of what i will do to family is different , maybe from another person 's . Nonetheless , i think it 's also helped me to understand that sometimes when people grow up without maybe having very happy childhood"
No," memories as they mature and create their own families , they become very protective of that family . They really want their children to have the happiest time ever . They wanted to give them the things they never had and again that comes from the"
No," fact that values are not always about the things we have . It 'S sometimes about the things . We'Ve missed the things we really wanted to have in our life , and this is how it 's affecting some of the behaviors we develop as adults . So i really found very interesting this link"
No," and this connection that i did n't think of before and another thing that i think is worth mentioning is that as our life conditions change , so do our values . So sometimes we gain new values . We kind of let go of some old ones or we just"
No," rearrange the priority order , because in the end of the day , it would be foolish for us to think that oral values are on the equal level . In fact , some of them are definitely more important than others and , as i spoke to one individual , it was very interesting that they remarked that"
No," you know family was important value for them , but as they grew up , they realized that sometimes they found interaction with some particular Family members very challenging and they often felt very unsettled and upset after meeting them . So with time , they had to find the"
No," courage to accept the fact that their mental state was more important , that perhaps meeting the needs of the family and they decided to limit the amount of interaction they have with their . You know cousins , or even sometimes parents , because they felt that their emotional"
No," state was more important , and here certainly this process of questioning and challenging your values is a good practice because they really understood what was more important to them and it did n't change the fact that You know they still love the family or"
No," they would still support them , but they just had to change the priority and put themselves a bit higher in that ladder and , obviously before you can challenge anything or change your values , you first need to define them and i Think this is again something we"
No," do n't do very often , you know just sitting down and thinking well , what are my core values but as a part of this course , where we really challenged and said well , here 's the time sit down and think about your values . I found it very useful and i would definitely recommend"
No, to anyone . You know watching this video to just find some time and really think of the values of your life . What is truly important ? What is something that you could n't ? Imagine your life without and another interesting thing . I learned in this course is that people often mix
No," up their own values and their beliefs and , in fact , there 's quite a bit of a difference between those two , even though i myself struggle to put it rightly in the words . But the thing is that our beliefs are basically assumptions that we make , based"
Environment," Nonetheless , i think you can all agree that , with our world constantly changing it 's a very complex environment , it will be sometimes not really beneficial to base our decisions about the future ."
No," On experiences we had in the past , because they are not always going to apply and in some way we are not always supporting ourselves in the most efficient way or meeting our needs by using our beliefs to make the decisions ."
No," Hence why ? It 'S really good for everyone to again understand which things are our core values . You know the things that are universally shared between people and which things are our personal beliefs , things that we formed from our life experiences , which are sometimes not"
No," even true , and make sure that , when you interact with people , you made the right decisions that are based more Or less on facts on you know your true values , as opposed to things that sometimes , as i said , might be not very correct and , as promised , i wanted to share with"
No," you an example of how i was able to link a very difficult situation with one of My core values , and in fact , what happened here a few weeks ago , is that i had a rather tricky conversation with one of my friends and afterwards i felt that it was on my"
No," , so i think it was more bugging me , not the station itself , but the fact that i just could n't let it go and gladly i was able to talk to another friend of mine she 's , A nurse she lives in estonia and she 's , currently studying for a very similar course , as i 'm doing"
No," here so she 's also thinking about becoming maybe a therapist or a counselor or anyone else who can support people coming with you know difficult situations or stress or just who Needs a bit of support and , as she listened to my story in a way you could say we had a"
No," bit of a counseling session . She did ask me if i felt that the conversation i had with that other person has touched on a very kind of sensitive trigger for me whether that person has challenged one of my core values and in fact , as i analyzed this , you know"
No," this was a Very simple question she asked , but suddenly i realized that that was the actual situation . The fact that the other person - you know whether knowingly or unknowingly , have touched on a very sensitive topic for me , because it was one of my core values and i"
No," definitely felt challenged or in a way that other person believed that i did n't possess . That value at all , now , i 'm not saying that that person was wrong . Everyone has to write their own opinions , so it 's not about you know about them being wrong . It 'S just"
No," the fact that i , without realizing , was quite affected by the conversation , because one of my core values was challenged and perhaps the way i reacted in that situation was not the most pleasant way as well"
No," , and certainly after having this conversation after making that connection , I was able to let go , and i felt so much more pleased with myself and also that that whole pressure was gone , because i could finally clearly see as to what has"
No," happened . Why . I reacted in a particular way and it also made me think about the future interactions i might have with that person . Other people , if they ever challenge me again on my core beliefs , that i need to be just more selfaware and perhaps take myself out of that"
No, situation or just be calmer and try to explain my reaction . So for me it was very insightful . This learning i really enjoy going through that process of selfreflection analyzing the situation and making that connection
No," , and certainly in the future . I might have also clients that will face similar problems whereby they will have a difficult situation and they just would n't be able to make sense of it . So , together , just like my friend supported me , we will try to find"
No," what is the core reason for that distress . Their feeling , so i hope you enjoyed today 's video next week , i 'll be talking about different types of support that the counselors might seek as they 're seeing the clients , because , in the end of the day , it 's not"
Environment, The health and prosperity of humanity is directly tied with the state of environment . This statement from the united nations emphasizes the important relationship between our physical health and the environment that we live in throughout history . We have relied on
No," nature to help us overcome illness and disease . For example , for hundreds of years , the only known treatment for malaria was quinine taken from the centrality . Nowadays , half of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals are originally derived from natural sources ."
Environment," to 50 of medicinal plant species could be extinct by the end of the century . The environment brings other benefits to our health . More broadly , research suggests that living in a greener environment can promote and protect good health and recovery from illness . One study found"
Environment," that people who spent two hours or more a week in or around green spaces were significantly more likely to report good health or high wellbeing . However , people living in deprived areas are not only more likely to have poorer health outcomes but lower quality environments"
Environment," and reduce access to green space too . Furthermore , it is well documented that environmental problems such as air pollution affect our health detrimentally . The environment agency has claimed that universal access to healthy natural environment can save the nhs"
No," billions of pounds a year in treatment costs through the practice of green social prescribing . People are connected to naturebased activities with health benefits such as walking groups , community gardening and food growing projects . In 2020 , the uk government"
Environment," announced a 5 million pound investment for green prescribing schemes in the community 's hardest hit by covert 19 . It is abundantly clear that our environment can help us live healthy lives . However , in order for this to happen , we must work to keep our environment in a healthy"
Environment," So the next speaker we have is uh professor dr nohayathi , who is basically from the department of build environment for culture of department , building survey , forgotten environment yati is basically host a degree from the"
Environment," pursue a phd from university reading in you know , uk under the indoor environment and energy research group . So currently , basically , what she 's going to explain to us is wellbeing and the indoor physical environment"
Environment," towards the uh . Last final last , two of my final slide , end of the slides but uh . More of the slides are basically talking about into physical environment and wellbeing of the healthcare workers , which i think at this"
Environment," of the healthcare workers are being taken care of taken care of . So , as we all know , hospital is a complex building . It is not like a shopping complex . It 'S not like an offices , it 's not even like a education institution"
Environment," , because you have to really look into very the tiny and the teeny weeny bits of hospital facilities that you need to actually offer . So hospital represent a uniquely complex environment because it accommodates multiple"
Environment," higher risk of health symptoms and actually can actually , you know , transmit to the healthcare workers as well and the relationship between the physical environment , Wellbeing and the comfort of occupants may vary"
Environment," , it 's like a totally different thing to actually look into with different needs and different kinds of situations , and therefore , management must also take an active part in defining the physical environment"
Environment," for conducive working environment to all healthcare workers , because chronic stress impacts will Workplace wellbeing . Okay , so now i 'm sure you 've seen all these pictures throughout this one year . 2020 . We know"
No," So , as the number of profit 19 cases in the country , spikes the front liners are facing increasingly long hours , fatigue and mounting of frustrations . I think only the front liners the only the healthcare workers"
Environment," in in terms of just giving some awareness to the healthcare providers that uh the physical environments are basically very important for The healthcare workers to be productive , these um issues that healthcare workers"
No," quote and unquote of some nurses and also some doctors , okay , so one um one of them one . One of the several remarks is that to protect other medics , we are fearful of being infected . Anyone who coughs in the office or"
No," know just sneezing because of dust or ac actually affected , so i think this happens to everyone and in in the early stage of this pandemic . I think this is what is being fearful . So if one is infected , all medics in the unit are engaged ."
No," with an infection disease dies , the body is wrapped in several layers of cloth , packed into two bags which are sprayed with this . It is a little hard to accept this form of death . Okay , especially when it is your relative ."
No," , you know , feel uh how how the it can actually lead to mental illness uh uh - hopefully that 's , hopefully not not that you know critical , but learning can actually impact . You know"
Environment," physical environment that they will be facing dailies in their working last for the next few years , so that the word quality life balance as well as The healing environment , not only to the"
Environment," staff efficiency and to maintain patients healing process . Okay , so therefore the physical environment again works and plays a vital role in employees , productivity . So research indicates that staff , wellbeing"
Environment," , productivity and satisfaction are linked with a hospital 's physical environment , in particular the aspects that are determined during the early stage in early design stage of building life cycles ."
Environment," So uh , hopefully that after this , if there 's a new hospitals that will be designed , uh things on physical environment , taking care , taking a high consideration from the design aspects and also asking"
Environment," the physical environment as well . It can be improved by looking into the circulation . One of the examples that i can give you today there 's a lot of examples , but uh it 's gon na take a long hours to explain that i 'm just"
No," I hope it can be like this , but if you can see the the space um okay , so if you can see these are colors of lines which the roots of the uh individual you know for the green one is the"
Environment," environment factors there 's a few yes there 's quite a lot actually but uh , it 's very . Basically , it 's not that difficult to implement or to apply , but it it can be quite costly if it 's if it 's a renovation work , but if it 's"
Environment," care of , so the first one is artwork and healing process and also the light and views auditory , environment , musical , sound and therapy landscapes . So i 'm just gon na explain very very briefly on each of"
Environment," white blank ball , so you ca n't see anything . It 'S like uh ! Something is not right and you feel bored . So human wellbeing is achieved through a series of open visual interactions , benefit of art in the healing environment , leading to"
Environment, reduced hospital stays by one day . This is a research that has been carried out to patients reduction in the amount of painkillers taken by patients when art was in the environment . So these
Environment," you know needs to be considered , because you need to see the daylight . You need to see the views outside for you to at least you know , come and also have a different um environment during your working hours . So nothing can challenge the healing"
No," by decreasing fatigue , increasing the release of endorphins and promote emotional wellbeing and high intensity of artificial lights , appear to decrease errors in medication , preparation"
Environment," reduce your stress or something would be nice to have this . Okay , so there 's another one which is auditory environment . Interruptions on on an ongoing noise can have real implications on work"
Environment," , productivity and sleep quality of patients , not only for patients . I think , if you 're working long hours with all sorts of noise , you get annoyed main sources of high noise levels , are medical devices"
Environment," , building materials and curtains , and also conversations okay , so healthcare workers perceive high noise levels related to feeling sick at the end of the day . Okay , so i 'm just gon na show you an example : okay , listen to the difference"
No," or you know uh . Sometimes when you have this uh chronic reading . Quran reading is so also good , because it 's giving you calm - and you know - reduce your stress fear so that you have a healthy and a"
Environment, and the wellbeing in healthcare environments and activities can be all sorts of things outside in the garden . So i 'm going to show you one of the slides which one of my colleagues in the faculty of build
Environment, environment has actually done about the therapeutic ratio . So just a few minutes of slides so that you can see what has been done and something which is a good activities to be carried out
Environment," during the breaks to release stress here . These are all works carried out by dr hazrina , one of my colleagues in the faculty of good environment , okay , moving on there 's , also architectural design"
No," that is being carried out earlier on can actually impact and give effect to the efficiency of the working productivity . So , apart from that design , what layouts and necessitations to reduce stuff , walking and fatigue and"
Environment," air quality during the construction and then we 'll further uh . You know uh deteriorate all sorts of uh quality in terms of the environment later on when it 's already being vacant , so reduce contamination rate of interior"
Environment," and then create environments that stimulate the mind in order to create pleasure , creative and satisfaction and enjoyment throughout the day the healthcare workers , the doctors , nurses , have actually worked really"
Environment," hour is the best . You know time for them to have this kind of environment uh , to uh , to look away from the patient 's problem , look away from other . You know aspects in just to rest , and you know : relax uh"
Environment, which uh represent nature uh around the room and you can create activities or whatever that you you can to actually give a different environment settings while not taking care of the patients
Environment," so that you have color and its impact to the environment . Obviously , with different colors gives you different psychological effects and also cleanliness and ease of maintenance . Okay , it is very important , especially during"
Environment," , so if you see here , f1 transmission of kovite 19 outbreak in the indoor environment is likely when the ventilation rate is less than three meter per second per person . So you need to have higher or double the the rate or a minimum guideline says : 12 ."
Environment," From the minute we're born, we're aging. Constant exposure to our environment, the things we eat, and stresses from both inside and outside our bodies all cause us to age over time. Aging is highly complex, but scientists are starting to understand what happens at the cellular and molecular levels. For example, healthy cells are damaged over time when our immune systems shift from reacting to shortterm problems like injuries and infections, to gradually producing chronic inflammation"
No," We begin to experience their effects early in life. For example, we lose the ability to hear certain highfrequency sounds as teenagers, our cognition and memory slowly decline after they peak in our mid20s, the strength of our bones starts to decrease in our 30s, female fertility sharply declines after 35, agerelated nearsightedness begins in our mid40s, and our hair starts to gray and thin as early as our 30s and 40s. After the age of 50, the changes of aging become increasingly noticeable, and because aging is the biggest risk factor for most of the diseases that affect us as adults,"
No," the older we get, the higher our risk of chronic disease becomes. While scientists have not yet found a way to stop these processes of aging, they are learning more and more about how to maintain health throughout our lives. Some aspects of aging are out of our controllike our genetics and our family historybut we can educate ourselves about moderate risk factors and do our best to reduce them through healthy lifestyle and diet choices. Most of us can be healthy and active well into our later years, if we take care of ourselves."
No," It's no surprise that regular physical activity can help maintain a healthy weight, improve moods and sleep habits, and boost overall health. And it's clear that a wellbalanced diet full or nutritious foods, is critical to good health. But when it comes to understanding which foods are the best choices, much nutrition research has focused on how certain foods or nutrients may have a negative effect on health, or even play a role in disease development. More recently, scientists have begun to explore and understand how nutrition may play a role"
No," in promoting healthy aging throughout of all life's stages. We are rapidly learning about what foods and nutrients should be emphasized in our diets, and how they can enhance our health. Diets full of fruits and veggies, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean meats, have proven health benefits like lowering blood pressure, improving glucose control in diabetes, weight loss, improving arthritis, and reducing the risk of cancer and cardiovascular events, to name a few."
No," And we are learning more about the specific nutrients that can impact health. For example, plant pigments found in bright orange and red fruits and vegetables may prevent and slow the progression of eye diseases. Calcium helps to keep bones strong. B vitamins play a role in maintaining brain health. And flavanoids from many plants may improve the health of our cardiovascular systems. The bottom line is that YOU have the power to maintain and improve your health, add vitality"
No," to your years, and reduce your risk of disease. And it's never too late to make a change. To learn more about the nutrients that are critical to your health, and how to safely turn to supplements if you aren't getting enough of these nutrients in your diet, watch Healthy Aging With Nutrition at www.agingresearch.org/nutrition."
Environment," me so bear with me uh , my name is I 'm an associate professor of occupational therapy and Rehabilitation got my education in Jordan and in Minnesota , United States . My major uh or main specialty is in uh stroke"
Environment," Rehabilitation . I developed the occupational task oriented approach . I wrote in physical dysfunction , uh crumbly textbook evaluating motor deficits , uh both neurological uh challenges , but uh . My line of research is about physical dysfunctions in affecting"
Environment," adults , adults , physical dysfunctions and specifically uh occupational stress . So that 's been said . I have been studying occupational groups and been honored to publish in work Journal . That is a very Optimum uh environment for my publication . So thank you for coming"
No," today . Next slide , please ! So today we are going to talk about mental and physical health , related equality of life and their Associated factors affecting uh college students in a comprehensive Allied Health , uh institution . So uh we are studying"
No," , musculoskeletal stressors and then mental health stressors , Etc . Then I wanted to to get the big picture . Everything affects eventually quality of life in the literature . Unfortunately , there is no uh exact , uh exclusive definition of equality of life , but what"
Environment," I choose to do is to Target health related equality of life , which is one approach to tackle quality of life . Quality of life , for me , is the ultimate umbrella for our work in Rehabilitation . Eventually , we want to be clientcentered , we wan na specific . We want to be ICF"
No," when you are talking about quality of life or health related quality of life as an approach , it 's uh , it 's all about the person 's specific perception of his style , his uh situation , his own hair situation in the system that he or culture and the values that he Belongs"
No," , so there 's a significant value for this subjectivity , because we care about the individual 's perception here . So that being said , why quality of life ? Because if you are in um , challenging or stressing a situation , I choose to to to study the ultimate uh uh , the ultimate uh"
Environment," Journal of work . Thanks for carrying out the amazing team , it was coauthored by me and my uh close colleagues , research , colleagues and more money and algazo . Those are professors or associate professors of Rehabilitation Sciences at my beloved uh"
No," institution , Jordan , University of Science and Technology . The study was funded and ethically approved by Jordan , University of Science and Technology . So next slide please . So we aim to comprehensively investigate physical and mental health , related"
No," demographics lifestyle variables we conducted also sf12 and both components as we calculated the components , the PCS and the MCS , and we also collected uh mental health stress , including definition , anxiety and stress , using that 21 very beautiful and Powerful tool . I"
No," comparison with your usuals next , please ? Additionally , it does have questions about uh , your mental health and physical health . Eventually , as you can see at the bottom , are you you put the patient name or the client name , and then you calculate PCS and MCS , and now I want to"
No," was uh um bad because it 's less than that table uh . Now the between Majors . There were no mental health , uh component scores , uh significant differences , so mental health uh components were the same across Majors , but they were significantly"
No," to have a mental health issues differences across Majors , but I did expect that females are more stressed because this is consistent across all other status . Findings like a pain and and stress , are more prevalent among females . I do n't wan na enter aside"
No," discussion about hormones or gender Etc , but this is what we see in most studies . Some some researchers or fewer Searchers might claim that females report tend to report their pain and stress more than film and then mix . I"
No," predictors . So PCS or physical aspect of quality of life was significantly associated with anxiety . So the more you have anxiety , the less your BCS are uh . So the the the signal of the association is not included here , but it 's included in the paper uh . It was"
No," also significantly associated with GBA by itself . Evaluation and upper back hip musculoskeletal pain . So the more you have uh pain and muscular skills , the pain with the the less you , your physical quality of life , is called ads . On the other hand , the mental component"
Environment," score was uh significantly associated with clinical training hours , the more treated hours you get , the better . Your metal quality of life is , and with the stress uh , it was a negatively associated with this uh . It was also significantly associated"
No," first result it was a physical comparison between groups anyways University years , GBA , sleep , selfevaluation and Nickelback . All of these were the significantly Associated factors with with uh with the mental component scores next , please ."
No," sandals GBA average uh . We had that the we had significant prevalence of depression , anxiety and stress uh . The average was uh , average score was 14 , 15 and 17 . This indicates that the averages"
No," are more than normal in terms of levels of mental health centers , so most of our uh populations , our sample had uh mild or greater level of mental health . Symptoms , uh also uh . Musculoskeletal pain symptoms were prevalent mostly in Upper back hip and"
No," advice and neck , also our sample rated their diet as uh , mostly As sort of Heritage , and it was not unhealthy or totally healthy . So the perception about the diet was it 's a lot of healthy now . Also , we measured sleep equality at that time ."
No," Subjectively and essentially our studies adopted uh batsberg sleep equality index , but but we could n't use the standard device assessment for all variables that we were collecting anyways most of the students said that their sleep is not healthy or it was yeah , not unhealthy . I 'M"
No," sorry most of uh , our our uh participants , yes , say that it 's easy either uh , coffee or Italian broken . So most of them say that staring and broken their sleep patterns were not good . Next slide , please ! Okay ! So I uh . I went through uh this uh before so our overall uh"
No," Please and then uh . You can find this beautiful slide in my publication . This gives you the beta , which uh gives you the uh , the the direction of the association , whether it 's uh , positive or negative , for example , uh the beta for this anxieties with more"
No," anxiety , the physical component score get less because the signal is is minus and this table Maintained only the significant predictors of physical component uh scores of quality of life and met the model scores of a quality of life . What we did is uh , multiple linear"
No," two uh component scores . If you measure it by sf12 , one uh related more to the mental health and one related more to the physical health and again the same story . Uh applies on physical component scores . It 'S less than the entire population across the world and uh it 's"
No," I think what the we did here is . We uh did a cutoff score and we labeled students like disabled or not disabled . Maybe it was 15 . I do n't remember , but if you are interested , it 's very nice study and we did uh identify the predictors of uh neck disability , again anxiety , as you"
No," can say , uh major satisfaction being satisfied with your major uh uh , also uh Sleep Quality but specs PC Qi , but spread Quality of sleep and uh , what else uh ? Where were they ? These were the predictors or significant predictors of nexibility , but"
Environment," pain . So our main uh major this case was a Nordic Moscow , spiritual uh , uh questionnaire . This was published in the Journal of Moscow . Skeletal Rehabilitation , uh Moscow pain symptoms were prevalent among Allied Health students , majors"
Environment," and uh . Mostly , it was prevalent in uh neck , lower back and shoulder . These are the most prevalent areas or joints or sickness of the sickness , and this these musculoskeletal pain , uh complaints were associated with increased training load uh also uh , with"
No," mental stress symptoms and smartphone average units . This is this was interesting for us at that time . Maybe five years ago , the more you use your smartphone , the more you get , um pain , symptoms and the"
No," the conclusions of our studies are are similar that these problems , mental health , musculoskeletal or neck pain , disability are prevalent and administrators of academic institutions needs to take care uh With planning for their educational programs Etc"
No," offering treatment and prevention programs , so that I 'm not going through the conclusions of different studies . Next , please to prepare another study similar , but now targeted mental health symptoms . We found that mental health symptoms across different"
No," majors of Allied Health students are prevalent . If you consider deaths , which is uh , depression , anxiety and stress scale , I think having the cut off of minimum , I think uh nine for depression , seven for anxiety and 14 for"
No," uh stress at least 62 percent uh have depression . 65 percent of our sample had anxiety and 54 percent of our sample had stress , which means mild stress or higher okay again"
No," compared to males female short , more levels of stress and more levels of uh depression . But anxiety was the same again . Uh mental health symptoms are prevalent and we need to take care of these challenging issues . Now the predictors of mental health symptoms"
No," were gender physical , health , diet , quality of life , and now the predictors are important . I 'M talking fast here because we started late , but what we do by identifying the predictors is pointing to the administrators and stakeholders . If you influence these predictors or"
No," influence Associated factors , you might reduce the intensity of mental health issues or physical pain issues or quality of life issues . That 'S in theory , because our studies are crosssectional , we do n't have causality , but in theory these are the factors that"
No," contextual change . I expected to have some changes in mental health , physical health , Etc , and the interesting thing is the SF uh scores the physical and the mental component . Scores were higher than what I did find across our students before the pandemic ."
No," life is higher than uh than Allied Health . I do n't know , but but it 's worth uh to mention anyways most of the students were not satisfied with their online teaching so that the quality of life indicators were relatively low and we did identify the predictors uh"
No," one of the important predictors of quality of life . You recovered was the satisfaction with distance learning activities and physical activity level . You know how much Corona affected our physical activity , Etc . We also identified other uh"
No," relatives next slide . Please now for students , I do n't know if we have a lot of students uh . I do love to do experimental studies , but it 's uh . It costs much more time and resources than crosssectionals studies . Usually I do the design by the question . So most of"
No," the questions that I raised in my previous studies can be answered through crosssectional studies , but crossfiction studies are limited . They do n't offer a treatment interventions , new efficacy or causality . Now , when you do a little crosssectional studies , you"
No," might use linear or logistic regulation . This is just a tip for graduate students or individuals who are thinking about similar studies . Next , so crosssectional design is limited , it 's not the most popular design . I love it because it 's easy to answer some"
No," majority in our institutions , and most of our measures are selfreport . I do n't know if there 's a and then selfreport a measure for depression or quality of life , I 'm not aware . Maybe you can find for strength for ergonomics , but not for uh quality of"
No," life . Mental Health and Pain , Etc . Next slide , please so in future uh try to if you want to study such uh . If you wan na conduct such studies , try to make your study sample more homogeneous in terms of majors and and gender try to use limited"
No," cohort or traditional designs to see the progress of each problem uh across years , like what is the issue of quality of life Or situation , quality of life or mental health or musculoskeletal symptoms in the first year - and you know , goes to the graduation period on the"
No," second year and then experimental designs are always needed to test , to create and test and a new treatment methodologies that targets mental health . Physical health of life among students - next , please so in conclusion , we can say that uh"
No," mental health issues or symptoms , uh , physical uh , Health complaints or musculoskeletal uh pain . It has to be more specific , are prevalent among undergraduate students in Jordan . Also , the level of quality of life , it 's both types or subscores . The"
No," health and physical health , but for the sake of this presentation let us be focused more on the quality of life . We identify the predictors of quality of life in its both types or subscores , and these are delivered for stakeholders to and and administrators to think about it"
Environment," when designing academic plans and academic activities are needed and experimental studies are needed next slide , please . I always thank my great institution . They are generously financed , my education in the states and"
No," they are granting me grants to conduct research and to attend uh uh within workshops and alcohol process . Now I 'm going to France , I hope to meet all colleagues in Paris within the next two months or so at the end of August . Many many thanks for carrying Jacobs . I have"
No," and the lens resourcer and the editorial team . Thank you . My research team and colleagues I mentioned my uh coauthors in the previous slides . Thank you for your help and thanks for my graduate students , amazing Gladys students . Always I have to thank my wife and daughters ."
No," , creating uh a mobile app to treat uh workrelated musculoskeletal pain among office workers . We did publish that uh , so we might do something for undergraduate students , medical students or medical professional students"
No," creating something uh for for their mental or physical health to comply uh with the physical activity level , good sleep Etc . So now we did a lot of crosssection studies and started to do something experimental . I think that sounds great and this would be an"
No," app um targeted to students or or general population . We did one specific one for for office workers that for low back pain . Now we can we , we identified different problems across different occupational"
No," groups , including students . Now we are presenting today about students , I 'm answering you about students , so students , Mental Health students , musculoskeletal pain issues and are going next and students . Quality of life might be tackled through different"
No," Um , particularly during covid , you know we could , you know , do yoga from an app . We could do . You know um all sorts of ways of analyzing the ergonomics in our in our home um . I think that 's a great idea to have . Yes , the thing is , and it 's the challenge"
No," be something that um would be a wonderful project so um I I look forward mindfulness also mindfulness , for for mental health , so we can do a lot of mindfulness uh interventions that might uh help to reduce both of Mental and physical"
No," studies , mental health all always jump in our physical pain studies And vice versa , strongly jumps strongly . Yes , yes , well we 're going to have to conclude this webinar . Thank you for taking the time to share"
Environment," cost of equipment like xray machines , salaries of healthcare staff or the cost of transport to the health center . Direct costs are the main focus of most economic evaluations . Indirect costs are costs associated with"
No," reduced productivity due to the illness or its treatment . An example is missed wages because of not working due to the illness . Intangible costs are subjective , such as pain , suffering or grief . Due to the illness or treatment"
No," , these costs are quite hard to put a monetary value on that 's a look at the different types of costs . Now , let 's take a look at the different types of economic evaluations . The first type of economic evaluation is"
No," These are called natural units . Let 'S take a look at an example . Let 'S say we 're comparing two different interventions to reduce weight , a diet program and weight loss medication . The health outcome we 're interested in"
No, is how many kilos have been lost . The diet program had a two kilogram weight loss and cost three hundred dollars . The cost per kilo lost is one hundred and fifty dollars . This is called
No, say we want to compare between drug therapy to reduce high blood pressure . Breast screening to reduce the number of breast cancer cases and a kidney transplant for endstage kidney disease to improve kidney function . These are different health interventions
No," benefits . A variety of tools can be used . The willingness to pay method determines the value that people attach to health outcomes , for example by asking people how much they 're willing to pay to have the"
Environment, benefits of the treatment or to avoid the costs of illness . The human capital method places a monetary value on the person 's life . The value is based on the loss or gain of income due to the illness . Although this
No," type of evaluation is comprehensive , the data requirements can be quite high and there are methodological issues when it comes to determining a value on life and productivity . In reality , economic evaluations can be quite complex to do"
Environment," to them . It is very nice . I like variation . I , like anything , very different . I have a lot of visitor , it 's a noise when and people say do you want to hear better , because I then this is what I wanted while the company three months I did n't want to be here"
No," , you got ta be out there rubbing answer as I could n't Cope and the food 's good . They wait on you and the very fact that all my friend"
Environment," services to discuss what excellence means in a supported living setting . First , let 's meet the panel ann netten is a professor of social welfare who helped define excellence for the social care institute for excellence ."
Environment, Beadle brown is a reader in intellectual and development disability at the university of kent . Dorothy runicles uses social care services and is a campaigner for older people . The panel will be looking at how staff deliver good care
No," actually just sort of brings them out of themselves a bit yeah understanding goes both ways , so the carer learns as well as the person whose memory is being triggered . Um , but i i i think that the activities organizers"
No," feeding tasks etc , not just in the activity sessions when that 's what you you 're eight you 're , aiming for . One example of excellence is turning a problem into an opportunity with creative thinking . One nice"
No," nice little story when i started this job was um . We had a gentleman on our memory lane who fell in love with his wife again when she visited , and he kept asking her repeatedly to to marry him ."
No," memory , but have other parts of their memory , still very alert which give them pleasure it 's part of what what people 's lives consist of and it 's part of , anniversaries , weddings , parties , birthdays and so on are part of what we call"
No," and they 're suffering with alzheimer 's disease . We do n't work like that . You know this . This is a person , who 's got a name , that 's got , a family has got a life and we treat them in that way . A wood granger 's specialized dementia"
No, unit memory lane they try to use the resident 's personal experience to create relevant activities on our memory . Lane unit activities are 24 7 . If everyone gets up in the night and
No," wants to to do something , it 's they 'll do it . We try to do a lot of activities that could bring back memories , um nostalgic activities . I think the funny story is one day i 'll do shoe cleaning"
No," and i thought the gentleman would love that because of the forces and all this they 'll clean their shoes and all this . But i have n't got any black shoes men 's shoes , so i 've sort of quite secretly bought a pair of my husbands in"
No," black leather shoes , which was fine , gentlemen , clean them lovely . You can see your face in them , but unfortunately you wo n't give me him back . He thought they were his , so i had to own up to my husband when he wanted his shoes where they were ."
No," I said i think , there 's someone walking around with them on memory lane at work . This clip illustrates the point that we were talking about on the last one or the the one , the butterfly moments um clip um about"
No," , it 's a whole range of possibilities , is n't it yeah absolutely . Each month , wood grange holds a themed day to get residents and their families enjoying activities together . Today , it 's the home 's christmas party for activities coordinator sandra baker"
No," , it 's a big part of building relationships with residents and their families . Today we have music for health coming in , which is a real big favourite of wood . Grange , lots of action , lots of laughing music"
No," playing musical instruments , dancing singing everything that we 're good at here or we like to think we are we 're good at but um . But so these things i like we like to encourage families to take part in so that they 're all"
No, together and it 's nice for everybody else as well . Everybody else . These are the other people 's families and it 's a talking thing for them . Then they 'll talk about it . Fabulous
Environment," like they treat their own . They really are very lovable , and it does really make you feel good if we were thinking about what makes excellence in in in kind of social care um settings , one of the things would be that that"
No," if i was sitting staring at the wall ? How would i feel you get that real sense of engagement across the generations and involving the family , so they feel part of what 's going on in their homes and they can get the benefits as well ."
Environment," The panel has been encouraged by the examples . They'Ve seen these social care needs will remain with us and we have an aging population we 're living longer , and i think that not to see older people as a burden"
Environment," in residential care is that we need to focus on the relationships , the relationships between staff um and the the people that they are supporting and whatever environment that might be in that individualized care , Which can"
No," to relationships with family and friends . Okay , what is meant by puberty , so puberty is the stage when the reproductive organs develop and mature . This is called the secondary characteristics , so primary characteristics are the reproductive organs . You are born with the way we know"
No," , the answer is great . Graham adolescence , like yourself , should be able to work out the problem in your head . Okay , a child would have to write this down now this man who we 've encountered on previous videos Piaget , he describes his stage in adolescence , the intellectual stage as"
No," to seven children . They do not think in a logical way : they 're still egocentric , they think objects and animals are the same emotions as humans between the years 7 to 11 is the concrete operational stage . They begin to see things from others point of"
No," swings as well . Ok , social development . During this time , friends become more important than family ; ok , not absolutely more important , but compare definitely to in childhood , where the family , the mum and dads , probably a lot closer to the child . The"
No," Erik Erikson said that this is a developmental period when a person has to resolve a conflict in his or her own life in adolescence . Many people find the tension between the internal forces of the self , and the external forces of society is particularly high . Let 'S look"
No," at this example here here we have the mum and the daughter . The mum has brought up the daughter since she was a newly born child . Okay , she has loved her . She has given her all the rules and the values that the mum would like . The child to have , however , as"
No," the child gets older , becomes an adolescent . The adolescent , of course begins to realize there that they are unique . They are different . They have their own identity , which is not the same as their mom . Okay , they would like to express their identity . Maybe their"
No," values are different . Maybe what they want to do is not what their mom wants the child to do . Okay , the adolescent to do so . There is going to be this tension between the internal forces within the individual , the individual adolescent and the external forces of society , which"
No," could have had like the widening of the shoulders or hips development of body hair voice . Breaking for social . You could have had friends more important than family , socially independent for emotional , but be rebellious in the tone of a bell"
No," selfimage and the self esteem . Now I would try to answer this question in terms of pies . Okay , to help you at least break down your answer . If you 're talking about the physical changes , remember that 's going to be puberty now , as puberty arrives , the adolescent could"
No," can be linked to rapid mood , swings that can decrease your selfesteem yeah decrease your selfconcept . Okay , so might lead you to be rebellious fight against society against your people at home and angry socially friends replace family as the"
No," main source of support . Okay , so you can describe that and how that might affect you . So perhaps you now want to live up and show to your friends that you have a high status , that you are actually a decent person , you 're a good friend to"
