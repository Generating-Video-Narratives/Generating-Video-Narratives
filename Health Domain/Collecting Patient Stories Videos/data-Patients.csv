_4ehrdRPEqE,Alesha’s Story: Research Nurse and Lung Cancer Patient,3 months,2.49,979,,RocheDiagnosticsUSA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ehrdRPEqE,You can only imagine what the most,0.04,,
,,,,,,,,common response that I got . Wa did you,0.07,,
,,,,,,,,"smoke , you did n't even smoke . How could",0.11,,
,,,,,,,,you have lung cancer you 're a non,0.15,,
,,,,,,,,? Anyone with lung can get lung cancer,0.17,,
,,,,,,,,and that 's proven with me,0.19,,
,,,,,,,,. My name is Alicia Arnold and I am a,0.23,,
,,,,,,,,research nurse and I work in breast,0.27,,
,,,,,,,,oncology,0.3,,
,,,,,,,,"so , prior to being a lung cancer survivor",0.32,,
,,,,,,,,you 'd order test for patient and you,0.36,,
,,,,,,,,did it because that 's standard of care,0.4,,
,,,,,,,,", that 's driven per protocol . That 'S just",0.42,,
,,,,,,,,what we do with your disease,0.44,,
,,,,,,,,. However . Now I actually understand what,0.47,,
,,,,,,,,people are going through when they 're,0.51,,
,,,,,,,,"getting those test , so you can",0.53,,
,,,,,,,,completely relate to what they are going,0.54,,
,,,,,,,,through,0.58,,
,,,,,,,,. If there 's a silver lining to this story,0.59,,
,,,,,,,,", I had tested positive for a mutation of",1.02,,
,,,,,,,,which there wa targeted therapy,1.06,,
,,,,,,,,medicine that are already out there and,1.07,,
,,,,,,,,it wa an egfr mutation that I tested,1.1,,
,,,,,,,,positive for,1.13,,
,,,,,,,,so park because you can park and then,1.22,,
,,,,,,,,"you just like Rest , okay , now put it into",1.24,,
,,,,,,,,reverse,1.27,,
,,,,,,,,", so had I not",1.3,,
,,,,,,,,caught it at the time that I did,1.32,,
,,,,,,,,thing would have been a lot worse . For,1.35,,
,,,,,,,,"me , outcome would have been a lot worse",1.36,,
,,,,,,,,", but the fact that I caught it when I did",1.38,,
,,,,,,,,and that my doctor are being proactive,1.41,,
,,,,,,,,with my care . Perhaps this will give me,1.43,,
,,,,,,,,um more more time,1.47,,
,,,,,,,,. I remember having to explain to you that,1.51,,
,,,,,,,,you know they found cancer . The biopsy it,1.56,,
,,,,,,,,looked pretty bad at when you were first,1.59,,
,,,,,,,,diagnosed to stage four,2.01,,
,,,,,,,,". You know , God may not heal you",2.04,,
,,,,,,,,", but our journey could be a testimony to",2.07,,
,,,,,,,,save others,2.12,,
,,,,,,,,", and I thought that",2.14,,
,,,,,,,,that 's enough,2.16,,
,,,,,,,,foreign,2.19,,
,,,,,,,,take action a soon a possible,2.25,,
,,,,,,,,. It 'S just so important because I 'm,2.29,,
,,,,,,,,looking at my situation and I hope to,2.31,,
,,,,,,,,help others by just if they think,2.34,,
,,,,,,,,"something 's wrong act on it , do n't ignore",2.37,,
,,,,,,,,it.,2.4,,
