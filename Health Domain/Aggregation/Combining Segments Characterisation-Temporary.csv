I wa ill for aroundnine month with a series of infection ranging from bronchitis through pleurisy pneumonia .Eventually I wa admitted to hospital and wa in hospital for a week before I wa diagnosedwith bronchiectasis . At that time I wa told that : it is degenerative ; there is no cure ;it will get worse with time . I went through a range of emotion from being angry to the`` why me ?

So I 'm really concerned forsome of those child that the elderly who will have RSV and perhaps not be very sickcan give it to their young grandchild or great and cause them to be verysick .
